From the homepage:

: One nice feature in modern IDEs is the display of a faint one-pixel wide righthand margin that offers a visual clue to the length of each source code line.  [...]  You can achieve similar functionality in Emacs by marking lines which exceed a specified length (usually 80 characters) [...]

* http://www.xanadb.com/archive/emacs/20040630

Note that the version posted is broken in CVS GNU Emacs.  The MARGIN-CHANGE function doesn't correctly handle being run in the background by jit-lock (since it refers to the extent of the current window).  The symptom is an interruptible hang (^G) with Emacs burning 100% of CPU.  Replace the function's definition with the following:

  (defun margin-change (beg end)
    "Refresh margins in region BEG to END."
    (save-excursion 
      (dolist (o (overlays-in beg end))
        (when (margin-overlay-p o)
          (delete-overlay o)))

      (goto-char beg)
      (while (> end (point))
        (let ((start-of-line (line-beginning-position))
              (end-of-line (line-end-position)))
          (make-margin-overlay start-of-line end-of-line)
          (goto-char (+ end-of-line 1))))))

== Visualized Fill-column margin in GNU Emacs? ==

[new]
I am looking for a minor mode for emacs which shows the area right of the fill column in another color, regardless if any characters have been typed into that area or not. Think of a window which is split into two parts which differ by the background color: left a white part and right a light gray part which is beyond the fill column. Anyone? I've not been successfuly googling about that.

Thanks, Lennart

: There is vvb-mode.el --- a minor mode to display a Visible Vertical Bar(s). There is a XEmacs version on the EmacsLispList. a Variant for GNU Emacs was posted on gnu.emacs.sources on 2003-01-16

: Thank you for this tip. Unfortunately this script (I used the GNU Emacs 21 version available from http://gnufans.net/~deego/emacspub/site-lisp-not/vvb-mode.el.gz) doesn't work very well and doesn't show any bars when a line is shorter than the bar column. ;-(. It seems as if such a script is not possible to be implemented with current emacs.

: Thanks, Lennart

== Font-lock suggestion ==

[new]
I (and, it seems, many others) would like to be able to specify a
  right edge column and then have a single pixel wide line drawn at
  that column.  Such a feature has existed in many much simpler editors
  going back more than 10 years.  I have a colleague who uses CodeWright
  and that vertical bar is the only feature I covet. -- JohnYates

You can do this using font-lock mode.  Add a pattern that matches column N and then assign a face that has a pixmap with a single pixel vertical line.  -- AmitPatel
[new]
That sort of thing only works for lines which have text at that column,
though I'm not sure why anything else is necessary.
[new]
What I am using is highlight-beyond-fill-column. It only works for a specific fill-column though.

Lisp:column-marker.el does exactly what you're asking for.
