[http://wikemacs.org/ WikEmacs] (pronounced wiki-macs) collects useful resources for working with GnuEmacs.
It got started soon after [[2012-03-20]] in an effort to create a cleaned up wiki.

In January 2013 the project was announced to be [[http://news.slashdot.org/story/13/01/29/0242216/after-a-year-emacswiki-alternative-shutting-down|shutting down]], but the wiki announced it was [[http://wikemacs.org/index.php?title=Main_Page&oldid=3731|"under new management" in April 2013]] and [[http://wikemacs.org/index.php/Talk:Main_Page#WikEmacs_staying_open.3F_Great.21|staying open]]
