I am the author of  Orgmode's OpenDocument Exporter.   I no longer contribute to Emacs or participate actively in the mailing lists.  However, I continue to improve the OpenDocument exporter whenever I feel like.  See [[http://cauvery.nfshost.com/wiki.pl/ODT_Exporter]] for more information.

As a [[Friend of Emacs]], I run a gifting program.  See [[http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.devel/170681 Personal gift - INR 10,0000 - to new contributors]] for more information.
