I am the author of  Orgmode's OpenDocument Exporter.   

I no longer contribute to Emacs or actively participate in the list.  As a [[Friend of Emacs]], I run a gifting program.  See [[http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.devel/170681 Personal gift - INR 10,0000 - to new contributors]] for more information.
