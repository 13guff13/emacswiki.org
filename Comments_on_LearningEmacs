== Emacs Education ==

Has anyone made a Live DVD .iso for teaching Emacs and e-lisp? My recent versions of the Ubuntu Live DVD don't come with emacs.

I'd like to start experimenting while adapting ''Introduction to Emacs Lisp'' and ''The Schemer's Guide'' with ESL/EFL students. A light, bootable emacs .iso would make it easy to get started with students. Keeping a browser off the DVD might be a cunning incentive for students to leap ahead and learn w3 in large classes where some of the un-motivated will be tempted to do SNS instead of focusing on the class. 

I want to think about teaching(and learning) e-lisp in the style of I.A. Richards ''[[http://ebookbrowsee.net/english-through-pictures-by-i-a-richards-ch-gibson-pdf-d251834512| English Through Pictures]]'' books. With Richards's "Graded Direct Method" you create situations that show and don't tell. This way, learning English starts with a comparison of "I" and "You", and tries to let learners see how words work through comparison all the way through. I'm thinking  an adaptation of this  approach to e-lisp will be an effective way to learn English while learning something else useful. I'm hoping to learn e-lisp while thinking on examples to sequence in the same way. I have ideas for the first two examples but I want to start testing them with learners, and a live cd would be a great help once I get volunteers(which should be easy).

I hope this commenting page is an appropriate place to ask for .iso suggestions.

You can certainly post your comment here. However, I'd suggest that you create a new wiki page for your topic, as comments pages are really more for a discussion or miscellaneous comments, so (a) people won't necessarily look here to find that topic and (b) it might well get drowned by other, unrelated comments.

Wrt your iso question: I know nothing about ##.iso##, so I can't help you. What is your operating system?  If it is MS Windows, then there are binaries (executables) available for download.

The wiki is not so much a Q & A site, though you are welcome to ask questions here.  You might also try the ##.iso## question on one of the Stack Exchange sites.

I remember having worked on an EmacsBusinessCard -- a 50MB disk image with GNU/Linux, X11 and Emacs. I'm not aware of any recent efforts, however.
