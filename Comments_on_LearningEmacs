Emacs Education

Has anyone made a Live DVD .iso for teaching Emacs and e-lisp? My recent versions of the Ubuntu Live DVD don't come with emacs.

I'd like to start experimenting while adapting _Introduction to Emacs Lisp_ and _The Schemer's Guide_ with ESL/EFL students. A light, bootable emacs .iso would make it easy to get started with students. Keeping a browser off the DVD might be a cunning incentive for students to leap ahead and learn w3 in large classes where some of the un-motivated will be tempted to do SNS instead of focusing on the class. 

I want to think about teaching(and learning) e-lisp in the style of I.A. Richards _English Through Pictures_ books. With Richards's "Graded Direct Method" you create situations that show and don't tell. This way, learning English starts with a comparison of "I" and "You", and tries to let learners see how words work through comparison all the way through. I'm thinking  an adaptation of this  approach to e-lisp will be an effective way to learn English while learning something else useful. I'm hoping to learn e-lisp while thinking on examples to sequence in the same way. I have ideas for the first two examples but I want to start testing them with learners, and a live cd would be a great help once I get volunteers(which should be easy).

I hope this commenting page is an appropriate place to ask for .iso suggestions.
