I've been using Emacs since it was black-and-white -- back in the late eighties.

== Packages ==

Packages written or co-written by me:

* FollowMode -- Make side-by-side windows behave like a tall virtual window (bundled with Emacs)
* CWarnMode -- Highlight suspicious C construct like assignment inside expressions (bundled with Emacs)
* AutoRevertMode -- Automatically reloads buffer when file has been changed (bundled with Emacs)
* FontLockStudio -- Interactive debugger for FontLockMode keywords
* [[Multicolumn]] -- Support for multiple side-by-side windows
* CMakeFontLock -- Advanced highlight rules for [[CMake]]
* ObjcFontLock -- Highlight Objective-C method calls
* [[Prepaint]] -- Highlight C-style preprocessor directives, with multiline support
* ErlangMode -- Major mode for Erlang (co-authored with Robert Virding and many others)
* FoldingMode -- Minor mode for folding sections of text using special markers (Co-authored with JamieLokier and JariAalto)
* [[Faceup]] -- Regression test system for font-lock packages
* [[El2Markdown]] -- Generates MarkDown text files from Commentary section in emacs-lisp source files

== Obsolete packages ==

* [[CTypes]] -- Collected C and C++ type information back when FontLockMode required an explicit list
* [[AndersLJavaFontLock]] -- An, at the time, wide-spread set of highlight rules for Java

== Other Emacs-related activities ==

I'm somewhat involved in the OS X port of Emacs.
