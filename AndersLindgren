I've been using Emacs since it was black-and-white -- back in the late eighties.

== Packages ==

Packages written or co-written by me:

* FollowMode -- Make side-by-side windows behave like a tall virtual window (bundled with Emacs)
* CWarnMode -- Highlight suspicious C construct like assignment inside expressions (bundled with Emacs)
