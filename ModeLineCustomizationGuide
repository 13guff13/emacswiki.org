This is a '''guide''' to '''[[ModeLineConfiguration|mode line configuration]]'''. The [[ModeLine|mode line]] is at the bottom of every Emacs [[Window|window]] by default except the [[MiniBuffer|mini buffer]] window and includes some useful information. We customize the mode line by altering the `mode-line-format' variable (change `header-line-format' to customize the [[HeaderLine|header line]]).

==Information about the mode line==
The mode line is [[buffer]]-specific, meaning that the same buffer has the same mode line in different windows.


==Changing the mode line==
The mode line may be [[HideModeLine|hidden]] for a specific buffer by changing `mode-line-format' to `nil'.

The mode line normally looks something like this:

    -u:**-F1  *scratch*   All L12    (Lisp Interaction)-------%-

which is cryptic to most Linux users, so we want to make it more like this:

    Lisp Interaction: bufffer *scratch*, line 5 -- user: alice

using:

    (setq mode-line-format
          (list
           ;; value of `mode-name'
           "%m: "
           ;; value of current buffer name
           "buffer %b, "
           ;; value of current line number
           "line %l "
           "-- user: "
           ;; value of user
           (getenv "USER")))

==Mode-line format==
The mode line uses the same data structure as [[FrameTitle|frame titles]] and [[HeaderLine|header lines]]:
* '''string''' --- A string appears verbatim except for [http://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/_0025_002dConstructs.html#g_t_0025_002dConstructs %-Constructs].
* '''symbol''' --- A symbol stands for its value, the symbols `t' and `nil' are ignored as is any symbol whose value is void.
* '''(string rest...)''', '''(list rest...)''' --- A list whose first element is a string or list means to process all the elements recursively and concatenate the results. This is the most common form of mode-line construct.
