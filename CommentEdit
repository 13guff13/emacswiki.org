==What it does==
The Lisp:comment-edit.el lib allows creation/editing of shell-like (aka end-of-line) comments in a dedicated buffer. When the ##comment-edit## command is invoked, a buffer is popped up and the user edits the command as ordinary text in that buffer. When she is finished editing, ##C-cC-c## pops down the edit buffer and inserts the text with proper comment syntax into the original buffer.

==Installation==
Put the source file  into your %%load-path%%, optionally byte  compile it (with:
##emacs  -batch -f  batch-byte-compile comment-edit.el##)  and plop  the
following into your ##~/.emacs##:

{{{
(require 'comment-edit)
}}}



==Usage and description==
This code allows to create and/or edit shell-like (aka end-of-line)
comments in a dedicated buffer.

When the user invokes the main command, ##M-x comment-edit##, a
temporary buffer is popped up and the user typesets the comment as
ordinary text. When finished, typing ##C-cC-c## in the temporary
buffer pops down it and inserts the comment text into the original
buffer with the proper comment syntax.

The code was inspired by (and partially stolen from) ##c-comment-edit2##,
which does the same service for the block comments of the C language.

The main end-user commands are:

; ##M-x comment-edit##: create/edit a comment using current style (I bind this to ##C-ce##)
; ##C-uN M-x comment-edit##: create/edit a comment using style N
and set style N as the current
style (N=1,4; comment styles shown below)
; ##C-cC-c##: finish editing and insert comment text into the original buffer
; ##C-u M-x comment-edit##: ask in the minibuffer for the style to be set as the default for future calls

When the edited text is pasted into the original buffer, this can be
done in one of (presently) four possible comment styles.
(following examples are for the unix shell language)

; Style n. 1: "simplest"
 
{{{
     # comment line 1
     # comment line 2
     # comment line 3
}}}
 
; Style n. 2: "simple"
 
{{{
     #
     # comment line 1
     # comment line 2
     # comment line 3
     #
}}}
 
; Style n. 3: "narrow-box"
 
{{{
     ##################
     # comment line 1 #
     # comment line 2 #
     # comment line 3 #
     ##################
}}}
 
; Style n. 4: "wide-box"
 
{{{
     ########################################################################
     # comment line 1                                                       #
     # comment line 2                                                       #
     # comment line 3                                                       #
     ########################################################################
}}}
