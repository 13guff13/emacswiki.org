==What it does==
The Lisp:comment-edit.el lib allows creation/editing of shell-like (aka end-of-line) comments in a dedicated buffer. When the %%comment-edit%% command is invoked, a buffer is popped up and the user edits the command as ordinary text in that buffer. When she is finished editing, %%C-cC-c%% pops down the edit buffer and inserts the text with proper comment syntax into the original buffer.

==Usage and description==
TODO: for now, see the commentary in the source file
