Anybody interested in Bootstrap and JQuery and everything else that is new and fancy (says the old fart using Perl)... Have a look at [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs-test/?css= Emacs Wiki using a Bootstrap config file].

This is probably incompatible with any [[CSS]] you might be using.

It looks more and more likely that Emacs Wiki will eventually switch to the new look and feel.Thus, now's the time to use http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs-test/?css= and figure out what works and what doesn't. Let me know what you think, either by leaving a comment here or by sending me an email.
