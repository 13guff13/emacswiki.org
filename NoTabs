If you want to use spaces instead of tabs when indenting, put the following in your ~/.emacs file:

 (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)

You may also customize the `indent-tabs-mode' variable instead, obviously.
If you want to remove tabs in an existing file, mark the whole buffer using
C-x h and use M-x untabify.  (M-x tabify does the opposite...)

Discussion on why this is or is not a good idea: TabsAreEvil (or not).

If you wish to change the amount of spaces that the TAB key inserts, check out
the TabStopList page.  Do not confuse this with <code>tab-width</code>, which
is only good for displaying existing tabs in files!

The <code>tab-width</code> variable tells Emacs how long a tab is.
You might want to set it to something other than 8 before calling M-x untabify.

= So How Do I Insert a TAB If I Really Have To? =

Yes, of course you agree that TabsAreEvil. But you just ''have'' to indulge yourself a TAB from time to time - perhaps to create a file in some required format. Whaddya do?

`C-q' to the rescue! Don't forget it: `C-q' says "Insert the next character, whatever it is" (command <code>quoted-insert</code>).

So, `C-q TAB' does the trick.  -- DrewAdams
