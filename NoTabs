If you want to use spaces instead of tabs when indenting, put the following in your <tt>[InitFile .emacs]</tt> file:

    (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)

You may also customize the `indent-tabs-mode' variable instead, obviously. If you want to remove tabs in an existing file, mark the whole buffer using ##C-x h## and use ##M-x untabify##. (##M-x tabify## does the opposite ...)

Discussion on whether this is a good idea: TabsAreEvil (or not).

If you wish to change the amount of spaces that the Tab key inserts, check out the TabStopList page. Do not confuse this with ##tab-width##, which is only good for displaying existing tabs in files!

The ##tab-width## variable tells Emacs how wide a tab is (more precisely, the distance between tab stops). You might want to set it to something other than ##8## before calling ##M-x untabify##.

== So How Do I Insert a Tab If I Really Have To? ==

Yes, of course you agree that TabsAreEvil. But you just ''have'' to indulge yourself a tab from time to time -- perhaps to create a file in some required format. Whaddya do?

'##C-q##' to the rescue! Don't forget it: '##C-q##' says "insert the next character, whatever it is" (command ##quoted-insert##).

So, '##C-q <tab>##' does the trick. -- DrewAdams
