Gnu-emacs user.

I use Emacs from within Debian, Ubuntu, and Cygwin.

=== Using Emacs from within cygwin ===

<b>Problem:</b> aspell crashes with messages like:

    "^M.cset" could not be opened for reading or does not exist.lib/aspell/
    Aborted

Characteristic in this kind of error messages is the carry return character &quot;^M&quot;. Maybe, it is not even printed. Then the error messages often look like there is a file name missing. 

<b>Error description:</b> One cause of this error may be that the personal word list file or other configuration files of aspell in the user's home directory have DOS-line ends (CR-LF &quot;carry return&quot;+&quot;line feed&quot;).

The &quot;carry return&quot; is wrongly interpreted by aspell as configuration information. Often it is mistaken as a file name and the corresponding file can naturally not be found.

For example, this error occurs when you switch off the low-level CR-LF conversion of Cygwin. This may cause some trouble in finding the error since at a first glance it has nothing to do with emacs or aspell.

<b>Fix:</b> For each of the configuration files of aspell in your home directory (matching the file pattern .aspell*)

# load it into emacs
# change End-of-line style to unix by clicking onto &quot;(DOS)&quot; until it changes into &quot;:&quot;; This should mark the file as modified.
# save the file.
