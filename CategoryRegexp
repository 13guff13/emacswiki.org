This category is about regular expressions.  See also CategorySearchAndReplace.


= Understanding Regular Expressions =

* RegularExpression -- what are regular expressions, anyway?
* RegularExpressionHelp -- typical errors and frequently asked questions
* RegexpReferences -- where to look for more information
* NonGreedyRegexp -- how to write <code>.*?</code> in old emacsen
* MultilineRegexp -- how to match multiline stuff

= Using Regular Expressions Interactively =

* '''[[IncrementalSearch#RegexpSearches]]''' -- Using regexps with Isearch -- a good way to ''learn to use'' regexps
* [[Icicles]] -- Another good way to ''learn to use'' to use regexps -- lots of different uses, including:
** [[Completion]] and cycling of completion candidates through regexp matching
** a new kind of incremental search: use multiple simple regexps, instead of struggling with a complex regexp; and regexp subgroups are highlighted individually
* GrepMode -- `M-x grep' searches files for matches
* OccurBuffer -- `M-x occur' works on buffers like `M-x grep' does on files
* SearchBuffers -- Search *all* buffers
* [[Synonyms]] -- Use regexps to search for synonyms in a thesaurus.
* SearchAndReplaceDelimitedStrings -- Replace the prefix and suffix of a pattern while leaving the middle alone
* GrepList -- search a list of strings for a regexp, recursing into sublists
* OverlappingRegexps -- overlap regular expressions in a replace command
* RemembranceAgents -- show a list of related documents as you type
* RecursiveGrep -- various commands that recursively search a file system


= Programming with Regular Expressions =

* CaseFoldSearch -- controlling case sensitivity when searching
* [[Icicles - Defining Icicles Commands]] -- define multiple-choice commands that let users match regexp input against choices
* NonAsciiRegexps -- catering for non-ASCII characters
* ReBuilder -- build a regexp string and watch what it matches as you type
* SymbolicRegexp -- for programmers who want to write readable regular expressions
* Regex-tool -- similar to ReBuilder, found here ftp://ftp.newartisans.com/pub/regex-tool.el
* [[rx]] -- macro that generates regexps from sexps
