From their site:

: ''ImageMagick (TM), version 6.2.2, is a free software suite to create, edit, and compose bitmap images. It can read, convert and write images in a large variety of formats. Images can be cropped, colors can be changed, various effects can be applied, images can be rotated and combined, and text, lines, polygons, ellipses and BÃ©zier curves can be added to images and stretched and rotated.''

For more information, go to: http://www.imagemagick.org

Here's some Emacs things to let you harness imagemagick,

* EmacsImageManipulation -- manipulate images
* ThumbsMode -- browse and manipulate images
* [[Tumme]] -- creates its thumbnails with imagemagick

Some things I found while looking for a W32 version:

/GraphicsMagick is originally derived from ImageMagick 5.5.2/

: ftp://ftp.graphicsmagick.org/pub/GraphicsMagick/windows

/The author of sam2p recommends his program over ImageMagick:/
: http://www.inf.bme.hu/~pts/sam2p/

:: I tried it and it is true that it is faster than ImageMagick for certain operations. It also seems to create smaller file sizes. Thanks to you, I had to add possibilities to customize which tool to use in [[Tumme]], Grrrr! ... :) The [http://www.graphicsmagick.org/www/Copyright.html License] seems a bit complicated though... -- MaDa

I'm working on a patch to be able to use imagemagick to load for instance .djvu files in emacs. See emacs-devel mailing list for the patch --JoakimVerona
