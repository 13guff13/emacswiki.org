Gentoo has a offical Gnus Cvs Package in his Portage Tree.

To install just execute this command:

 ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~x86" emerge gnus-cvs

[new:StefanKamphausen:2009-09-22 11:33 UTC] As of today (2009-09-22) I don't have that ebuild on my machine.  However Emacs 23.1 is stable and ships with Gnus.

Hint: There is also a Emacs CVS Package available.
