parenface.el, written by DavePearson, is an Emacs hack that lets you define a [[Face]] in which parens should appear. It's nice to "tone down" parens in Lisp source, for instance.

== Color suggestion ==

Dark blue parentheses:

    (require 'parenface)
    (set-face-foreground 'paren-face "blue4")
