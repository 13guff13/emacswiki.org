A tool to help with ELPA-like packages.

ElpaKit can do 2 useful things:

* it can make packages (mostly this is difficult for tar packages) from source files
* it can make local package archives full of packages from source files

This last feature is particularly useful if you want to use a LocalElpaArchive.

== Other things ElpaKit can do ==

* run tests in clean emacsen on packages built from source files
* run clean daemon servers with packages built from source files
* eval all the code you declare in packages

== Get it ==
ElpaKit is available from marmalade.

The source is on [[http://github.com/nicferrier/elpakit|github, here]].

A very comprehensive [[https://github.com/nicferrier/elpakit/blob/master/README.creole|README]] is included on GitHub.
