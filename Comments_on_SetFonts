I don't care about all this fancy stuff.  Somebody decided to default the font to variable pitch and I want fixed width.  Courier, please.  This page is too impenetrable to figure out how to default to courier.  How do I do that?

Dear Anonymous: [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs-en/SetFonts#toc2 Globally Change the Default Font]

in your case, add this to your .emacs (or whatever) file: <code>(set-face-attribute 'default nil :font "Courier")</code>

To view available fonts on your system, look at <code>(font-family-list)</code>
