I don't care about all this fancy stuff.  Somebody decided to default the font to variable pitch and I want fixed width.  Courier, please.  This page is too impenetrable to figure out how to default to courier.  How do I do that?

Dear Anonymous: [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs-en/SetFonts#toc2 Globally Change the Default Font]

in your case, add this to your .emacs (or whatever) file: <code>(set-face-attribute 'default nil :font "Courier")</code>

To view available fonts on your system, look at <code>(font-family-list)</code>

Regarding  the part:

To change the default font for new (non special-display) frames, put either of these in your init file:

    (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(font . FONT ))
    (set-face-attribute 'default t :font FONT ))
[/quote]
I understand how when we are in the middle of an emacs session it'd help to have an option to change the
font only of the future-new frames.
But i dont understand the difference of using the 't', or 'nil' option in an .init file when starting a new emacs session . Doesnt it hold than in that case all frames are newones making 't' superfluous in .init file?
