== Getting Emacs via Git ==

Emacs Git repositories are available from a number of places. The official one is Savannah.

Getting Emacs via Git:

{{{
git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs.git
}}}

This clones the Emacs Git repository from Savannah, including all of the branches in that repository.

If disk space is at a premium, you can clone a //shallow// repository, with history truncated to just a handful of the latest revisions.  This uses much less space, but is severely limited in its usability: you cannot clone or fetch from such a repository, nor push from or to it.  Thus, a shallow repository is useless for you if you want to contribute to Emacs development (which is what this page is for).  Here's how to create a shallow clone with history for only 2 last revisions:

{{{
git clone --depth 1 git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs.git
}}}
