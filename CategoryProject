Project management in Emacs.  Managing groups of files together, especially code.

== Full Project Management Libraries ==

These libraries (though they may be at varying stages of development) have the goal to be full project-management solutions.  Each offers its own way of thinking about a project, or uses a project definition created by another piece of software.

It is probably not useful to use more than one of these at the same time, for the same project.

* [https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile projectile]
* [http://wiki.github.com/jrockway/eproject eproject] -- assign files to projects, programatically
* a different library named [[eproject]] -- Project workspaces for Emacs.
* [http://cedet.sourceforge.net/projects.shtml CEDET]
* [[project-buffer-mode.el]]
* [http://github.com/mattkeller/mk-project mk-project] --  Quickly switch between projects and perform operations on a per-project basis.

* FsProject -- plugin for ProjectBufferMode 
* SlnMode -- SLN file plugin for ProjectBufferMode 
* [[IProject]] -- interactive project plugin for ProjectBufferMode 
* ProjmanMode -- emphasis on the ability to switch between projects
* SimpleProjectManagment

== Project Helpers or Simplified Project Libraries ==

These libraries address some aspect of project management without trying to be all-in-one solutions.  You may find it helpful to use several of these at the same time, even in addition to the all-in-one solutions in the section above.

* Searching

== Utilities ==

These libraries have little to do with project management **per se**, but are handy when dealing with many files or buffers at once.

* MultiTerm
* DiredMode -- Operate on files.
** [[GrepMode#GrepOnlyMarkedFiles|grep only marked files in Dired]] -- search subsets of files
