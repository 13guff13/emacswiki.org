It's a useful snippet, but I don't need it so often, so I write it again and again which is wasteful, so I put it here instead. This way I can find it here and others can use it too.

I usually just copy this into `eval-expression':

<pre>
(let (lines)
  (goto-char (point-min))
  (while (not (eobp))
    (let ((line (buffer-substring (line-beginning-position) (line-end-position)))
          (start (line-beginning-position)))
      (forward-line)
      (if (member line lines)
          (delete-region start (point))
        (push line lines)))))
</pre>

Thanks for posting your code on Emacs Wiki.  There are two implementations for deleting duplicate lines.  See [[uniquify]] and DuplicateLines.  Looks like yours could be included on the latter as an alternative.  Shall we delete this page and move it there? -- AaronHawley

DuplicateLines is a subsection of MultilineRegexp and this solution doesn't use regexes, so it doesn't make much sense to move this code there. On the other hand, the solution on the MultilineRegexp page is also about deleting duplicate lines, so it would make more sense to move that code here and place a link to this page there.
