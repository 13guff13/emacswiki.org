== About ==

Emacs has a powerful undo system. Unlike the standard undo/redo system in most software, it allows you to recover ''any'' past state of a buffer (whereas the standard undo/redo system can lose past states as soon as you redo). However, this power comes at a price: many people find Emacs' undo system confusing and difficult to use, spawning a number of packages that replace it with the less powerful but more intuitive undo/redo system (see CategoryUndo).

Both the loss of data with standard undo/redo, and the confusion of Emacs' undo, stem from trying to treat undo history as a linear sequence of changes. It's not. The ##undo-tree-mode## provided by this package replaces Emacs' undo system with a system that treats undo history as what it is: a branching tree of changes. This simple idea allows the more intuitive behaviour of the standard undo/redo system to be combined with the power of never losing any history. An added side bonus is that undo history can in some cases be stored more efficiently, allowing more changes to accumulate before Emacs starts discarding history.

It gets better. You don't have to imagine the undo tree, because ##undo-tree-mode## includes an undo-tree visualizer which draws it for you, and lets you browse around the undo history.

The only downside to this more advanced yet simpler undo system is that it was inspired by Vim. But, after all, most successful religions steal the best ideas from their competitors!

For more information, see the Commentary at the top of the ##undo-tree.el## file.

== Contributing ==

Please send bug reports and suggestions to [mailto:toby-undo-tree@dr-qubit.org toby-undo-tree@dr-qubit.org] (you can post them here as well if you like, of course). I don't check this page regularly, so anything not emailed to me is likely to languish here unnoticed for some time.

If you have code you would like to contribute to undo-tree, either send a patch against the latest development version to [mailto:toby-undo-tree@dr-qubit.org toby-undo-tree@dr-qubit.org], or better still, use git, rebase your work against the latest git HEAD, and let me know where to find your clone of the undo-tree repository so that I can pull your changes.
