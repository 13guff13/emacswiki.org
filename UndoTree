== About ==

Emacs has a powerful undo system. Unlike the standard undo/redo system in most software, it allows you to recover ''any'' past state of a buffer (whereas the standard undo/redo system can lose past states as soon as you redo). However, this power comes at a price: many people find Emacs' undo system confusing and difficult to use, spawning a number of packages that replace it with the less powerful but more intuitive undo/redo system (see CategoryUndo).

Both the loss of data with standard undo/redo, and the confusion of Emacs' undo, stem from trying to treat undo history as a linear sequence of changes. It's not. The ##undo-tree-mode## provided by this package replaces Emacs' undo system with a system that treats undo history as what it is: a branching tree of changes. This simple idea allows the more intuitive behaviour of the standard undo/redo system to be combined with the power of never losing any history. An added side bonus is that undo history can in some cases be stored more efficiently, allowing more changes to accumulate before Emacs starts discarding history.

It gets better. You don't have to imagine the undo tree, because ##undo-tree-mode## includes an undo-tree visualizer which draws it for you, and lets you browse around the undo history. It also sports various other nifty features: persistent saving of undo history across sessions (only works with sufficiently recent Emacsen), storing and restoring past buffer states in registers, a diff view of the changes that will be made by undoing, and probably more besides.

The only downside to this more advanced yet simpler undo system is that it was inspired by Vim. But, after all, most successful religions steal the best ideas from their competitors!

== Downloading ==

The undo-tree package is available from GNU [[ELPA]] in recent Emacsen. The latest "stable" version (version 0.6, released November 2012) can also be downloaded from:

* Undo-tree package download: http://www.dr-qubit.org/download.php?file=undo-tree/undo-tree.el
* Web-site: http://www.dr-qubit.org/emacs.php#undo-tree

If you want to live on the bleeding edge, the latest "development" version can be found in a git repository located at:

* Undo-tree git repository: http://www.dr-qubit.org/git/undo-tree.git

This is a git repository, ''*not*'' a web page. You cannot view it in a web browser. To grab the latest development version, clone the repository using:

    git clone http://www.dr-qubit.org/git/undo-tree.git


== Contributing ==

Please send bug reports and suggestions to [mailto:toby-undo-tree@dr-qubit.org toby-undo-tree@dr-qubit.org] (you can post them here as well if you like, of course). I don't check this page regularly, so anything not emailed to me is likely to languish here unnoticed for some time.

If you have code you would like to contribute to undo-tree, either send a patch against the latest development version to [mailto:toby-undo-tree@dr-qubit.org toby-undo-tree@dr-qubit.org], or better still, use git, rebase your work against the latest git master, and let me know where to find your clone of the undo-tree repository so that I can pull your changes.
