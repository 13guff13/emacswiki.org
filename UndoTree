== About ==

Emacs's undo system allows you to recover ''any'' past state of a buffer. To do this, Emacs treats "undo" itself as just another editing action that can be undone. This can be confusing and difficult to use. If you make an edit while undoing multiple changes, you "break the undo chain". To get back to where you were, you have to undo all the undos you just did, then undo all the changes you'd already undone before. Oly /then/ can you continue undoing from where you left off. If this sounds confusing, it's because it is! Hence, a number of packages exist that replace it with the undo/redo system (see CategoryUndo).

Instead of treating undo/redo as a linear sequence of changes, ##undo-tree-mode## treats undo history as a branching tree of changes, similar to the way Vim handles it. This makes it substantially easier to undo and redo any change, while preserving the entire history of past states. The undo-tree visualizer is particularly helpful in complex cases. An added side bonus is that undo history can in some cases be stored more efficiently, allowing more changes to accumulate before Emacs starts discarding history. Undo history can be saved persistently across sessions with Emacs 24.3 and later. It also sports various other nifty features: storing and restoring past buffer states in registers, a diff view of the changes that will be made by undoing, and probably more besides.

For more information, see the Commentary at the top of the ##undo-tree.el## file.

== Downloading ==

The undo-tree package is available from GNU [[ELPA]] in recent Emacsen, and in [[el-get]]. You can install it with `M-x install-package undo-tree'. The latest "stable" version (version 0.6.4, released August 2013) can also be downloaded from:

* Undo-tree package download: http://www.dr-qubit.org/download.php?file=undo-tree/undo-tree.el
* Web-site: http://www.dr-qubit.org/emacs.php#undo-tree

If you want to live on the bleeding edge, the latest "development" version can be found in a git repository located at:

* Undo-tree git repository: http://www.dr-qubit.org/git/undo-tree.git

This is a git repository, ''*not*'' a web page. You cannot view it in a web browser. To grab the latest development version, clone the repository using:

    git clone http://www.dr-qubit.org/git/undo-tree.git

To enable it, add it to your LoadPath (if necessary), then add the following to your InitFile:

   (global-undo-tree-mode)

== Customizing undo-tree ==

Here are a few options you may want to investigate:

* ##undo-tree-visualizer-diff## - Show diffs when browsing through the undo tree
* ##undo-tree-visualizer-timestamps## - Show relative times in the undo tree visualizer
* ##undo-tree-auto-save-history## - Save history to a file

See `M-x customize-group undo-tree' for more options.

== Contributing ==

Please send bug reports and suggestions to [mailto:toby-undo-tree@dr-qubit.org toby-undo-tree@dr-qubit.org] (you can post them here as well if you like, of course). I don't check this page regularly, so anything not emailed to me is likely to languish here unnoticed for some time.

If you have code you would like to contribute to undo-tree, either send a patch against the latest development version to [mailto:toby-undo-tree@dr-qubit.org toby-undo-tree@dr-qubit.org], or better still, use git, rebase your work against the latest git master, and let me know where to find your clone of the undo-tree repository so that I can pull your changes.
