With zsh or eshell you can use **/*.[ch] to expand into a list of all
files matching *.[ch].

And so much more.  First, there is normal globbing:

; *.c : all files ending in .c
; ?.c : any single character followed by .c
; [a-f]*.c : any file beginning a-f followed by .c

There is extended globbing:

; a#.c : a C file named by at least one 'a' character
; a##.c : a C file named by one or more a characters

There is recursive globbing:

; */*.c : all C files in all subdirectories
; <nowiki>*/CVS/Root</nowiki> : all CVS/Root files

There is predicated globbing:

; e*(*) : all executable files beginning with e
; */*(@) : all symbolic links (searched recursively)
; */*(a+30) : all files not accessed in the last 30 days

There is filtered globbing:

; *.c(<nowiki>:U</nowiki>) : all C filenames in uppercase

All of these features are support by both zsh[http://sunsite.dk/zsh/Doc/]
and Eshell.  In fact,
Eshell was implemented in terms of the zsh 4.0 InfoMode manual, so I
recommend reading there. -- JohnWiegley

Further, Eshell allows for Lisp ties in to the predication and
filtering rules:

; *.c('file-writable-p) : Lispy way of doing *.c(w)
; *.c(|upcase) : Lispy way of doing *.c(<nowiki>:</nowiki>U)
