S/MIME support in Gnus is somewhat limited.  ExtendSMIME redefines some Gnus
functions and adds new ones to include proper support for multiple
recipients, retrieval and caching of certificates from LDAP servers, and
(via DefaultEncrypt) automatic insertion of MML tags into messages if
certificates for all recipients are available.

A signed version of jl-encrypt.el is available
[http://www.informationelle-selbstbestimmung-im-internet.de/emacs/ over there].

For basic setup information concerning S/MIME in GNU Emacs (Gnus, in
fact), I recommend that you read Info node
[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/message/Security.html(message) Security]
and the Wiki entry GnusSMIME.

==Preliminaries==
In general, I recommend GnuPG over S/MIME (which is the default for Gnus).
Unless you are in a restricted setting, say in a university or corporate
setting, the trust model regarding certificate authorities is broken.
You may want to recall the recent certificate authority failures concerning
[https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/sjs/diginotar-hack-highlights-critical-failures-our-ssl-web-security-model DigiNotar]
and [http://www.h-online.com/news/item/Trustwave-issued-a-man-in-the-middle-certificate-1429982.html Trustwave].
Although the impact of those failures appears to be restricted to SSL
certificates, I don't see any reason why S/MIME certificates should be more
trustworthy.

==Installation==
Put Lisp:jl-smime.el and Lisp:jl-encrypt.el into your load-path and add the following to ~/.emacs.
{{{
    (load "jl-smime")
}}}
In general, no further configuration should be necessary.

Note that jl-smime.el contains the following:
{{{
;; I'm searching for S/MIME certificates via LDAP at DFN-Verein.
(require 'ldap)
(setq ldap-default-base "O=DFN-Verein,C=DE"
      ; -x: no SASL authentication, -tt: store result in file
      ldap-ldapsearch-args '("-x" "-tt")
      )

;; Cache S/MIME passphrase for 600 seconds.  (Default is 16.)
(require 'password-cache)
(setq password-cache-expiry 600)
}}}
You may want to adjust those settings.
