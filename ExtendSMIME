S/MIME support in Gnus is somewhat limited.  ExtendSMIME redefines some Gnus
functions and adds new ones to include proper support for
* multiple recipients (smime-encrypt-region enhanced),
* retrieval  and caching of certificates from LDAP servers
  (smime-cert-by-ldap-1 redefined, including a bug fix),
* extraction and caching of certificates from signed messages
  (smime-verify-region enhanced),
* and (via jl-encrypt.el) automatic insertion of MML tags into messages if
  certificates for all recipients are available.

The general idea of ExtendSMIME is to store available certificates in
files under smime-certificate-directory.  The file names under which a
certificate is stored are its e-mail addresses.
A certificate file is written in two cases:  First, if a certificate is
received on demand via LDAP.  Second, if a signed message containing a
certificate is verified successfully then the contained certificate is
stored for each of its e-mail addresses.

Signed versions of jl-smime.el and jl-encrypt.el are available
[http://www.informationelle-selbstbestimmung-im-internet.de/emacs/ over there].

For basic setup information concerning S/MIME in GNU Emacs (Gnus, in
fact), I recommend that you read Info node
[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/message/Security.html(message) Security]
and the Wiki entry GnusSMIME.

==Preliminaries==
In general, I recommend GnuPG over S/MIME (which is the default for Gnus).
Unless you are in a restricted setting, say in a university or corporate
setting, the trust model regarding certificate authorities is broken.
You may want to recall the recent certificate authority failures concerning
[https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/sjs/diginotar-hack-highlights-critical-failures-our-ssl-web-security-model DigiNotar]
and [http://www.h-online.com/news/item/Trustwave-issued-a-man-in-the-middle-certificate-1429982.html Trustwave].
Although the impact of those failures appears to be restricted to SSL
certificates, I don't see any reason why S/MIME certificates should be more
trustworthy.

==Installation==
Put Lisp:jl-smime.el and Lisp:jl-encrypt.el into your load-path and add the following to ~/.emacs.
{{{
    (load "jl-smime")
}}}
In general, no further configuration should be necessary.

Note that jl-smime.el contains the following:
{{{
;; I'm searching for S/MIME certificates via LDAP at DFN-Verein.
(require 'ldap)
(setq ldap-default-base "O=DFN-Verein,C=DE"
      ; -x: no SASL authentication, -tt: store result in file
      ldap-ldapsearch-args '("-x" "-tt")
      )

;; Cache S/MIME passphrase for 600 seconds.  (Default is 16.)
(require 'password-cache)
(setq password-cache-expiry 600)
}}}
You may want to adjust those settings.
