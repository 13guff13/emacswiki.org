Sometimes you want to bind a key to some code.  You can use a lambda
to create an anonymous function; but that is not enough.  You must
make it interactive, too:

    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c t")
                    (lambda ()
                      (interactive)
                      (set-default 'truncate-partial-width-windows
                                   (not truncate-partial-width-windows))
                      (message "truncate-partial-width-windows: %S"
                               truncate-partial-width-windows)))

If you use this often, a macro like this might be useful:

    (defmacro aif (&rest forms)
      "Create an anonymous interactive function.
    Mainly for use when binding a key to a non-interactive function."
      `(lambda () (interactive) ,@forms))

Then:

    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c t")
                    (aif (set-default 'truncate-partial-width-windows
                                      (not truncate-partial-width-windows))
                         (message "truncate-partial-width-windows: %S"
                                  truncate-partial-width-windows)))
