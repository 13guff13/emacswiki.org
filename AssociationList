The ElispManual does a stand-up job of introducing some of the primitive functions for operating with association lists.  More significant tasks can be accomplished with the `alist' library that comes with [[APEL]].

* GIT:a.el/alist.el

To use the library in your code you must require it with:

   (require 'alist)

To change or add a key-value pair, use `set-alist'.

    (setq test-alist '((a . 0) (b . 1)))
    ==> ((a . 0) (b . 1))
    
    (set-alist 'test-alist 'a 9)
    ==> ((a . 9) (b . 1))
    
    (set-alist 'test-alist 'c 3)
    ==> ((c . 3) (a . 9) (b . 1))

To delete a key-value pair, use `remove-alist'.

    (remove-alist 'test-alist 'a)
    ==> ((c . 3) (b . 1))
