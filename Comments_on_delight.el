Dunno why PhilS deleted it. I rolled it back, for now. I'm guessing that Phil had a good reason and can mention that here. It is his library, after all.

I'm guessing he wants to host it from GitHub. Here's a copy I found: https://github.com/phil-s/emacsd/tree/53afb004856c2eaabe86543af7fea196dd04cbc1/el-get/delight
