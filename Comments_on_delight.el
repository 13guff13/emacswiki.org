Why delete this page? MELPA still fetches its delight.el package's source from here.

Dunno why PhilS deleted it. I rolled it back, for now. I'm guessing that Phil had a good reason and can mention that here. It is his library, after all.

I'm guessing he wants to host it from GitHub. Here's a copy I found: https://github.com/phil-s/emacsd/tree/53afb004856c2eaabe86543af7fea196dd04cbc1/el-get/delight

OK. In that case, he probably needs to update the recipe for MELPA, to pull from there instead of here. At that point it would probably be good to delete the copy here.
