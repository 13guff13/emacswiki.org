This page is about library '''<tt>[[zones.el]]</tt>''', which lets you easily define and subsequently act on multiple zones of buffer text --- in effect, multiple [[region]]s.

(Library <tt>[[zones.el]]</tt> supersedes library <tt>[[wide-n.el]]</tt>, which is now obsolete (as of 2015-08-16).


A zone records two buffer positions and an optional list of additional information (whatever you like).  Each buffer position can be a marker, which means that a list of zones can specify zones in different buffers.

A position can also be a ''readable marker'', which is a Lisp sexp that can be written to disk (e.g., as part of a bookmark or saved variable), and restored in a later Emacs session by reading the file where it is saved.

(Commands that use zones typically act on ''izones'', which are just zones that are labeled with a numeric identifier.)

You can do the following with a list of zones:

* Sort them.
* Coalesce adjacent or overlapping zones (which includes sorting them).
* Intersect them.
* Narrow the buffer to zones in the list.
* Select zones in the list as the active [region].  Cycle among regions.
* Search them (they are automatically coalesced first).  For this
you need library <tt>[[isearch-prop.el]]</tt> (see [[Isearch+]]).
* Highlight and unhighlight them.  (For this you need the [[HighlightLibrary|Highlight]] library (<tt>[[highlight.el]]</tt>) or library <tt>[[facemenu+.el]]</tt>.
* Push the active [[region]] to a list of zones.
* Delete a zone from a list of zones.
* Make a list-of-zones variable persistent, in a bookmark.  Use the
bookmark to restore it in a subsequent Emacs session.  For this
you need library [[Bookmark+]].

Zone commands are bound to keys on keymap `narrow-map' (prefix key `C-x n'):

* '''`C-x n C-d'''' (`zz-izone-delete') -- Delete a zone from the current list of zones.
* '''`C-x n d''''   (`narrow-to-defun') -- Standard, except that it is advised to update the current list of zones with the narrowing.
* '''`C-x n h''''   (`hlt-highlight-regions') -- Highlight zones in the current buffer.
* '''`C-x n H''''   (`hlt-highlight-regions-in-buffers') -- Highlight zones in multiple buffers.
* '''`C-x n n''''   (`narrow-to-region') -- Standard, except that it is advised to update the current list of zones with the narrowing.
* '''`C-x n p''''   (`narrow-to-page') (standard, except that it is advised to update the current list of zones with the narrowing)
* '''`C-x n r''''   (`zz-select-region-repeat') -- Cycle zones as the active [[region]]: '''`##C-x n r r r ...##''''
* '''`C-x n s''''   (`zz-izone-add') -- Add the active [[region]] to the current list of zones.
* '''`C-x n S''''   (`zz-izone-add-and-coalesce') -- Add the the region to the current list of zones, and then coalesce the zones.
* '''`C-x n u''''   (`zz-izones-coalesce') -- Coalesce the zones in the current list.
* '''`C-x n w''''   (`widen') -- Standard.
* '''`C-x n x''''   (`zz-narrow-repeat') -- Cycle as zones as buffer narrowings: '''`##C-x n x x x ...##''''
