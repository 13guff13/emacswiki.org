This page is about library '''<tt>[[zones.el]]</tt>''', which lets you manipulate multiple buffer zones --- in effect, multiple [[region]]s.

A zone records two buffer positions and an optional list of additional information (whatever you like).  Each buffer position can be a marker, which means that a list of zones can specify zones in different buffers.

You can do the following with a list of zones:

* Sort them.
* Coalesce adjacent or overlapping zones, to give their union.
* Intersect them.


Library ##zones.el## is used by commands `wide-n-unite' and `wide-n-add-to-union' of library '''<tt>[[wide-n.el]]</tt>'''.
