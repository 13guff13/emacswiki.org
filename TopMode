top-mode.el can run the unix programm "<tt>top</tt>" from Emacs.

You can find it here: Lisp:top-mode.el

=== Installation ===

Load it with <tt>auoload</tt> or <tt>require</tt>.
The enter

 M-x top-mode

or load it permanently with

 (top-mode 1)

in your emacs configuration file.

=== Usage ===

Press <tt>g</tt> to run top and <tt>q</tt> to quit.
Other features are:

* strace a process
* kill processes
* renice processes

=== Autorefresh ===
If you want this to auto-refresh like the shell's top, you might add the following to your .emacs. It binds the A key in top-mode to an interactive function. Set the refresh rate in seconds, and turn off by setting the refresh rate to 0.

Note that a refresh rate of 1 is not recommended, as the <tt>top</tt> function moves point to top's buffer. This leaves little time to render the prompt and let the user change the refresh rate in the minibuffer. 

It would be nice if <tt>top</tt> updated its buffer without moving point, so you could have top in one buffer and work in another.

 (defun top-auto-refresh (rate)
   (interactive "nTop refresh rate (seconds): ")
   (progn
     (cancel-function-timers 'top)
     (if (not (zerop rate))
         (setq *top-refresh-timer* 
               (run-with-timer 2 rate 'top)))))
 (define-key top-mode-map "A" 'top-auto-refresh)
