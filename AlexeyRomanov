I use Emacs because I like experimenting with languages like Erlang, Haskell and Ruby,
and I've found there is practically always a Emacs mode for any language which is at least comparable to a dedicated IDE (which may not exist) and for which I don't need to learn a whole new set of key bindings.

Recently switched to using ViperMode + [[vimpulse.el]], which gives me access to the power of Vim to edit text even better.
