Ask questions, answer questions, build up your reputation. Have fun!

There are two %%StackExchange%% places for Emacs.  Each has about the same amount of traffic and equally interesting questions and answers:

* [[http://emacs.stackexchange.com/ Emacs.StackExchange]]

* [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/emacs StackOverflow, tag `emacs']] (just add tag '''##emacs##''' when you post a question)



See also [[https://github.com/vermiculus/sx.el sx.el]], a %%StackExchange%% interface for Emacs.
