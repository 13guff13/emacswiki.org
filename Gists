: "[https://gist.github.com/Gist Gist] is a simple way to share snippets and pastes with others. All gists are git repositories, so they are automatically versioned, forkable and usable as a git repository."

You can transclude a gist by writing ##<include gist "...">## and putting the URL where the ellipsis is.

Random gist example:

{{{
<include gist "https://gist.github.com/1236665">
}}}

Results in:

<include gist "https://gist.github.com/1236665">

(This feature [http://wrttn.in/3afc42 inspired by a rant]!)

Note that /you will not see anything at all/ unless you permit javascript from /both/ github.com and emacswiki.org to execute in your browser.

(It would be good if at least a plain link to the gist URL would be provided as well to account for the non-javascript case, as you /can/ view the code at https://gist.github.com/1236665 without any javascript enabled.)
