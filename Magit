== Crash Course ==

Getting started with Magit is really easy:
 
* M-x magit-status to see git status, and in the status buffer:
* s to stage files
* c c to commit (type in your commit message then C-c C-c to save the message and commit)
* b b to switch to a branch

Other handy keys:

* P P to do a git push
* F F to do a git pull
* try to press TAB

== Auto updating the status buffer ==
If you are using Emacs 24.4 on Linux with inotify support then you can get the status buffer to automatically update on file changes by loading the file magit-inotify.el from ##contrib/## (https://github.com/magit/magit/blob/master/contrib/magit-inotify.el) and activating the ##magit-inotify-mode## minor mode. (Interesting, but the link seems broken.)

== Link to magit from org documents ==
The [https://github.com/sigma/org-magit org-magit] package provides a link type to magit for OrgMode.
