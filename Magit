Had to change magit-escape-for-shell to:

  (defun magit-escape-for-shell (str)
    (if (or (string= str "git")
        (string-match "^--" str))
          str
        (concat "'" (replace-regexp-in-string "'" "'\\''" str) "'")))

To make it work on windows. -- RodrigoWanderley

mo-git-blame is a great addition as a frontend for git blame (which magit currently does not provide)
