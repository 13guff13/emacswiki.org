== Crash Course ==

Getting started with Magit is really easy:
 
* M-x magit-status to see git status, and in the status buffer:
* s to stage files
* c c to commit (type in your commit message then C-c C-c to save the message and commit)
* b b to switch to a branch

Other handy keys:

* P P to do a git push
* F F to do a git pull
* try to press TAB

== Auto updating the status buffer ==

If you are using Emacs 24.4 with `file-notify-support' you can use the minor mode `magit-filenotify' from [https://github.com/magit/magit-filenotify/blob/master/magit-filenotify.el magit-filenotify.el] which tracks changes in the source tree using `file-notify' and refreshes the magit status buffer.
