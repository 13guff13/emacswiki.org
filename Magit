Magit is an emacs mode for interacting with the [[Git]] version control system. It's written by MariusVollmer, of GNU/Guile fame. PhilJackson took over as maintainer for quite some time, and now Magit is collectively maintained by YannHodique, RemiVanicat and PeterWeisberg.

* Get it from: http://magit.github.com/magit/
* Bugs to project page on github: http://github.com/magit/magit/issues
* Manual: http://magit.github.com/magit/magit.html

== Crash Course ==

Getting started with Magit is really easy:
 
* M-x magit-status to see git status, and in the status buffer:
* s to stage files
* c to commit (type in your commit message then C-c C-c to save the message and commit)
* b b to switch to a branch

Other handy keys:

* P P to do a git push
* F F to do a git pull
* try to press TAB

After you are hooked check the info manual, it's not that big.

== TRAMP ==
Version 0.7 (March 2009) of Magit (the version in Debian Squeeze) didn't support TRAMP. Somewhere between there and 1.0 (March 2011) TRAMP support was added. February-August 2009 Ian Eure maintained a [http://atomized.org/2009/01/forked-magit-that-works-with-tramp/ fork] ([https://github.com/ieure/magit github]) that added support for TRAMP. Since more recent versions of the official Magit, you should use that. You still see some references to Ian's version around the net, they can be ignored.

=== Tramp under windows ===

Had to change magit-escape-for-shell to:

  (defun magit-escape-for-shell (str)
    (if (or (string= str "git")
        (string-match "^--" str))
          str
        (concat "'" (replace-regexp-in-string "'" "'\\''" str) "'")))

To make it work on windows. -- RodrigoWanderley

== mo-git-blame == 
mo-git-blame is a great addition as a frontend for git blame (which magit currently does not provide)

== Removing Highlights on Diff mode==
[new:MarcoCraveiro:dt Feb  08 10:26:37 GMT 2010]
Don't really like the highlights on diff mode... Made it optional using:

  (defcustom magit-use-highlights nil
       "Use highlights in diff buffer."
       :group 'magit
       :type 'boolean)

And then changed magit-highlight-section as follows:

 (defun magit-highlight-section ()
    (let ((section (magit-current-section)))
      -    (when (not (eq section magit-highlighted-section))
      +    (when (and (not (eq section magit-highlighted-section))
      +                    magit-use-highlights)
