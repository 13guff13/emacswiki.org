Magit is an emacs mode for interacting with the [[Git]] version control system. It's written by MariusVollmer, of GNU/Guile fame. Recently PhilJackson, of no particular fame, took over as maintainer.

Had to change magit-escape-for-shell to:

  (defun magit-escape-for-shell (str)
    (if (or (string= str "git")
        (string-match "^--" str))
          str
        (concat "'" (replace-regexp-in-string "'" "'\\''" str) "'")))

To make it work on windows. -- RodrigoWanderley

mo-git-blame is a great addition as a frontend for git blame (which magit currently does not provide)

Don't really like the highlights on diff mode... Made it optional using:

  (defcustom magit-use-highlights nil
       "Use highlights in diff buffer."
       :group 'magit
       :type 'boolean)

And then changed magit-highlight-section as follows:

 (defun magit-highlight-section ()
    (let ((section (magit-current-section)))
      -    (when (not (eq section magit-highlighted-section))
      +    (when (and (not (eq section magit-highlighted-section))
      +                    magit-use-highlights)

There's a fork of Magit with TRAMP support to work remotely: http://atomized.org/2009/01/forked-magit-that-works-with-tramp/
