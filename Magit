Magit is an interface to the version control system [https://git-scm.com Git],
implemented as an [https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs Emacs] package.
Magit aspires to be a complete Git porcelain.  While we cannot (yet)
claim that Magit wraps and improves upon each and every Git command,
it is complete enough to allow even experienced Git users to perform
almost all of their daily version control tasks directly from within
Emacs.  While many fine Git clients exist, only Magit and Git itself
deserve to be called porcelains.  [https://magit.vc/about.html (more)]
