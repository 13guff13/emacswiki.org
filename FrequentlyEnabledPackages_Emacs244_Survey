As part of Emacs-24.4 release,  [[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.devel/165883</nobr> emacs-devel is conducting a survey]].  We want to find out  packages/modes that you enable by default.

__Interesting Titbit__

Based on popular demand,   [[http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.devel/166061  Uniquify will be enabled by default]] in Emacs-24.4

__How to Vote__

# Increment __Number of People surveyed__
# If you use a package that is in the list, upvote it by incrementing its vote by 1.
# If you use a package that is not in the list, please add to the table below. The first column is sorted in alphabetical order.


__Things to Remember (Things to avoid) __

# Speak for yourself (not your friends).  Always increment the upvote by one.
# Don't downvote
# Add new entries at appropriate place.  Tables is sorted alphabetically on Column-1.  (Only add entries for minor-modes you actually use!)
# C-h f on that entry should work  (i.e., Use ido-mode instead of saying ido).  This avoids use of multiple names to point to the same package.
# '''No Third-Party packages.''' -- specify only packages that ship with Vanilla GNU Emacs
# Give preference to minor modes (that you enable globally)
# Optionally participate in the Major mode/Derived mode survey.

__How to keep the Table sorted__

The table is in Org-mode format.  If you add lots of packages, here is a recipe to keep the table sorted.

# Copy the table to *scratch* buffer.
# M-x orgtbl-mode
# With cursor on the table, C-c C-c
# Put your cursor on Column-1 and do M-x org-table-sort-lines. Choose [a] alphabetic when prompted.
# Copy back the table here.
