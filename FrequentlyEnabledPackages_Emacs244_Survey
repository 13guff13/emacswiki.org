As part of Emacs-24.4 release, emacs-devel is conducting a survey.  We want to find out  packages/modes that are enabled by you by default in Vanilla Emacs.

__Interesting Titbit__

Based on popular demand,   [[http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.devel/166061  Uniquify will be enabled by default]] in Emacs-24.4

__How to Vote__

# If you use a package that is in the list, please upvote it by incrementing its vote by 1.  
# If you use a package that is not in the list, please add to the table below. The first column is sorted in alphabetical order.  

__How to keep the Table sorted__

The table is in Org-mode format.  If you add lots of packages, here is a recipe to keep the table sorted.

# Copy the table to *scratch* buffer.
# M-x orgtbl-mode
# With cursor on the table, C-c C-c
# Put your cursor on Column-1 and do M-x org-table-sort-lines. Choose [a] alphabetic when prompted.
# Copy back the table here.

__Guidelines__

# Avoid mentioning big packages like Gnus, Org ec.  Global minor modes are good candidates to plug in to this list.. The intention is here to collect information on packages that are useful for ALL users.  


# If you want to qualify your vote with an extra comment, please add it to the Talk page.

# No Third-Party packages.  Please mention libraries that are part of Gnu Emacs only.
