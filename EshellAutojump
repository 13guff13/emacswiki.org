This is an eshell extension to facilitate directory switching.

* Lisp:eshell-autojump.el

Use `j' to list your favorite directories (as determined by your usage of `cd').
Use `j regexp' to jump to your most favorite directory matching the regular expression.

Your favorite directories are saved in `~/.eshell/autojump'.

Instead of measuring how much time you spend in a particular directory, I just measure how often you switch /to/ a particular directory.
The code hooks into `eshell-directory-change-hook'.

Note that the *standard eshell comes with a very similar mechanism*: it maintains a ring the last 32 directories seen.

: To view the ring: `cd ='
: Changing to an index within the ring: `cd -4'
: Note that `cd -' is the same as `cd -0'
: Use a regular expression: `cd =regexp'

The ring is saved in `~/.eshell/lastdir'. You can increase the ring size by setting `eshell-last-dir-ring-size'. Perhaps this is good enough for you, making autojump unnecessary. The only benefit autojump offers is that it sorts the entries by /how often/ you switched there instead of /when/ you switched there.

Here's how I installed it in my ~/.emacs file:

{{{
(eval-after-load 'eshell
  '(require 'eshell-autojump nil t))
}}}
