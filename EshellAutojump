This is an eshell extension to facilitate directory switching.

* Lisp:eshell-autojump.el

Use `j' to list your favorite directories (as determined by your usage of `cd').
Use `j regexp' to jump to your most favorite directory matching the regular expression.

Your favorite directories are saved in `~/.eshell/autojump'.

Instead of measuring how much time you spend in a particular directory, I just measure how often you switch /to/ a particular directory.
The code hooks into `eshell-directory-change-hook'.
