This is a mode for IBM Universe Uni BASIC. Originally coded by Pat Thoyt. 
Minor revision by Norman Bauer. I wish to publicly thank Pat Thoyt for codeing this, I would be even more stressed out had I had to keep on using the Uni Basic editor or even worse Eclipse. Thank you for this gift I use every day.
