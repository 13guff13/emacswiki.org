Inspired by zap-to-char, this library defines different routines operating on the next/previous N'th occurrence of a character.  When invoking one of these commands, the user is interactively queried for a character while the potential target positions are highlighted.

For example, META-s (jump-to-char-forward) highlights the next occurrences of each character and prompts for one.  Once the user picks a char, the point is moved to that position.  Subsequent invocations of META-s before picking a character increases N, that is, the second, third, etc. occurrences are highlighted and targeted.

The sprint-forward/backward commands apply iterative jumping until return/C-G is hit, making it possible to reach any point of the text with just a few keystrokes.

To use it, simply put Lisp:fastnav.el under <tt>~/.emacs.d/</tt>, and add something like this to your emacs initialization file:

    (require 'fastnav)

    (global-set-key "\M-z" 'zap-up-to-char-forward)
    (global-set-key "\M-Z" 'zap-up-to-char-backward)
    (global-set-key "\M-s" 'jump-to-char-forward)
    (global-set-key "\M-S" 'jump-to-char-backward)
    (global-set-key "\M-r" 'replace-char-forward)
    (global-set-key "\M-R" 'replace-char-backward)
    (global-set-key "\M-i" 'insert-at-char-forward)
    (global-set-key "\M-I" 'insert-at-char-backward)
    (global-set-key "\M-j" 'execute-at-char-forward)
    (global-set-key "\M-J" 'execute-at-char-backward)
    (global-set-key "\M-k" 'delete-char-forward)
    (global-set-key "\M-K" 'delete-char-backward)
    (global-set-key "\M-m" 'mark-to-char-forward)
    (global-set-key "\M-M" 'mark-to-char-backward)

    (global-set-key "\M-p" 'sprint-forward)
    (global-set-key "\M-P" 'sprint-backward)

Below is an screenshot showing how the first occurences of each character are highlighted:

Nice. Is it possible to add memory to this thing? Like, '##M-s RET##' jumps forward to the character previously entered.

I don't see the point. Why cannot you just hit '##M-s x##' if x is the character previously entered?

I love it! But it fails for me on "org-mode" buffers. It doesn't do anything when I enter the char (it aborts). I don't see any error on *Messages*. Any ideas? -- ferd

Fixed. Sorry for the confusion. -- Zsolt

I like the idea. You should prefix your functions with fastnav- to avoid polluting the global namespace.

Amúgy szép munka. ;)
