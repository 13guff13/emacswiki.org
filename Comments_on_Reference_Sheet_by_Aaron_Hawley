It is ''not'' true that `C-x C-v RET' is the same as `revert-buffer'.
See [[RevertBuffer#C-xC-vRETisNOTrevert-buffer|C-x C-v is not revert-buffer]].

Besides the Dired scenario, I can't find a reason to really care.

That doesn't surprise me.

What is true of `revert-buffer' in Dired is true in general.

* `revert-buffer' is a different command from `find-alternate-file'.  They are not defined to do the same thing.  Look at their code, if you want to understand this.

* `revert-buffer' applies to buffers other than just file buffers -- Dired is only one example of this.  See the doc for `revert-buffer'.
