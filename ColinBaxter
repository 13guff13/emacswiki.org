== About ==
I am a physicist based in the UK - my [[http://www.colin-baxter.com/|web-page]] gives details of my research. I am ocasionally found at the  [[IRC]] channel #emacs under the nickname of  [::m43cap].

== My Relationship with Emacs ==
I came to Emacs late in life, after using just about every rubbish editor and word-processor known to mankind. Beginning with AUCTeX and using Emacs as a writing tool, I have, over several years, gradually moved to adopting Emacs as my default application for command-line work, (AnsiTerm), file management (DiredMode), email, Internet browser (WThreeM), a universal organiser (OrgMode), etc., etc. The abandonment of most other applications has wonderfully removed desktop clutter. I do not do very much programming these days, except the occasional perl (PerlDevelopEnvironment) and fortran (FortranMode).

== Emacs Projects ==
# Even though it is byte-compiled, my init-file is far too long. I am working on moving to a modular form of Emacs initialisation.
# I am incorporating a cgi Perl script to link my Emacs database (EmacsDataBase) to a web-page.
