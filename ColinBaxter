== About ==
I'm a physicist based in the UK - my [[http://www.colin-baxter.com/|web-page]] gives details of my research.

== Emacs and me ==
Beginning with AUCTeX and using Emacs as a writing tool, I have, over several years, gradually moving to adopting Emacs as my default application for command-line work, file management, emailer, browser, organiser, etc., etc. The abandonment of most other applications has wonderfully removed desktop clutter.

== Contributions to EmacsWiki ==
# Perl Development Environment (pde) - [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Comments_on_PerlDevelopEnvironment|Beware of Sytem-Wide Installation]]

== Emacs Projects ==
# Even though it is byte-compiled, my init-file is far too long. I am working on moving to a modular form of Emacs initialisation.
# I am incorporating a cgi Perl script to link my Emacs database (edb) to a web-page.
