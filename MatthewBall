I am an Australian university student studying philosophy/linguistics.

I have been using GNU Emacs for the past five or so years, currently using GNU Emacs 24. I run Debian Squeeze with StumpWM.

I'm not much of a programmer, my interest in GNU Emacs is primarily focused on how it can be used as a writing environment.

I spend a fair amount of time idling in #emacs on freenode under the nickname "[::chu]".

- GNU Emacs for Writing
Roughly, the tasks GNU Emacs easily accommodates which are of interest to myself can be classified as follows:
1. Notes and Authoring
2. Dictionary and Thesaurus
3. Reference and Bibliography
