== Introduction ==

I am an Australian university student studying philosophy/linguistics.

I'm not much of a programmer, my interest in GNU Emacs is primarily focused on how it can be used as a writing environment.

I spend a fair amount of time idling in #emacs on freenode under the nickname "[::chu]".

== GNU Emacs ==
I have been using GNU Emacs for the past five or so years, currently using GNU Emacs 24. I run Debian Squeeze with StumpWM.

Roughly, the tasks GNU Emacs easily accommodates which are of interest to myself can be classified as follows:
==== Notes and Authoring ====
For notes and authoring, I have found the following to be useful:
* deft
* org-mode

==== Dictionary and Thesaurus ====
For dictionary and thesaurus purposes I have found the following to be useful:
* dictem
* thesaurus

==== Reference and Bibliography ====
For references and bibliography I have found the following to be useful:
* bibtex
* ebib
