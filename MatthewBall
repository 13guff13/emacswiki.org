== Introduction ==
I am an Australian university student studying philosophy/linguistics.

I'm not much of a programmer, my interest in (GNU) Emacs is primarily focused on how it can be used as a writing environment.

== GNU Emacs ==
I have been using GNU Emacs for the past five or so years, and am currently using [http://emacs.naquadah.org/|GNU Emacs 24]. I'm absolutely in love with [[package.el]] and [[ELPA]] for GNU Emacs 24, and have attempted to automatically handle as much configuration as possible using it. I have a small, lightweight, netbook running [http://wiki.debian.org/DebianSqueeze|Debian Squeeze] with StumpWM, GNU Emacs, and Chromium web-browser, which is ideal for my needs. Despite this, I'm not much of a "minimalist" - I've never been a terminal user for instance - a GNU Emacs session for me is, I would say, relatively "heavy". I use the following GNU Emacs modes extensively:

* [[Ido]]
* [[Smex]]
* [[IbufferMode]]
* [[ERC]]
* [[Gnus]]
* [[DiredMode]]
* [[AnsiTerm]]
* [[DeskTop]]
* [[RecentFiles]]
* [[AutoComplete]]
* [[ELPA]]
* [[DiminishedModes]]
* [[VisualLineMode]]
* [[AdaptiveWrapMode]] (see: [[LineWrap]])

== Writing ==
Roughly, the tasks GNU Emacs easily accommodates which are of interest to myself can be classified as follows:

=== 1. Notes and Authoring ===
For notes and authoring I have found the following to be useful:
* [[DeftMode]]
* [[OrgMode]]

=== 2. Dictionary, Spelling and Thesaurus ===
For dictionary, spelling and thesaurus purposes I have found the following to be useful:
* [[DictEm]]
* [[FlySpell]]
* [[thesaurus.el]]

=== 3. References and Bibliography ===
For references and bibliography I have found the following to be useful:
* [[BibTeX]]
* [[RefTeX]]
* [http://ebib.sourceforge.net/ ebib]

== StumpWM ==
Spend some time with GNU Emacs and the user is invited to learn EmacsLisp. I enjoyed EmacsLisp so much I started looking into other lisps, finding CommonLisp and StumpWM.

I've been using StumpWM for a few years and find it to be the best window manager for my purposes - which is really just an instance of GNU Emacs and an instance of Chromium.

== Configuration ==
I will get around to cleaning up my dot emacs file and putting it online eventually.

== Contact ==
I can be reached via email at "mathew.ball" at "gmail.com".

I spend a fair amount of time idling in [[EmacsChannel|#emacs]], #stumpwm, #org-mode, and various other channels on freenode under the nickname "[::chu]".
