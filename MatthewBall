I am an Australian university student studying philosophy/linguistics.

I have been using GNU Emacs for the past five or so years, currently using GNU Emacs 24.

I'm not much of a programmer, my interest in GNU Emacs is primarily focused on how it can be used as a writing environment.

I spend a fair amount of time idling in #emacs on freenode under the nickname "chu".
