== Introduction ==

I am an Australian university student studying philosophy/linguistics.

I'm not much of a programmer, my interest in GNU Emacs is primarily focused on how it can be used as a writing environment.

I spend a fair amount of time idling in [[EmacsChannel|#emacs]], #stumpwm, #org-mode and various other channels on freenode under the nickname "[::chu]".


== GNU Emacs ==
I have been using GNU Emacs for the past five or so years, currently using GNU Emacs 24. I run Debian Squeeze with StumpWM.

I'm interested in somehow //giving back// to the (GNU) Emacs community - though I cannot code, I can at the very least write documentation, one day I will upload some of the (personal) stuff I have written about GNU Emacs.

I use the following GNU Emacs modes extensively:
* [[Ido]]
* [[Smex]]
* [[ERC]]
* [[Gnus]]
* [[DiredMode]]
* [[AnsiTerm]]

Roughly, the tasks GNU Emacs easily accommodates which are of interest to myself (and I would say "writers in general" but I don't want to talk on behalf of *all* writers) can be classified as follows:

=== Notes and Authoring ===
For notes and authoring I have found the following to be useful:
* [[DeftMode]]
* [[OrgMode]]

=== Dictionary and Thesaurus ===
For dictionary and thesaurus purposes I have found the following to be useful:
* [[DictEm]]
* [[thesaurus.el]]

=== References and Bibliography ===
For references and bibliography I have found the following to be useful:
* [[BibTeX]]
* [[RefTeX]]
* [http://ebib.sourceforge.net/ ebib]

== StumpWM ==
Spend some time with GNU Emacs and the user is invited to learn emacs lisp. I enjoyed emacs lisp so much I started looking into other lisps, finding common lisp and stumpwm.

I've been using StumpWM for a few years and find it to be the best window manager for my purposes - which is really just an instance of GNU Emacs and an instance of Chromium.

== Configuration ==
I will get around to cleaning up my dot emacs file and putting it online eventually.

== Contact ==
I can be contacted by email at "mathew.ball at gmail.com".
