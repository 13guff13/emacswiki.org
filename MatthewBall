== Introduction ==

I am an Australian university student studying philosophy/linguistics.

I'm not much of a programmer, my interest in GNU Emacs is primarily focused on how it can be used as a writing environment.

I spend a fair amount of time idling in #emacs on freenode under the nickname "[::chu]".

== GNU Emacs ==
I have been using GNU Emacs for the past five or so years, currently using GNU Emacs 24. I run Debian Squeeze with StumpWM.

Roughly, the tasks GNU Emacs easily accommodates which are of interest to myself can be classified as follows:
=== Notes and Authoring ===
For notes and authoring, I have found the following to be useful:
* [[DeftMode]]
* [[OrgMode]]

=== Dictionary and Thesaurus ===
For dictionary and thesaurus purposes I have found the following to be useful:
* [[DictEm]]
* [[thesaurus.el]]

=== Reference and Bibliography ===
For references and bibliography I have found the following to be useful:
* [[BibTeX]]
* [http://ebib.sourceforge.net/ ebib]

== StumpWM ==
Spend some time with GNU Emacs and the user is invited to learn emacs lisp. I enjoyed emacs lisp so much I started looking into other lisps, finding common lisp and stumpwm.

I've been using StumpWM for a few years and find it to be the best window manager for my purposes - which is really just an instance of GNU Emacs and an instance of Chromium.

== Configuration ==
I will get around to cleaning up my dot emacs file and putting it online eventually.
