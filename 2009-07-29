Please note that the stupid [http://www.emacswiki.org/alex/2009-07-29_Best_Essays_Spam Best Essays] link spam has reached Emacs Wiki.
These guys try to hide their nefarious spam using apparently legitimate usernames, rollbacks, and links to the old revisions.
The stupid spammers don't know that the spammed revisions will expire within two weeks, so the net result is that they're
vandalising the wiki.

You might consider watching [Self:action=rc;showedit=1;rollback=1 RecentChanges including minor edits and rollbacks] if you want to help
revert this vandalism. The edits I've looked at today all seemed to come from the IP number 119.111.124.194.
