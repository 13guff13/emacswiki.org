[::CEDET]
is a collection of tools written with the end goal of creating
an advanced development environment.  Emacs already is a great
environment for writing software, but there are additional areas that
need improvement. Many new ideas for integrated environments have been
developed in newer products, such as Microsoft's Visual Studio
environment. CEDET is a new project which brings together the various
tools built to replicate these features.

The CEDET home page is http://cedet.sourceforge.net/.

CEDET has changed very much and the development version is the preferred version to use.
Bugs are mostly fixed rapidly by EricLudlam.

To get the development version easily and set it up you can use [NxhtmlMode nXhtml] which has a tool for this in the nXhtml menus (see nXhtml / Tools / CEDET).

Another component of CEDET is "Senator". Someone with better knowledge should delete this section and put description of Senator in the appropriate place.

Here's a description of one function Senator provides and it's use:
