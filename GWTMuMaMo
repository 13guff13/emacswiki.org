[http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/ Google Web Toolkit] code is essentially Java code that will be compiled
to JavaScript by the GWT compiler. It is also possible to write inline
JavaScript (JSNI), and this mode uses nXhtml's MuMaMo to provide support
for both Java and JavaScript in the same file.

In order to use gwt-mumamo, you will need the following:
* nXhtml (http://ourcomments.org/Emacs/nXhtml/doc/nxhtml.html)
* espresso-mode (http://www.nongnu.org/espresso/

You can get gwt-mumamo here:
Lisp:gwt-mumamo.el
