I use Emacs.

== Programs I wrote ==

* [ScimBridge scim-bridge.el] -- SCIM-Bridge client for GNU Emacs.
* [RedoPlus redo+.el] -- a fork of redo.el which can correctly work in newer version of Emacs
* [PosTip pos-tip.el] -- a library for easily showing tooltip at arbitrary buffer position
* [TransEJ trans-ej.el] -- English-Japanese translator using multiple Web translation services
* [MenuTree menu-tree.el] -- Localize menu-bar items (Originally written by YAGI Tatsuya)
* etc.

== Web sites I maintain ==

* [http://www11.atwiki.jp/s-irie/ Home Page (in Japanese)]
* [http://d.hatena.ne.jp/iRiE/ Blog (in Japanese)]
* [https://launchpad.net/~irie Launchpad] ([https://launchpad.net/~irie/+archive/elisp PPA])
