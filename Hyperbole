From its documentation:

: //Hyperbole (pronounced Hi-per-bo-lee) is an open, efficient, and programmable hypertextual information management and outliner system.//

The project page is http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/hyperbole/. The development work has recently (2016) started again with the goal of having a new release some time during the summer.

Hyperbole has the follwing features:
 
* Info Management: an interactive, unstructured textual information management interface.
* Screen Control: fast and easiest-to-use window and frame control. 
* KoutlineMode: advanced outliner with multi-level autonumbering.
* Button Types: set of hyper-button types which supply core hypertext and other behaviors.
* Programming Library: library classes for system developers who want to integrate with Hyperbole.

I would like to see a comparison between the various Information Management tools and [[Hyperbole]].  Could anyone comment on this?

[new]
Am I right if I assume that the major components of Hyperbole are something similar to outline minor mode + the ability to create links to different places (a position in a file for example)?

In that case I think that OrgMode can do the same things very good. And that already comes with Emacs 22.
