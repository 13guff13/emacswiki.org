It is very convenient to have BBDB notice when an email arrives from a person whose name it already knows, but using an email address that it has not seen before. In these circumstances, it consults `bbdb-always-add-addresses' to determine whether it should auto-add the address, prompt the user, or ignore the similarity. I usually have this set to ##'ask##.
