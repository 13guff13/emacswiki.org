ClojureMode is a major mode that provides font-lock, indentation, and functions for communication with subprocesses for [http://clojure.org Clojure].

It's more useful if used together with swank-clojure to interact with subprocesses. See http://technomancy.us/126 for a tutorial.

Please note that http://github.com/jochu/clojure-mode is outdated and not actively developed although it is found on many websites.  

Depending on the version of Clojure you use you may need to use a different branch.  See also [http://www.skamphausen.de/cgi-bin/ska/My_Clojure_Setup A manual setup] for old time Emacsers and SBCL-users.
