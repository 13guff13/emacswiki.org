This pages has links to reference material and will eventually explain
the BiDi machinery in the works for Emacs and XEmacs.

== Current Status ==

Neither Emacs 21 nor XEmacs 21 do bidi well at the moment.  "bidi" refers
to the input and output of bidirectional text.  This is important when
right-to-left scripts such as Arabic and Hebrew are mixed with
left-to-right scripts such as European langauges.

There is a branch of Emacs 21 available for Arabic and Hebrew by the
National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology
(AIST)!  It is based on the GNU Emacs-21.3.50 branch and available from here:

* http://www.m17n.org/emacs-bidi/index.html

It is possible to actually get BiDi work done under XEmacs 21.5; see

* http://mid.gmane.org/18303.36755.595764.653413@parhasard.net

Requires a terminal emulator with support for bidi, for example PuTTY or mlterm(1). This is not a particularly satisfactory solution. 

Poor-mans-bidi-mode takes a different - in-the-mean-time - approach: it  
an external program such as fribidi or bidiv to display the bidified text 
in a different buffer, relocating point by context, so that you know where you are; see

* Lisp:poor-mans-bidi.el

"Unified and Extensible Mechanism for Multilingual Text Processing" by
KenichiHanda, MikikoNishikimi, SatoruTomura, and NaotoTakahashi,
available in various translations, explains the MULE basics:

You can find more information on the Unicode homepage:

* http://www.unicode.org/

The most important Technical Report in this context is Report #9, also
known as <i>Unicode Standard Annex #9</i>, or UAX#9, subtitled <i>The
Bidirectional Algorithm</i>.

* http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr9/

The bidi algorithm needs to know the bidi types for all categories.
These can be extracted from one of the data files available from
Unicode.  See the <nowiki>UnicodeData.txt</nowiki> file at the
following location for the bidi types, see the
<nowiki>BidiMirroring.txt</nowiki> file for the mirroring of glyphs.
