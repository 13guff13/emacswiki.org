This pages has links to reference material and will eventually explain
the "bidi" machinery in the works for Emacs and XEmacs.

== Current Status ==

Emacs supports bidirectional display out of the box since version 24.1.  Just type in text in a R2L script such as hebrew or arabic.
Emacs 24.4 and later supports visual-order cursor motion, as an optional feature; the default is still to use logical-order cursor
movement.
Starting with Emacs 25.1 (yet unreleased as of this writing, but available from the Emacs source repository), the new isolate
controls introduced by Unicode 6.3 are fully supported.

== Older Bidi Support ==

Neither Emacs 21 nor XEmacs 21 do bidi well at the moment.  "bidi" refers
to the input and output of bidirectional text.  This is important when
right-to-left scripts such as Arabic and Hebrew are mixed with
left-to-right scripts such as European langauges.

There is a branch of Emacs 21 available for Arabic and Hebrew by the
National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology
(AIST)!  It is based on the GNU Emacs-21.3.50 branch and available from here:

* http://www.m17n.org/emacs-bidi/index.html

It is possible to actually get bidi work done under XEmacs 21.5; see

* http://mid.gmane.org/18303.36755.595764.653413@parhasard.net

Requires a terminal emulator with support for bidi, for example PuTTY or mlterm(1). This is not a particularly satisfactory solution. 

Poor-mans-bidi-mode takes a different - in-the-mean-time - approach: it  
an external program such as fribidi or bidiv to display the bidified text 
in a different buffer, relocating point by context, so that you know where you are; see

* Lisp:poor-mans-bidi.el

"Unified and Extensible Mechanism for Multilingual Text Processing" by
KenichiHanda, MikikoNishikimi, SatoruTomura, and NaotoTakahashi,
available in various translations, explains the MULE basics:

You can find more information on the Unicode homepage:

The most important Technical Report in this context is Report #9, also
known as <i>Unicode Standard Annex #9</i>, or UAX#9, subtitled <i>The
Bidirectional Algorithm</i>.

* http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr9/

The bidi algorithm needs to know the bidi types for all categories.
These can be extracted from one of the data files available from
Unicode.  See the <nowiki>UnicodeData.txt</nowiki> file at the
following location for the bidi types, see the
<nowiki>BidiMirroring.txt</nowiki> file for the mirroring of glyphs.
