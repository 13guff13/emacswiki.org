Emacs supports bidirectional display out of the box since version 24.1.  Just type in text in a R2L script such as Hebrew or Arabic.
Emacs 24.4 and later supports visual-order cursor motion, as an optional feature; the default is still to use logical-order cursor
movement.
Starting with Emacs 25.1 (yet unreleased as of this writing, but available from the Emacs source repository), the new isolate
controls introduced by Unicode 6.3 are fully supported.

The most important Technical Report in this context is Report #9, also
known as <i>Unicode Standard Annex #9</i>, or UAX#9, subtitled <i>The
Bidirectional Algorithm</i>.

The bidi algorithm needs to know the bidi types for all categories.
These can be extracted from one of the data files available from
Unicode.  See the <nowiki>UnicodeData.txt</nowiki> file at the
following location for the bidi types, see the
<nowiki>BidiMirroring.txt</nowiki> file for the mirroring of glyphs.
