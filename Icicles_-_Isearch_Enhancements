== Isearch Enhancements ==

'''Icicles''' provides two different enhancements for searching:

* '''Icicles''' search: Top-level '''Icicles''' [[command]]s that provide an entirely
new and different way for you to search.  This is described in [[Icicles - Search Commands, Overview]].

* Extensions to standard Emacs incremental search, '''[[Isearch]]'''.  These are
described here.

** Search string [[completion]] against previous search strings.
** OccurMode interface for Isearch hits.
** '''Icicles''' search (`icicle-search') interface, reusing the Isearch search string (by default).

'''See Also:''' [[Icicles - Support for Projects]] for information about using `grep' to search all of the files in a project.



[:SearchStringCompletion]
=== Isearch Completion Against the Search History ===

When you search incrementally (`C-s'), Emacs lets
you use `M-TAB' (aka `C-M-i', aka `ESC-TAB') to complete your input to a string that you have sought
previously, that is, a string in the current search history
(`search-ring' or `regexp-search-ring').  In ''Icicle'' mode, this feature is enhanced so that you
can use all of the completion enhancements provided by '''Icicles''': `M-TAB' is bound to `icicle-isearch-complete' during Isearch.

On MS Windows, the operating system itself grabs `M-TAB' (by default), making it
unavailable for Emacs.  For this reason, on Windows, '''Icicles''' binds `icicle-isearch-complete' also to 
'''`C-M-TAB''''.  But note that
you can also use '''##(w32-register-hot-key [M-tab])##''' to enable Emacs to
use `M-TAB'.

'''Icicles''' users are in the habit of using '''`<tt>[[Icicles - History Enhancements#M-o|M-o]]</tt>'''' to complete the
current minibuffer input against previously entered inputs.
Because of the similarity, you can likewise use `M-o' during
Isearch to complete the current search string: '''`M-o'''' is equivalent
to `M-TAB'.

The keys bound by default to `icicle-isearch-complete' in
`isearch-mode-map' are thus `M-o' and `M-TAB' (and `C-M-TAB' on MS
Windows).  But you can change the keys to use for this by
[[Customize|customizing]] [[option]] '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-isearch-complete-keys|icicle-isearch-complete-keys]]</tt>''''.

When you use `M-o' (or `M-TAB') while searching, Isearch exits momentarily,
giving way to '''Icicles''' completion in the [[minibuffer]] (Isearch
actually uses the [[echo area]], not the minibuffer).  You can then
use either `S-TAB' or `TAB' to complete your search string.  After
you finish completing (e.g. by hitting `RET'), Isearch resumes
with the new, completed search string.  It's pretty seamless, and
easier to try than to describe.

''Reminder:'' Using `S-TAB' vs `TAB' for [[regexp]] vs
non-regexp ''completion'' against
previous search strings has nothing to do with regexp vs
non-regexp ''searching''.  You can of course use either kind of
searching before or after having used either kind of completion.
Isearch uses different [[search ring]]s for regexp and non-regexp
searching.  The kind of search in progress (regexp or not) at the
moment you ask Isearch for completion determines which search ring
provides the candidates for completion.


[:OccurFromIsearch]
=== Launch Occur using the Isearch Search String ===

If you use library <tt>[[color-moccur.el]]</tt> or library <tt>[[occur-schroeder.el]]</tt>, then '''`C-o'''' is bound
during Isearch to `isearch-moccur', which provides an OccurMode buffer
interface for search hits.  This has nothing per se to do with
'''Icicles''', but you might find it useful.  (Library ##color-moccur.el##
itself binds `M-o' for this, but `<tt>[[Icicles - History Enhancements#M-o|M-o]]</tt>' is used in '''Icicles''' for
search-string completion.)


[:IciclesSearchFromIsearch]
=== Launch Icicles Search using the Isearch Search String ===

'''Icicles''' search is described in section [[Icicles - Search Commands, Overview]].

You can start '''Icicles''' search from Isearch: Hit `S-TAB' to choose
the Icicles search initial regexp -- the default value is the
current Isearch search string, but you can edit that.  Completion
is available for your input -- completion against your previous
Isearch regexp search strings.

For example, use `##C-s C-w C-w S-TAB##' to pick up the next two words
at the cursor, then type `##.*##' before and after them and hit `RET'.
That puts you in '''Icicles''' search with the completion candidates
being all of the lines in the buffer that contain that two-word
phrase.  Type some more text to narrow the candidate lines to
those that match what you type.  Then use `C-next' to visit search
hits.

The key to initiate '''Icicles''' search from Isearch is `S-TAB' only by
default.  You can change this key by customizing option '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-search-from-isearch-keys|icicle-search-from-isearch-keys]]</tt>''''.
