This page says:

"If Tramp still isn’t fast enough for you (or if you don’t use linux), try http://linux.com/feature/54498"...

But, that link is 404.

Here is the original: http://web.archive.org/web/20090227075027/http://www.linux.com/feature/54498
Title: "Accelerating OpenSSH connections with ControlMaster"

...I did not easily find a good replacement article.

I use Tramp Mode under Linux all the time.

You need a full PuTTY suite, with the plink utility for the interface.

In addition to editing files on a remote pc and with the ability to do more work on the road using my smartphone, I found myself editing files that I have stored online more and more. I know this is a different type of file editing but I thought this info on how to store files online might be useful because in addition to backing up files simple and safely, I like the ability to access my files wherever I am.
