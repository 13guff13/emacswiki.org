This page says:

"If Tramp still isn’t fast enough for you (or if you don’t use linux), try http://linux.com/feature/54498"...

But, that link is 404.

Here is the original: http://web.archive.org/web/20090227075027/http://www.linux.com/feature/54498
Title: "Accelerating OpenSSH connections with ControlMaster"

...I did not easily find a good replacement article.

I use Tramp Mode under Linux all the time.

You need a full PuTTY suite, with the plink utility for the interface.
