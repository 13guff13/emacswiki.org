[[ja:Wikiのダウンロード]]
Here is how to download the wiki:

* DownloadPartOfWiki -- download a small part of Emacs Wiki, using `wget'. Tricky.

* [[SVN repository]] of the raw EmacsWiki pages. This repository is read-only. Great for grepping.

* [[CVS repository]] of the elisp files uploaded to this wiki. This repository is read-only. Great for source files only.

* [[Rsync repository]] -- help making decentralized backups of the entire setup. Great for mirrors, forks, and the like.

* [[Git repository]] of the raw EmacsWiki pages.  Also contains branches with only subsets of all pages but still full history.
