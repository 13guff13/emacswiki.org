To connect to password protected servers you need to store authentication information in one of these files:

; ##~/.authinfo.gpg##: encrypted (use this!)
; ##~/.authinfo##: not encrypted
; ##~/.netrc##: the old format

Thus, simply save your information in ##~/.authinfo.gpg## and you're done.

Create it with only read-write rights for the user:

    touch ~/.authinfo
    chmod 600 ~/.authinfo

Add a line for each user like this:

    machine HOST login NAME password VALUE port NUMBER

i.e. in following example from John Doe's ~/.authinfo:

    machine imap.gmail.com login john_doe@gmail.com password notapassword port 993

== Different Files for Different Server Methods ==

You can use different authinfo files for different server methods. For example use this variable:

<code>nntp-authinfo-file</code> for setting the nntp authinfo file

<code>nnimap-authinfo-file</code> for setting the nnimap authinfo file

<code>smtpmail-auth-credentials</code> for setting the smtpmail authinfo file

== Connecting to another Box on an Exchange Server ==

Using the nnimap backend you can connect to another box by giving the domain, username and boxname explicitly:

    machine <mailserver> login "<domain>/<username>/<boxname>" password "secret"
