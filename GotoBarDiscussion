The line of links at the top and at the bottom starting with SiteMap or its equivalent if you're browsing in another language is called the goto bar.  It is a minimal list of important links.  To complement the user with more useful links would be to have a community-editable sidebar page.  See the [http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/test Test Wiki] or the CommunityWiki for an example.

The current existince and order of the links in the goto bar are based on the following reasons:

* SiteMap and [[Search]] are top-level navigation aids.
* ElispArea, like SiteMap and [[Search]], is a prominent part of the site and getting code is a common task of the site.
* SiteMap, [[Search]], ElispArea, and HowTo are all things that newbies will look for; the rest is more for wiki junkies. 
* [[News]] and RecentChanges should be next to each other.

XML and TXT buttons used to be in the goto bar, but are now appear as just text links on RecentChanges.  The two most recent days for the [[News]] blog also existed in the goto bar, but more often than not led to empty pages and never facilated the starting of new blog entries.  The [[CSS]] page used to also be available from each page.   These were removed in 2005.
