I am Hoan Ton-That.  I love Emacs, we've been together since 2003.
We've shared many great times together, like reading news and mail,
browsing the web, and programming.  One day I woke up and found out
that Emacs had dynamic scope, a poor package system and was a MAN!!!

Our relationship was never the same after that.  Although we still
see each other regulary, I don't program in Elisp.  One product of our
time together was JournalMode, who is currently an orphan waiting
for someone to adopt it.  Maybe I'll get back together with Emacs
just for his sake, becuase he looks a total mess!

Anyway we all move on in life.  Who knows what path will lead us to
the spirit who lives in the computer. And oh yeah, in case you didn't
know: I use Emacs.

You can email me at hoan@ton-that.org, my website is
http://www.ton-that.org, and I'm hoan on the EmacsChannel.
