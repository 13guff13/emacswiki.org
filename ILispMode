'''ILISP''': a generalized (X)Emacs
interface to an underlying LispLanguage
system

* http://ilisp.cons.org/
* http://sourceforge.net/projects/ilisp/

ILISP is a package that is designed to integrate various Lisp implementations
(mostly Common Lisp systems and various Scheme dialects) within Emacs (or
XEmacs). 

ILISP runs an inferior Lisp process (in Emacs parlance) and provides a
specialized set of commands, key bindings, and menus to ease the interaction
with it. ILISP commands access the underlying Lisp process and provide ways
to make the editing, compilation and execution of Lisp programs much easier. 

Currently ILISP can handle the connection with the following Common Lisp
and Scheme implementations: CLiki:CMUCL, CLiki:CLISP by B. Haible and M. Stoll,
Harlequin <nowiki>LispWorks</nowiki>, Franz Allegro CL, many KCL derivatives (including
CLiki:GCL), CLiki:SBCL and various [[Scheme]] implementations. 

'''Problem''': If you type a single right paran ')' and hit return, ilisp stops
responding (e.g. type 42<return> we should see 42 evaluated, but it doesn't).
How do we get out of this situation once it starts? '''Solution''': Keep hitting backspace to delete everything up to and including the bracket and start again.

== Example of Program Development Using Emacs and ILISP ==

This example can be included in Emacs's start-up file, ".emacs".  Change the
login name, name of the remote host, and pathname of the Lisp to be invoked.
Emacs can be programmed for development in other languages besides Lisp, as
well.

    ;;; This load hook defines a Lisp "dialect" that can be invoked by ILISP
    ;;; as directed by the user's response to ILISP's "Dialect: " prompt.
    (add-hook 'ilisp-load-hook
          '(lambda ()
             (message "Running ilisp-load-hook")
             (setq ilisp-load-hook
                   '(lambda ()
                     ;; Define a new dialect to run on another machine.
                     (defdialect
                      cmulisp-remote
                      "CMU Common Lisp Remotely Executed."
                      cmulisp
                      (setq ilisp-program
                      "ssh thomas@computer1001 /usr/local/bin/lisp")))))
