== Variable load-history ==

Variable `load-history' records ''lots'' of information about what libraries have been loaded in your session so far, what functions and variables they each define, and what other libraries they require. Try `C-h v load-history' - you'll get a ''very'' long list.

The information in `load-history' differs between different versions of Emacs.  At least Emacs 20 contains less information than Emacs 21.  Emacs 21 on the other hand has a bug that results in missing entries in `load-history'.  Hopefully you are using Emacs 22 or 23 by now.

== Library loadhist.el ==

Standard library `<code>loadhist.el</code>' uses the information in `load-history' to let you unload a feature that was added when you loaded its library (command `unload-feature'). 

It also provides functions that let you know which library loaded a given function (`feature-symbols'), the features required by a given library (`file-requires'), the (loaded) libraries that require a given library (`file-dependents'), and the features provided by a given library (`file-provides').

In other words, it's a gold mine of information about the files, features, functions, and variables that have been loaded -- in particular, about their interrelations.

[:LibRequires]
== Library lib-requires.el ==

Library <tt>[[lib-requires.el]]</tt> extends some of the functionality of standard library `<code>loadhist.el</code>'. Its aim is to provide information about the libraries that are required by a given library, ''recursively''. That is, it tells you all of the libraries that are ultimately required, so it is kind of a super-`file-requires'.

These are the commands provided by ##lib-requires.el##:

* `lib-requires-tree' -- returns a tree of all of the `require' dependencies for a library, at all levels
* `lib-requires' -- returns a flat list of all libraries ultimately required by a library
* `insert-lib-requires-as-comment' -- inserts a comment into Lisp code, listing the libraries returned by `lib-requires'

Here is the value returned by `lib-requires-tree' for library `doremi-frm':

  (("doremi" ("ring+" "ring") mwheel)
   "hexrgb"
   ("ring+" "ring")
   ("frame-fns" "avoid")
   ("frame-cmds" ("strings" "thingatpt" ("thingatpt+" "thingatpt"))
                 ("frame-fns" "avoid")
                 ("icomplete+" "icomplete"))
   ("faces+" "faces" "thingatpt" ("thingatpt+" "thingatpt")))

Notice here that some of the same libraries are required more than once. For instance, library `thingatpt' is required by `<code>thingatpt+</code>', by `faces', and by `strings'. And since `<code>thingatpt+</code>' is required by `strings' and `<code>faces+</code>', `thingatpt' is ultimately required several times.

The usefulness of `lib-requires-tree' is that it shows you dependency structure. But `lib-requires' is more useful to just get the list of libraries ultimately required by a library. Here is what it returns for library `doremi-frm' as argument:

  ("avoid" "doremi" "faces" "faces+" "frame-cmds" "frame-fns" 
           "hexrgb" "icomplete" "icomplete+" mwheel "ring" "ring+" 
           "strings" "thingatpt" "thingatpt+")

And here is the Lisp comment that is inserted by `insert-lib-requires-as-comment' for library `doremi-frm':

  ;;  Library `doremi-frm' requires these libraries:
  ;;
  ;;    `avoid', `doremi', `faces', `faces+', `frame-cmds', `frame-fns',
  ;;    `hexrgb', `icomplete', `icomplete+', `mwheel', `ring', `ring+',
  ;;    `strings', `thingatpt', `thingatpt+'.
  ;;

As for standard library `<code>loadhist.el</code>', library `<code>lib-requires.el</code>' uses the current value of `load-history' to determine library dependencies. However, its commands first try to load the library being interrogated, which should load all the libraries that it requires, updating `load-history'.

If a `require'd library fails to load, it will of course not be recorded in `load-history'. A '''soft `require'''' is one that raises no error if the required library is not loaded (e.g. not found); a '''hard `require'''' raises an error.

: _Soft require_: <code>(require 'frame-cmds nil t)</code> -- no error if not found
: _Hard require_: <code>(require 'ring+)</code> -- error if not found

Given the knowledge of a soft `require' for library `frame-cmds', and looking at the example of `lib-requires-tree' for library `doremi-frm', you can see that some of the libraries `require'd by `frame-cmds' are not really required.

Notice from the examples above that both `lib-requires-tree' and `lib-requires' generally return '''''strings''''' as library names -- these are the ''file names'' (sans extension) of the corresponding required ''features''. 

Notice too that in both examples above, feature `mwheel' is ''not'' represented by a string, but by a '''''symbol'''''. What that means is that feature `mwheel' was not in fact loaded (it was not found): it is required (by library `doremi'), but it was not loaded. Since no error was raised, we know that `mwheel' is a soft `require' of `doremi'. (Library `mwheel' is available in Emacs21 but not in Emacs 20; a hard `require' would make library `doremi' fail to load in Emacs 20.)

Otherwise, for libraries that were successfully loaded, there is '''''no way to tell whether a given `require' is soft or hard'''''. This is very unfortunate, because such information is important, but `load-history' does not record such a distinction, so there is nothing that can be done in this regard.

'''See Also:''' '''AutomaticFileHeaders''' for use of library <tt>[[lib-requires.el]]</tt> in automatically inserting and updating a comment with library dependencies (via ‘insert-lib-requires-as-comment’).

== Library elisp-depend.el ==

ElispDepend is similar in some ways to <tt>[[lib-requires.el]]</tt>. A difference is that <tt>[[elisp-depend.el]]</tt> considers also autoloaded definitions (not just loaded libraries) to be dependencies. It parses the code in the current buffer, using `symbol-file' to determine the defining (possibly autoloaded) library for each symbol. Like ##lib-requires.el##, you can use ##elisp-depend.el## to insert a comment about libraries that might be needed, but you can also use it to insert appropriate `require' and `autoload' code.

== Library elx.el ==

Library <tt>[http://github.com/tarsius/elx elx.el]</tt> can extract all kinds of information from an elisp file.  It is similar to standard library <tt>lisp-mnt.el</tt>.  Both of these libraries do not require the library from which information is extracted to be loaded.  <tt>lisp-mnt.el</tt> actually only extracts information from the library header.  <tt>elx.el</tt> on the other hand also provides functions <tt>elx-required</tt> and <tt>elx-provided</tt> which extract dependency information using regular expressions.  Therefor it can be used in situations where some of the required libraries are not actually available or when one does not want to load the libraries for performance or security reasons.
