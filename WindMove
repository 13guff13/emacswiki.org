Windmove is a package that allows you to move point from window to window using Shift and the arrow keys.  This is easier to type than <code>C-x o</code> and, for some users, may be more intuitive.  To activate all these keybindings, add the following to your ~/.emacs file:

    (when (fboundp 'windmove-default-keybindings)
      (windmove-default-keybindings))

The `fbound' test is for those XEmacs installations that don't have
the windmove package available.

If you are a PcSelectionMode or CuaMode user, however, you will need to use your own keybindings, since shift plus arrow keys are used to extend the selection.
For CuaMode it may be natural to use

    (windmove-default-keybindings 'meta)

This will override M-left and M-right but these are duplicated by C-left and C-right which are probably more natural for a CuaMode user.

See WindowNavigation for a similar piece of code, but written from scratch.


If you want to use windmove on Xemacs, look at:
