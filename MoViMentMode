= Mo-vi-ment-mode =

MoViMentMode is a minor mode that provides vi-like cursor movement that's easy on the fingers. With MoViMentMode enabled, you can move the cursor like so -

        M-]
   
   M-p       M-\
   
        M-[

Pressing the 'shift' key while moving the cursor this way will move the cursor by line/page.

== Installation ==
Via MELPA:

   M-x package-install RET mo-vi-ment-mode

Or drop ##mo-vi-ment.el## somewhere in your load path, and add this to your ##.emacs.d/init.el## file -

   (require 'mo-vi-ment)

== Usage ==
Enabling it -

   M-x mo-vi-ment-mode

For a more permanent solution, add this to your ##.emacs.d/init.el## file -

   (mo-vi-ment-mode 1)
