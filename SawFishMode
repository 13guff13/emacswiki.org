Sawfish is a window manager that can be extended using a Lisp dialect.  See ExtensibleSoftware and http://sawmill.sourceforge.net/.

[http://www.davep.org/emacs/#sawfish.el sawfish.el] is some elisp code that will put your ~/.sawfishrc file (and other sawfish source files) into sawfish mode.  There, you can use `C-x C-e' to run `sawfish-eval-last-sexp'.

My ~/.sawfishrc contains the following lines, for example:

<pre>
(require 'sawmill-defaults)

(setq apps-menu
      '(("Terminal" (system "terminal &"))
	("Root" (system "root &"))
	("Emacs 20.7" (system "emacs-20.7 &"))
	("XEmacs 21.4" (system "xemacs-21.4.1 &"))
	("Netscape" (system "netscape &"))
	("Galeon" (system "galeon &"))
	("xchat" (system "xchat &"))
	("The GIMP" (system "gimp &"))
	("XFIG" (system "xfig &"))))
</pre>

Editing these lines and hitting `C-x C-e' I can change the apps-menu on the fly.
