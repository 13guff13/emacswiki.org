It's really tedious having that massive code block in there. Maybe we should implement some form of hiding? I'd like to be able to run text alongside a big code block like that actually. That would be cool.

I've added a text formatting rule that passes ##<div class="...">## and ##<div style="...">## and ##</div>## through without checking for correct nesting.
Incorrect nesting makes me unhappy but I don't have a good solution at hand and I'll leave it to you to get the CSS right. If you have something that you think will work as a generic solution, we can add it as a class to the standard CSS file.

I hate the idea of passing through HTML. I think we should eradicate HTML from the Wiki (it would make the job of elwiki a *lot* easier).

So I'd revert that, personally.

(the nesting is one of the reasons I don't believe in using HTML btw)

I think a better solution will involve changing the renderer for pre-formatted sections to:

# guess the content a bit better (look for start magic, other patterns?)  
# look at length and truncate it in CSS if it's too long (overflow)
# shade the background

I'm going to make tickets in elwiki and creole referencing this page.

If you paste the code to a separate page, all these issues are moot.

As for #1, you mean just like what you get when pasting files onto separate pages? Maybe ##^\(## means use Lisp highlighting?
Perhaps you'd be better of using [[Gists]]?

Do you have an example for #2?

As for #3, something that looks [http://www.oddmuse.org/cgi-bin/oddmuse/Bootstrap_and_jQuery like this]?
If not, can you provide some CSS?
