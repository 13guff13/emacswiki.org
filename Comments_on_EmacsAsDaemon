It's really tedious having that massive code block in there. Maybe we should implement some form of hiding? I'd like to be able to run text alongside a big code block like that actually. That would be cool.

I've added a text formatting rule that passes ##<div class="...">## and ##<div style="...">## and ##</div>## through without checking for correct nesting.
Incorrect nesting makes me unhappy but I don't have a good solution at hand and I'll leave it to you to get the CSS right. If you have something that you think will work as a generic solution, we can add it as a class to the standard CSS file.
