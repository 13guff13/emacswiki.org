A backend plugging into the slime completion mechanism:

Lisp:slime-company.el

It can display docstrings and display the source of a completion candidate.
Please note that it needs a Slime not older than 2009-11-07.

A variant that is always kept compatible with the latest Slime ELPA package is available at:
http://gist.github.com/179847

The first version of this file, for use with an older Slime, can be found at:
