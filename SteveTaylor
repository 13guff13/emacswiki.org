My strongest web presence right now is a wiki site for a 20-year volunteer love that does free dinners 3 times a year in Ottawa, Canada

* [http://www.dinnersunlimited.ca Dinners Unlimited]

Editing, copy-editing, technical writing, Perl hacking, Lisp
hacking, and database development are my interests

Wikis and the web can be forums of ''change and growth.'', we hope.

I use Emacs.

For now, it's on Debian Gnu/Linux 4.0. Both machine, o.s. and emacs
are waiting patiently for me to fix a serial ports bug and upgrade.

I do infrequent edits of this page but emacs is still my first editor.

Favorite alias is [::duo2], for dountoothers. My lofty ambition; they are also  my Twitter usernames, as well as some 8-char step.... name variations.
