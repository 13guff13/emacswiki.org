If you want to highlight long lines you can use whitespace-mode:

    (setq whitespace-style '(lines))
    (setq whitespace-line-column 78)
    (global-whitespace-mode 1)

whitespace-mode can also highlight other nasty things:

    (setq whitespace-style '(tabs trailing lines tab-mark))

Or you can write some elisp code:

    (font-lock-add-keywords 
     'emacs-lisp-mode
     '(("^[^\n]\\{80\\}\\(.*\\)$"
        1 font-lock-warning-face prepend)))

The first parameter indicates the major mode in which this setting should be
enabled.  You can use `c-mode', `java-mode', etc.

The first part of the RegularExpression, ##"^[^\n]\\{80\\}"##,
matches any 80 non-newline characters at the beginning of a line.
The first group in parentheses matches the 81st character and all
remaining characters.  The digit ##1## tells font-lock to
fontifiy the first group.  `font-lock-warning-face' is the [[Face]]
to use.  The `prepend' parameter tells font-lock to use this as
the most important rule.  Therefore even lines that are
highlighted as comments will have the warning face on every
character after the 81st.

Note that this will not take the width of ##TAB## characters into account.
(See EightyColumnRule for a way to do that)
