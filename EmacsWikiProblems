== Site search misses stuff ==

Search for "apropos-fn+var.el", or even just "apropos-fn+var".  You will not find most of the pages that link to page <tt>[[apropos-fn+var.el]]</tt>.

Now search for just "apropos-fn", and you will find them -- 4 pages of links.

Now try searching for "BrowseKillRing" -- that page is not found.  Now try "browse kill ring" or "browse-kill-ring".  After checking the 10 pages of links you discover that page BrowseKillRing appeards nowhere.

Now try to find this page: BufferMenuPlus.  Now try clicking the title of page <tt>[[buff-menu+.el]]</tt> and looking through the search-hit links for page BufferMenuPlus.  No luck.  Same thing for DiredPlus from <tt>[[dired+.el]]</tt>.  Try finding DiredSortMenu using "dired sort menu" or by clicking the title of <tt>[[dired-sort-menu+.el]]</tt>.  You get the idea.

What's wrong? -- DrewAdams

[new]
Google.  I am noticing similar issues with global google search more and more often.  E.g. it seems google treats "-" as whitespace and then looks for the resulting separate words. It's becoming harder and harder to "google" documentation of lisp symbol.  The same happens for camelCase and file/paths, or at least I am getting that impression.

Edit: In case of apropos-fn or org-something it gets worse: fn? that's not a word let's just ignore it. org? that's certainly organisation.

Edit 2: We cannot rename every page that google cannot find like done for the below issue.  Maybe we should switch to another search engine instead.

Edit 3: Or maybe google just/additionally penalizes the emacswiki for offering N different urls for the same content.  I think it would be worth while using just a single url and redirect all the others even if it wasn't for the google issue.

-- JonasBernoulli

I see a trend here:

=== Site search misses main page for highlight.el ===

Visit <tt>[[highlight.el]]</tt>. Click the title to google-search for references to that page.  There are 5 pages of hits, but none of them are HighLight, which is the main page documenting Lisp:highlight.el.  There is even a link ##Lisp:highlight.el## on page HighLight, so it can't just be a problem of using ##<tt>[[highlight.el]]</tt>## instead of ##Lisp:##.  Maybe the problem has something to do with case-sensitivity in the page name "##HighLight##"? -- DrewAdams

[new]
I think that's because when serving the page, the wiki tries to split page names based on !CamelCase -> Camel Case -- this is what Google picks up (in addition to the h1 header). Thus, if you search for "highlight" you won't find !HighLight because it registers as "High Light". If you search for "high light" instead, you'll find the correct page. Perhaps we should create a new page called Highlight, move the !HighLight content there, and have !HighLight redirect to Highlight? -- AlexSchroeder

[new:DrewAdams:2011-11-04 20:17 UTC]
Thanks for the explanation.  Still, I don't quite understand.  I thought that explicit links to the target page (<tt>[[highlight.el]]</tt> in this case) were taken into account, i.e. by picking up the link sources (sort of like Google does in general, when trying to rank a page).  How does a search for the text ##highlight## come into the picture?  Is the search only for the text ##highlight.el##, or are links taken into account?

Wrt your suggestion, I don't think that's the solution here, but I might rename the page to something a bit different -- and less general sounding-- anyway.  Thx -- DrewAdams

[new]
I can't say I understand completely, either. Google ought to know that there is a page with Url bla/HighLight, title High Light and h1 HighLight -- why doesn't a search for "highlight" find it? I don't know. :(

=== Page not found by search ===

Just mentioning in case it indicates a bug: Search for ##DiredPlus## and you will not see the DiredPlus page in the list.  But search for ##GrepPlus## and you will see the GrepPlus page.  Wonder why. -- DrewAdams

=== Problem with Google search ===

[new] If you search for the word "sticky" you do not find the page StickyModifiers, but that word is on that page. -- LennartBorgman
[new] hmm searching  for "sticky site:.emacswiki.org" google find thse page with the url: www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs-en/StickyModifiers, maybe it's just a problem of adding a couple more url in the custom search  -- PierreGaston 
[new] I added ##http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs-*## to the list of sites. Previously the site list contained only ##http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/*##. I think the real problem is that I would want all the URLs matching ##http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs-*## to be registered as ##http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki##. Ah the joys of fiddling with search engines. :) -- AlexSchroeder
[new] Thanks! -- LennartBorgman
[new] Is there something magic with StickyModifiers (except that it saves you)? You can't search for StickyModifiers now. Or for "sticky modifiers". Anyone understands this? -- LennartBorgman
[new] I set my search languages to Chinese in google search preferences, so when I search in emacswiki.org, only a few pages can be found, can I just search all languages in emacswiki.org without change my google preferences? Or in the page of search result provides a radio button to select language.  
-- [[Ye_Wenbin]]

=== Search Flooded with Source Code ===

(this issue is actually different from the above)

No idea how much control you have over the search. However, currently searches often are useless to me, because they show only source code files. Try searching for "defmacro", for instance; maybe that is because it isn't discussed anywhere on the wiki, but I have no way of finding out. Please allow to exclude sources from the search results. -- OlafB

[new]
The ElispArea used to be separate, but now it is not.  Oddmuse:Searching would need to be improved to be able to differentiate code. -- AaronHawley

[new]
I'm not sure what to do. Fiddling with the search engine configuration might work, but how would we search for code examples, then? Add a second search box for code only? Yuck. There\s not much configuration going on because we are using Google Search. I don't see a way to add checkboxes and other options to influence it.

Somebody could start working on a multi-lingual setup for Lucene or whatever the search engine of choice is for people who want to do it themselves. I remember looking at it and thinking that it looked like a lot of work for little gain.

For the example given, Google returns MacroBasics on third place. That's not so bad, is it?

We could certainly add options to the [[Search]] page. would that be acceptable? -- AlexSchroeder

=== both www.emacsen.org and emacsen.org work without one redirecting to the other ===

This might not be the best setup, Google-juice-wise. Permanently redirecting from one to the other seems like the way to go.

Additionally, even with a domain, pages lack a canonical URI; ##/cgi-bin/emacs/foo##, ##/cgi-bin/emacs-en/foo##, and ##/cgi-bin/wiki/foo## all work. I suggest redirecting all of those to ##/wiki/foo##.

[new]
Yeah, I think you're right. I'm not comfortable enough with mod_alias, mod_rewrite, and all those and I don't have an automated test suite that would point out how changes to .htaccess are affecting the site. That's why I hesitate to fix these. -- AlexSchroeder





== Revisioning Problems ==

=== Conflict from my own edit 25 minutes ago? ===

I edited page [[icicles-opt.el]] and saved. Later I tried to do the same thing. I got a lock message. I used the browser Back button to get to the editing again and saved again. I then got this:

<pre>
This page was changed by somebody else 25 minutes ago. The changes conflict. Please check the page again.

It's telling me my two edits conflict, and it is not recognizing that I am me. ;-) -- DrewAdams

[new]
That's very strange indeed! I thought that once you're using a username -- which you clearly are -- then that doesn't happen anymore. I'll have to look at that code again. -- AlexSchroeder

[new:DrewAdams:2010-06-05 13:55 UTC]
It just happened that once. And I simply pasted and saved the file again, so there was no damage in the end. -- DrewAdams

[:EditingGetsOldPageText]
=== editing does not get most recent version ===

I tried yet again to get emacs-w3m to work as described above.  I edited.  It didn't work.  I edited the page with Safari.  It worked.  Then I followed the instructions again in emacs-w3m.  The Safari edit did not show up in the compose edit box, even though the page did show it.  Therefore, the text that the user edits is not the same as the text that is shown.  Is this a cache issue?  Thanks.

[new]
There's some technical information available here, if you want to take a look at it: Oddmuse:Caching. As I'm currently in Costa Rica, I can't help you. All I know is that it worked for me -- and I went through all the trouble of downloading and compiling w3m and dependencies. -- AlexSchroeder

=== RecentChanges doesn't reflect recent changes ===

I just edited and saved a reply someone posted at DrewsElispLibraries. I refrefreshed RecentChanges (with rollbacks and minor changes included), but my edit does not appear. That wiki page is listed, but still at the time and user of the previous edit. However, after clicking List only major changes it was listed. I had previously cleared my cache, so I don't think that was the problem. I'm guessing it was a cache problem nevertheless, but thought I'd mention it, in case it's not. -- DrewAdams

=== Invisible change ===

[new]
Someone edited [[Emacsmirror]] months ago but the change is not visible on the page. When I edit the page I can see the added text.  I haven't tried yet what happens when I save the page.  Maybe that would cause the old edit to become effective but I wanted to leave it as-is so you can see for yourself. -- JonasBernoulli

[new]
Hm, I'm not sure. When [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Emacsmirror?cache=0 using the cache=0 parameter] the page doesn't mention "solarized" so I think editing the page will not make a big change. I wonder where the diff comes from, however.





== Site is very slow now ==

Takes me several minutes to load the Elisp Area page -- or else it hangs altogether (times out). Likewise to get to one of the Lisp files there.  Likewise, it takes a long time to preview (e.g. this edit).  And yes, I tried closing the browser and deleting the cache. -- DrewAdams

[new]
Is this happening to anybody else? What about the time? Whenever I use the site, it seems to be working just fine. -- AlexSchroeder


== CGI Internal error: 400 Bad request (malformed multipart POST) ==

I just got this error when trying to save a page after some simple (trivial) editing.  No idea what caused it or what the problem is.  I then clicked the browser `Back' button and tried, successfully, to save again.  -- DrewAdams

[new]
Anybody else? I've never seen this before. -- AlexSchroeder

== FYI - still getting Server Error ==

Just an FYI that this problem has not disappeared, even if it is less frequent. -- DrewAdams




== Problem with `Manual:' syntax? ==

How to make a `##Manual:##' link to `##(elisp) Circular Objects##'?  I tried ##[[Manual:Circular Objects]]## and a few variants, but didn't find anything that works.  -- DrewAdams

[new]
Manual:Circular%20Objects is the right form. In a wiki URL, space is represented by an underscore. Using double square brackets might do the wrong thing in this context. -- AlexSchroeder


== Apostrophes etc. not prettified in links ==

* ##ain't -- it -- "nice"## => ain't -- it -- "nice"
* ##[EmacsWikiProblems ain't -- it -- "nice"]## => [EmacsWikiProblems ain't -- it -- "nice"]

The link text retains its crude ASCII formatting. -- VegardOye








[:StalePagesServed]
== Browser Cache Not Refreshed - Stale Pages Served ==

This might be the same problem as [[#EditingGetsOldPageText]], below, but since that speaks specifically about emacs-w3m, I'm not sure.

This problem started several months ago. The browser cache does not get refreshed when pages are edited and saved. This happens for different browsers.

This problem has bitten several people, and the only workaround seems to be to remember to manually force a cache refresh when, say, you are looking at the editable page. And even that doesn't work if you use the Download link.

This causes people to download the wrong version of a page (e.g. an Emacs Lisp library, using the Download link). And it causes people to accidentally overwrite a previous edit by someone else (since it doesn't appear in the editable text unless they refresh that text).

I know that some people have thought that the problem was that pages were not being locked properly for edits, so that two people editing at the same time could accidentally overwrite each other's edits. I don't know if that problem also exists, but I do know that this cache problem has caused people to think there is a locking problem for edits. The cache problem occurs however, even for an edit that is long after (days after) the last edit has been saved, so it is not a lock problem.

Thanks for looking into this. -- DrewAdams


[new:DrewAdams:2009-11-04 07:10 UTC]
This is still happening, but I still cannot give a recipe for why or when it happens -- it happens sometimes. It just happened now. In the same browser session, I updated page DoReMi and saved. Then opened that page again from the link at RecentChanges, using browser's Open Link in New Window. Then clicked Edit the page and got the old page source, before my edit and save. HTH -- DrewAdams


[new:DrewAdams:2010-02-04 01:35 UTC]
Some more info on this, in case it helps. I was just bitten by this again -- I had to redo a bunch of edits as a result. 

If you look at the revisions of BookmarkPlus between Revision 53 and Revision 58, you'll see that Revision 54 was a major edit, then 55 was a minor edit. Well, 55 did not use 54 as its starting point -- it used 53 instead. So I ended up doing 55, 56, 57, and 58, before I realized that the major edit for 54 had been undone (i.e. lost).

I used to think this problem had something to do with the browser cache, but now I'm thinking it has something to do with major and minor edits. HTH. -- DrewAdams


[new:DrewAdams:2010-03-22 17:24 UTC]
Dunno if this is strictly related to the browser cache problem that I've been assuming exists, but there is a fine example of losing page updates that just occurred. See the revisions of this very page, EmacsWikiProblems, today.

You'll see that this sequence of events took place:

# I updated the page to reply to SteveTaylor about the mistaken rollback: revision 608.
# VegardOye updated the page to add a new item: revision 609.

Vegard's update wiped out my previous update. -- DrewAdams

[new]
Hm, maybe this is unrelated. Possibly it just took him more than nine minutes to edit the page before he saved it? Perhaps diff3 will sometimes merge things and drop changes without marking them as a conflict? Or he used a raw client that interacts with the wiki text directly, didn't post back the last modification date, thus diff3 was unable to determine the ancestor for conflict resolution, and he ended up overwriting what you had done. I think the caching problem you reported earlier is something else (and much trickier, apparently). -- AlexSchroeder

== Browser `Open in New Window' no longer works on wiki pages ==

This has changed in the last day or so -- since the spam attack. 

On EmacsWiki, I can no longer right-click a link (any link) and choose '''Open in New Window'''. I use IE6, and I have Google Toolbar installed (since a long time ago). When I try to open a link in a new window, Google Toolbar treats the attempt as a pop-up and blocks it.

I am forced to duplicate the browser window (`C-n') and then find and click the link. This is very slow, since the current page needs to be reloaded  in the new window even though I'm going to move away from it.

I have this problem only for %%EmacsWiki%% pages, and I have changed nothing in my browser etc.  Does this perhaps have something to do with the change to use [http://recaptcha.net/ reCAPTCHA]? 

This is really quite annoying. I can make the problem go away by choosing '''Popups okay''' for Google Toolbar (for %%EmacsWiki%%), but users shouldn't need to do that. %%EmacsWiki%% appears unfriendly to people with this behavior. -- DrewAdams

[new]
I believe you. Unfortunately I don't know what to do about it. I'm sure your browsing environment will allow you to define exceptions to the popup blocker. -- AlexSchroeder

[new:DrewAdams:2008-09-07 06:27 UTC]
Yes, as I said, I've done that. The point was that it's a shame that users will now need to do that -- some might become discouraged or not understand. What's odd is that I've never seen this (treating '''Open in New Window''' as a popup) on any other site. Anyway, it's not a biggee. And perhaps it affects only IE6 users who happen to use Google Toolbar -- dunno. -- DrewAdams

== TOC heading in wrong language ==

At TreeMode (http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/TreeMode), the page is in English, but the TOC title is in Chinese. -- DrewAdams.

[new]
This is also happening on [[CSS]]. I tried faking an edit, but it doesn't seem to have done any good. -- SamuelBronson.

[new]
Yeah, it's saving the TOC title in the language of the user saving it and not re-generating it for the current user. Samuel's attempt at faking an edit probably failed because you have to actually change a byte of the page text -- appending an extra newline at the end usually works for me. As to the general issue: Would getting rid of the TOC title work for you? It seems a bit superfluous. -- Alex

[new]
More info on this at [[2006-01-12]]. -- AaronHawley


== Markup of `RET C-i' ==

Why doesn't the quoted markup of `RET C-i' work?  `RET' works. -- AaronHawley

[new]
At the very end of the [http://emacswiki.org/emacs/config config file] you can see the rule I'm using:

         /\G(\`|‘)([CM][- ][- A-Za-z0-9<>;:#]+)(\'|’)/cg
      or /\G(\`|‘)([-A-Za-z0-9\/\*]+[=]?)(\'|’)/cg

I think the first regexp matches keys and the second matches symbols. Thus `RET' works because it looks like a symbol. The tricky part is coming up with something that doesn't cause false positives... Untested suggestion...

         /\G(\`|‘)(([CM][- ][- A-Za-z0-9<>;:#]+|RET|TAB|DEL|<(tab|f[0-9]+)>) ?)+(\'|’)/cg

-- AlexSchroeder

[new]
Alright, I'll just use `C-m C-i'.  I'll have to try and find time to investigate the consequences of changing that regexp, though. -- AaronHawley





== emacswiki and w3m ==

EmacsWiki doesnt appear to work well with w3m, specifically the search button. --JoakimVerona

Try this solution, been using it a while now --[[pft]]:

   (define-key w3m-mode-map "\C-c\C-c" 
     '(lambda ()
        (interactive)
        (if (member 'w3m-href-anchor (text-properties-at (point)))
            (w3m-view-this-url)
          (w3m-submit-form))))

=== RSS for single-pages doesn't work in Google Reader ===

I haven't figured out what the problem is yet, but I added http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/?action=rss;rcidonly=IciclesDiscussion to Google Reader, and it didn't get a "new item" notification when the page was changed. -- EthanGlasserCamp

[new]
When I look at the RSS feed, I get to see the latest revision of the page. I must therefore assume that it's Google Reader's fault. I can imagine two problems: 1. It takes very long for changes to be picked up by Google. That's the explanation I currently favor because I have several of my own wikis in Google Reader and I often have the impression that Google Reader is up to a day late. 2. Google Reader thinks that you're looking at an update to an existing page and will not show it anymore. I remember there was such an option for Blog Lines, but I can't find anything like it for Google Reader. -- AlexSchroeder
