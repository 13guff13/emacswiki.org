Could it be the rapid fire uploads this afternoon :)
Maybe Alex has a throttle per the spammers?
It looks like you identified a problem at 20:48 UTC.
Are the changes from 21:40 UTC -> 21:55 UTC your attempts to reproduce the problems?
If not then the 20+ uploads between then 20:48 and 21:16 UTC may be more than this little wiki can handle.
Weird internal server errors can also indicate a looming hard-disk failure...  --[[mon_key]]



[:StalePagesServed]
== Browser Cache Not Refreshed - Stale Pages Served ==

This might be the same problem as [[#EditingGetsOldPageText]], below, but since that speaks specifically about emacs-w3m, I'm not sure.

This problem started several months ago. The browser cache does not get refreshed when pages are edited and saved. This happens for different browsers.

This problem has bitten several people, and the only workaround seems to be to remember to manually force a cache refresh when, say, you are looking at the editable page. And even that doesn't work if you use the Download link.

This causes people to download the wrong version of a page (e.g. an Emacs Lisp library, using the Download link). And it causes people to accidentally overwrite a previous edit by someone else (since it doesn't appear in the editable text unless they refresh that text).

I know that some people have thought that the problem was that pages were not being locked properly for edits, so that two people editing at the same time could accidentally overwrite each other's edits. I don't know if that problem also exists, but I do know that this cache problem has caused people to think there is a locking problem for edits. The cache problem occurs however, even for an edit that is long after (days after) the last edit has been saved, so it is not a lock problem.

Thanks for looking into this. -- DrewAdams


[new:DrewAdams:2009-11-04 07:10 UTC]
This is still happening, but I still cannot give a recipe for why or when it happens -- it happens sometimes. It just happened now. In the same browser session, I updated page DoReMi and saved. Then opened that page again from the link at RecentChanges, using browser's Open Link in New Window. Then clicked Edit the page and got the old page source, before my edit and save. HTH -- DrewAdams


[new:DrewAdams:2010-02-04 01:35 UTC]
Some more info on this, in case it helps. I was just bitten by this again -- I had to redo a bunch of edits as a result. 

If you look at the revisions of BookmarkPlus between Revision 53 and Revision 58, you'll see that Revision 54 was a major edit, then 55 was a minor edit. Well, 55 did not use 54 as its starting point -- it used 53 instead. So I ended up doing 55, 56, 57, and 58, before I realized that the major edit for 54 had been undone (i.e. lost).

I used to think this problem had something to do with the browser cache, but now I'm thinking it has something to do with major and minor edits. HTH. -- DrewAdams


[new:DrewAdams:2010-03-22 17:24 UTC]
Dunno if this is strictly related to the browser cache problem that I've been assuming exists, but there is a fine example of losing page updates that just occurred. See the revisions of this very page, EmacsWikiProblems, today.

You'll see that this sequence of events took place:

# I updated the page to reply to SteveTaylor about the mistaken rollback: revision 608.
# VegardOye updated the page to add a new item: revision 609.

Vegard's update wiped out my previous update. -- DrewAdams

[new]
Hm, maybe this is unrelated. Possibly it just took him more than nine minutes to edit the page before he saved it? Perhaps diff3 will sometimes merge things and drop changes without marking them as a conflict? Or he used a raw client that interacts with the wiki text directly, didn't post back the last modification date, thus diff3 was unable to determine the ancestor for conflict resolution, and he ended up overwriting what you had done. I think the caching problem you reported earlier is something else (and much trickier, apparently). -- AlexSchroeder

== w3m ==

To edit the wiki using [[w3m]] make sure you enable cookies in w3m! Hit ##o## for options and check for the following:

{{{
Cookie Settings

Enable cookie processing                           (*)YES  ( )NO
Print a message when receiving a cookie            (*)YES  ( )NO
Accept cookies                                     (*)YES  ( )NO
}}}

Next, [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/uihnscuskc/SiteMap follow this

[:EditingGetsOldPageText]
== editing does not get most recent version ==

I tried yet again to get emacs-w3m to work as described above.  I edited.  It didn't work.  I edited the page with Safari.  It worked.  Then I followed the instructions again in emacs-w3m.  The Safari edit did not show up in the compose edit box, even though the page did show it.  Therefore, the text that the user edits is not the same as the text that is shown.  Is this a cache issue?  Thanks.

[new]
There's some technical information available here, if you want to take a look at it: Oddmuse:Caching. As I'm currently in Costa Rica, I can't help you. All I know is that it worked for me -- and I went through all the trouble of downloading and compiling w3m and dependencies. -- AlexSchroeder

== Browser `Open in New Window' no longer works on wiki pages ==

This has changed in the last day or so -- since the spam attack. 

On EmacsWiki, I can no longer right-click a link (any link) and choose '''Open in New Window'''. I use IE6, and I have Google Toolbar installed (since a long time ago). When I try to open a link in a new window, Google Toolbar treats the attempt as a pop-up and blocks it.

I am forced to duplicate the browser window (`C-n') and then find and click the link. This is very slow, since the current page needs to be reloaded  in the new window even though I'm going to move away from it.

I have this problem only for %%EmacsWiki%% pages, and I have changed nothing in my browser etc.  Does this perhaps have something to do with the change to use [http://recaptcha.net/ reCAPTCHA]? 

This is really quite annoying. I can make the problem go away by choosing '''Popups okay''' for Google Toolbar (for %%EmacsWiki%%), but users shouldn't need to do that. %%EmacsWiki%% appears unfriendly to people with this behavior. -- DrewAdams

[new]
I believe you. Unfortunately I don't know what to do about it. I'm sure your browsing environment will allow you to define exceptions to the popup blocker. -- AlexSchroeder

[new:DrewAdams:2008-09-07 06:27 UTC]
Yes, as I said, I've done that. The point was that it's a shame that users will now need to do that -- some might become discouraged or not understand. What's odd is that I've never seen this (treating '''Open in New Window''' as a popup) on any other site. Anyway, it's not a biggee. And perhaps it affects only IE6 users who happen to use Google Toolbar -- dunno. -- DrewAdams

== .emacs -> InitFile Substitution ==

Recently, "~/.emacs" strings have all been replaced by "InitFile" 
on the wiki pages. This is unfortunate, since non-english wiki pages
are now cluttered with references to the english InitFile page, 
instead of the corresponding
translation. It would have been better to make the substitution on the
english pages only, and let each locale deal with the problem 
in the appropriate way. Or better, just leave the ~/.emacs references, 
which do not depend on the locale.

[new]
Yeah, I'm not a big fan of large-scale changes myself. Hopefully that
person used a user name while doing the changes and then you can contact
them on their name page? -- AlexSchroeder

== RecentChanges doesn't reflect recent changes ==

I just edited and saved a reply someone posted at DrewsElispLibraries. I refrefreshed RecentChanges (with rollbacks and minor changes included), but my edit does not appear. That wiki page is listed, but still at the time and user of the previous edit. However, after clicking List only major changes it was listed. I had previously cleared my cache, so I don't think that was the problem. I'm guessing it was a cache problem nevertheless, but thought I'd mention it, in case it's not. -- DrewAdams


== TOC heading in wrong language ==

At TreeMode (http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/TreeMode), the page is in English, but the TOC title is in Chinese. -- DrewAdams.

[new]
This is also happening on [[CSS]]. I tried faking an edit, but it doesn't seem to have done any good. -- SamuelBronson.

[new]
Yeah, it's saving the TOC title in the language of the user saving it and not re-generating it for the current user. Samuel's attempt at faking an edit probably failed because you have to actually change a byte of the page text -- appending an extra newline at the end usually works for me. As to the general issue: Would getting rid of the TOC title work for you? It seems a bit superfluous. -- Alex

[new]
More info on this at [[2006-01-12]]. -- AaronHawley


== Markup of `RET C-i' ==

Why doesn't the quoted markup of `RET C-i' work?  `RET' works. -- AaronHawley

[new]
At the very end of the [http://emacswiki.org/emacs/config config file] you can see the rule I'm using:

         /\G(\`|‘)([CM][- ][- A-Za-z0-9<>;:#]+)(\'|’)/cg
      or /\G(\`|‘)([-A-Za-z0-9\/\*]+[=]?)(\'|’)/cg

I think the first regexp matches keys and the second matches symbols. Thus `RET' works because it looks like a symbol. The tricky part is coming up with something that doesn't cause false positives... Untested suggestion...

         /\G(\`|‘)(([CM][- ][- A-Za-z0-9<>;:#]+|RET|TAB|DEL|<(tab|f[0-9]+)>) ?)+(\'|’)/cg

-- AlexSchroeder

[new]
Alright, I'll just use `C-m C-i'.  I'll have to try and find time to investigate the consequences of changing that regexp, though. -- AaronHawley

== both www.emacsen.org and emacsen.org work without one redirecting to the other ==

This might not be the best setup, Google-juice-wise. Permanently redirecting from one to the other seems like the way to go.

Additionally, even with a domain, pages lack a canonical URI; ##/cgi-bin/emacs/foo##, ##/cgi-bin/emacs-en/foo##, and ##/cgi-bin/wiki/foo## all work. I suggest redirecting all of those to ##/wiki/foo##.

[new]
Yeah, I think you're right. I'm not comfortable enough with mod_alias, mod_rewrite, and all those and I don't have an automated test suite that would point out how changes to .htaccess are affecting the site. That's why I hesitate to fix these. -- AlexSchroeder

== emacswiki and w3m ==

EmacsWiki doesnt appear to work well with w3m, specifically the search button. --JoakimVerona

Try this solution, been using it a while now --[[pft]]:

   (define-key w3m-mode-map "\C-c\C-c" 
     '(lambda ()
        (interactive)
        (if (member 'w3m-href-anchor (text-properties-at (point)))
            (w3m-view-this-url)
          (w3m-submit-form))))

== Winky emoticon displayed instead of &amp; ==

[new]
When an ampersand happens to be surrounded by parentheses the wiki returns
the following:

    (&amp<img src="/pics/blink.png" alt=";)">

(&)

It seems that smilies are converted after unsafe characters.  Note that this
doesn't happen when it is escaped as code.

This bug was noticed on SampleWikiModeSetup. -- DianeMurray

[new]
Indeed: ##&)## -> &).  Wierd. -- AaronHawley

[new]
Hm yes, must be a problem with the ordering of the rules: After HTML escaping (which I do),
there is in fact a ##;)## in the source text.  I wonder why the ##&amp;## doesn't get
rendered first... -- AlexSchroeder

== Connection broken when uploading Elisp files ==

I can't upload files via the "replace this text with a file" link. After clicking the Save button, I get the error "The document contains no data" in Firefox 1.0.7 and "An error occurred while loading http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki: Connection to host www.emacswiki.org is broken" in Konqueror 3.4.1. Is anyone else getting this? --TobyCubitt

Update: I have the same problem under windows, using both Firefox and IE.
-- TobyCubitt

[new]
Any news on this issue? -- AlexSchroeder

[new]
2006-10-06 For me its the same as Toby describes (Firfox 1.0.8 under Fedora and IE under Windows).

Update 2006-10-14: My file seems too big, the wiki program blocked any furhter editing.  Alex Schroeder had to remove it by hand and uploaded a compressed version. -- [[dida]]

== Problem with Google search ==

[new] If you search for the word "sticky" you do not find the page StickyModifiers, but that word is on that page. -- LennartBorgman
[new] hmm searching  for "sticky site:.emacswiki.org" google find thse page with the url: www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs-en/StickyModifiers, maybe it's just a problem of adding a couple more url in the custom search  -- PierreGaston 
[new] I added ##http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs-*## to the list of sites. Previously the site list contained only ##http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/*##. I think the real problem is that I would want all the URLs matching ##http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs-*## to be registered as ##http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki##. Ah the joys of fiddling with search engines. :) -- AlexSchroeder
[new] Thanks! -- LennartBorgman
[new] Is there something magic with StickyModifiers (except that it saves you)? You can't search for StickyModifiers now. Or for "sticky modifiers". Anyone understands this? -- LennartBorgman
[new] I set my search languages to Chinese in google search preferences, so when I search in emacswiki.org, only a few pages can be found, can I just search all languages in emacswiki.org without change my google preferences? Or in the page of search result provides a radio button to select language.  
-- [[Ye_Wenbin]]

== Page names not split apart correctly in titles ==

EmacsWiki's title names are being split so that the search functionality works even when a word is mentioned only in a page's title.  The splitting is not quite correct, though, as neighboring capital letters aren't split apart.  Here a couple examples:

* HowToSetUpSemanticBovinatorForANewLanguage becomes "!EmacsWiki: How To Set Up Semantic Bovinator For ANew Language"

* WThreeMEditingWikis becomes "!EmacsWiki: WThree MEditing Wikis" ("W Three M Editing Wikis" would look odd as well but should be easier to read)

-- DianeMurray

[new]
I think that these names don't lend themselves to typical wiki-style linking anyway. They should be renamed to [[How To Set Up Semantic Bovinator For A New Language]] and [[w3m Editing Wikis]] or whatever seems appropriate. For titles that are not just two or three ordinary words smashed together, wiki-style names are a poor choice, and therefore I think my time is better spent elsewhere. If we fix this, there will always be another example showing that it isn't perfect.

If anybody else is interested in suggesting a solution, here's the code:

 $str =~ s/([[:lower:]])([[:upper:]])/$1 $2/g;

-- Alex

[new]
It can't get perfect, but something like this might be useable:

 $str =~ s/([^ ])([[:upper:]][[:lower:]])/$1 $2/g;
 $str =~ s/([^ ])([[:upper:]][[:lower:]])/$1 $2/g;
 $str =~ s/([[:lower:]])A /$1 A /g;

-- LennartBorgman

== RSS for single-pages doesn't work in Google Reader ==

I haven't figured out what the problem is yet, but I added http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/?action=rss;rcidonly=IciclesDiscussion to Google Reader, and it didn't get a "new item" notification when the page was changed. -- EthanGlasserCamp

[new]
When I look at the RSS feed, I get to see the latest revision of the page. I must therefore assume that it's Google Reader's fault. I can imagine two problems: 1. It takes very long for changes to be picked up by Google. That's the explanation I currently favor because I have several of my own wikis in Google Reader and I often have the impression that Google Reader is up to a day late. 2. Google Reader thinks that you're looking at an update to an existing page and will not show it anymore. I remember there was such an option for Blog Lines, but I can't find anything like it for Google Reader. -- AlexSchroeder

== File type "data" ==

file (see man file) returns "Lisp/Scheme program text" for most of the hosted libraries. However for Lisp:cscope.el, Lisp:less.el, Lisp:php-completion.el and Lisp:rcirc.el it returns "data". The files look okay at first glance. Might there be a problem with encoding? What else? Could this possibly be fixed by simply editing and resaving these files? The page BuildingEmacsWithMinGW is also reported as "data". This problem occurs regardless whether I download the file manually or get it using the subversion mirror.  -- JonasBernoulli

[new]
Well, I don't understand what file(1) actually does -- all I know is that it's unrelated to Emacs Wiki itself. I'm assuming that these files either contain non-ASCII bytes that throw file(1) off (page feed ^L? Latin-1 characters? wrong end of line encoding?). There's nothing I can do about that. -- AlexSchroeder

[new]
Yeah, this is nothing to do with the wiki: assuming you have the elisp sources installed, try something like this command:

 naesten@hydrogen:/usr/share/emacs/22.3% find \( -name '*.el' -or -name '*.el.gz' \) -print0 \
 >                                        | xargs -0 file -z | grep -v '\(program\|English\) text'

In addition to the 20 or so files identified as "data", I get one mistaken for a PalmOS application (?!?), one for a Fortran program, and one for a "CLIPPER instruction profile" (whatever that is). (I also get a couple detected as "ASCII text", but that's not wrong.)

(The reason for matching '*.el.gz' in addition to '*.el', and for passing -z to file, is that Debian has most of the elisp sources gzipped.)
