== (Minor) Problem(?) with user names on RecentChanges ==

Click the link for ##José Alfredo Romero L.## on RecentChanges ---e.g. for 2009-11-11, ##13:37 UTC (new) (history) sunrise-x-tabs.el . . . . José Alfredo Romero L. – Added source for the sunrise-x-tabs extension. [en]##

You get to the normal "This page does not exist" page, but the link to create it has this text: <tt>This page does not exist, but you can __[Self:action=edit;id=Jos%c3%a9_Alfredo_Romero_L.__ create it now].</tt> I underlined the link part. -- DrewAdams

[new]
Indeed. Thanks for reporting it. Hopefully fixed. -- AlexSchroeder

== Problems with Download Link ==

I found, now in lisp el page, e.g. http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/tie-mode.el, there have a download button, not a download link, 
but It does not work in IE and firefox browser, I have to first edit page, then copy it. also, I think a download link is better than 
a download button, because we can copy link url easily, then use other download tool, e.g. wget. -- [[ahei]]

[new:DrewAdams:2009-11-04 05:10 UTC]
(Ahei reported this problem on page DoReMi. Dunno why he posted it there, but I moved it here. -- DrewAdams)




== Cannot Download Previous Versions of a File ==

At this page, I click the `Download' link, and I get this message:

  This page does not exist, but you can [Self:action=edit;id=bookmark%20.el create it now].

That's not very helpful. And I don't know how to do what it suggests. I had to click `##Edit this page##' to get to the source code. -- DrewAdams

[new]
Indeed. This was an encoding problem. The plus sign was apparently not encoded, and without encoding the + itself encodes a space. Thus asking for revision 74 of ##bookmark+.el## resulted in an URL that tried to show revision 74 of ##bookmark .el## (the + being replaced with a space).
Hopefully this is fixed, now. -- Alex

[new:DrewAdams:2009-10-16 14:53 UTC]
Thanks. Almost fixed. The file name that shows up in the `##File name:##' field of the `##Save As##' dialog box is this, however: `##emacs.el;raw=1;revision=71##', instead of the name of the file, ##bookmark+.el##. But at least I can modify that text by hand to give it the right name -- and downloading then works. -- DrewAdams



[:StalePagesServed]
== Browser Cache Not Refreshed - Stale Pages Served ==

This might be the same problem as [[#EditingGetsOldPageText]], below, but since that speaks specifically about emacs-w3m, I'm not sure.

This problem started several months ago. The browser cache does not get refreshed when pages are edited and saved. This happens for different browsers.

This problem has bitten several people, and the only workaround seems to be to remember to manually force a cache refresh when, say, you are looking at the editable page. And even that doesn't work if you use the Download link.

This causes people to download the wrong version of a page (e.g. an Emacs Lisp library, using the Download link). And it causes people to accidentally overwrite a previous edit by someone else (since it doesn't appear in the editable text unless they refresh that text).

I know that some people have thought that the problem was that pages were not being locked properly for edits, so that two people editing at the same time could accidentally overwrite each other's edits. I don't know if that problem also exists, but I do know that this cache problem has caused people to think there is a locking problem for edits. The cache problem occurs however, even for an edit that is long after (days after) the last edit has been saved, so it is not a lock problem.

Thanks for looking into this. -- DrewAdams


[new:DrewAdams:2009-11-04 07:10 UTC]
This is still happening, but I still cannot give a recipe for why or when it happens -- it happens sometimes. It just happened now. In the same browser session, I updated page DoReMi and saved. Then opened that page again from the link at RecentChanges, using browser's Open Link in New Window. Then clicked Edit the page and got the old page source, before my edit and save. HTH -- DrewAdams




== Cannot save pages ==

I cannot save page Lisp:icicles-cmd.el (which has been replaced by other files) after replacing the content. I replaced all of the content by ##DeletedPage## and tried to save. I see only a blank page with this URL in the address field: http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs. And the save never took place. I tried saving again, but was told the wiki was locked. I unlocked the wiki and tried again. Same thing. Did this a couple of times. Tried previewing first; still no luck. Apparently it's impossible to save and thus delete the page. 

I then had the same problem trying to save this page, with this new entry. Unlocking the wiki didn't help. Eventually I succeeded in saving this page, after unlocking several times, but I still can't save the updated (DeletedPage) file Lisp:icicles-cmd.el. -- DrewAdams

[new:DrewAdams:2009-05-22 22:26 UTC]
Now I'm seeing the same thing for other files -- e.g. Lisp:icicles-mode.el. The problem is not deleting pages but saving pages. Cannot make a small change and then save it. The save seems to abort (?) -- I just see a blank white browser window, and the page never comes back. And the wiki gets locked. -- DrewAdams

[new]
I'm not sure what causes this. It must be rather new. I wonder whether the host has installed something new or fiddled with the webserver configuration. Right now I cannot reproduce it. :( -- AlexSchroeder

[new:DrewAdams:2009-05-23 14:05 UTC]
It's very simple to reproduce -- in fact, it's impossible not to reproduce. Edit this page (file): Lisp:icicles-cmd.el. Replace all of the code by this: ##DeletedPage##. Try to save. I get the symptom described above or this is displayed:

: The XML page cannot be displayed 
: Cannot view XML input using style sheet. Please correct the error and then click the Refresh button, or try again later. 

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

: The server did not understand the request, or the request was invalid. Error processing resource 'http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtm...

And the wiki becomes locked. Perhaps it has to do with the size of the delta: from a large file down to almost nothing. (I'm splitting the file because a small addition to it made it too large to save.) -- DrewAdams

[new]
I found the following in my cgi-bin/.htaccess file and commented it out:

{{{
# about 50MB should be enough (reading log files and all that)
RLimitMEM 50000000
}}}

Apparently everything seems to work right now. I'm just surprised that
we're hitting a 50MB RAM limit.

In the process of trying to figure out what caused the problem I disabled the elisp fontification.
Does anybody think the fontification of Elisp Code is valuable? I'm inclined
to leave it deactivated. I know I never read source code on the web
pages themselves unless it's very short and embedded into some explanatory text.
The only value of displaying source files at all is to make them visible to search engines, I think. -- AlexSchroeder

[new:DrewAdams:2009-05-23 23:17 UTC]
''Thanks!''

Yes, I sometimes look at a new Lisp page before deciding whether to download it. The fontification helps -- at least for comments and doc strings. But I don't feel strongly about it. Thanks again for the prompt fix. -- DrewAdams

[new]
Fontification is back, as bad as it is. :) -- AlexSchroeder

[new:DrewAdams:2009-05-24 02:22 UTC]
Thx -- DrewAdams



== No Longer See Tooltip for [new:YourName:2009-03-30 21:07 UTC] ==

At least on IE6, Google Chrome, and FireFox, I no longer see a tooltip displayed when I mouseover a [new:YourName:2009-03-30 21:07 UTC] entry. Dunno when this broke. It works only when there is a portrait. -- DrewAdams

[new:Alex:2009-03-31]
I'm not sure what you mean. I'm interpreting that you think it should also work when there is no portrait. But in those cases there is no image to mouseover. Do you think there was a title attribute on the div itself instead of the image in those cases? I don't think that was ever the case. -- AlexSchroeder

[new:DrewAdams:2009-03-31 14:48 UTC]
Yes, I thought so. Maybe I misremember, but I thought that mousing over the shaded area would show the tooltip. Anyway, not important. -- DrewAdams

== Title of Recent-Changes Pages ==

The page title for RecentChanges is still '''%%RecentChanges%%''', but if you click any of the links such as '''Include rollbacks''', '''Include minor changes''', and '''List later changes''', the page title now changes to '''All Changes for SiteMap'''. This is new. And that same (inaccurate) title is used when you click different such links -- it doesn't seem to distinguish anything. -- DrewAdams

[new]
Thanks for spotting this. I'll fix that ASAP. A recent change to the cookie handling code had several unintended consequences that my test suite did not pick up. :) -- AlexSchroeder

[new:DrewAdams:2009-03-16 20:50 UTC]
Thanks for the quick fix. -- DrewAdams

== Visible permanent anchors go only to the page, not to the anchor ==

I thought that this worked before, but perhaps it never worked.  When you follow a link ##[[foobar]]## to a permanent anchor defined using ##[::foobar]##, the URL produced uses ''##<pageURL>##''###foobar##, but that anchor is not the destination, at least in IE 6. Instead, the top of the (destination) page is shown. For example, just open this MyVisibleAnchor link in another window. You will see the top of the page PermanentAnchors, not the part of the page where the anchor is. -- DrewAdams

[new]
Hm. It works for me. Are you sure your browser window is small enough? If your window is big, and the target page is small, then there's no way the browser can "scroll down" to the named anchor. -- AlexSchroeder

== w3m ==

To edit the wiki using [[w3m]] make sure you enable cookies in w3m! Hit ##o## for options and check for the following:

{{{
Cookie Settings

Enable cookie processing                           (*)YES  ( )NO
Print a message when receiving a cookie            (*)YES  ( )NO
Accept cookies                                     (*)YES  ( )NO
}}}

Next, [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/uihnscuskc/SiteMap follow this
link] to set the cookie. This will prevent the reCAPTCHA code from
being triggered.

== emacs-w3m ==

To edit the wiki using [[emacs-w3m]] make sure you enable cookies in
your .emacs!

{{{
(setq w3m-use-cookies t)
}}}

Next, [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/uihnscuskc/SiteMap follow this
link] to set the cookie. This will prevent the reCAPTCHA code from
being triggered.


[:EditingGetsOldPageText]
== editing does not get most recent version ==

I tried yet again to get emacs-w3m to work as described above.  I edited.  It didn't work.  I edited the page with Safari.  It worked.  Then I followed the instructions again in emacs-w3m.  The Safari edit did not show up in the compose edit box, even though the page did show it.  Therefore, the text that the user edits is not the same as the text that is shown.  Is this a cache issue?  Thanks.

[new]
There's some technical information available here, if you want to take a look at it: Oddmuse:Caching. As I'm currently in Costa Rica, I can't help you. All I know is that it worked for me -- and I went through all the trouble of downloading and compiling w3m and dependencies. -- AlexSchroeder

== Browser `Open in New Window' no longer works on wiki pages ==

This has changed in the last day or so -- since the spam attack. 

On EmacsWiki, I can no longer right-click a link (any link) and choose '''Open in New Window'''. I use IE6, and I have Google Toolbar installed (since a long time ago). When I try to open a link in a new window, Google Toolbar treats the attempt as a pop-up and blocks it.

I am forced to duplicate the browser window (`C-n') and then find and click the link. This is very slow, since the current page needs to be reloaded  in the new window even though I'm going to move away from it.

I have this problem only for %%EmacsWiki%% pages, and I have changed nothing in my browser etc.  Does this perhaps have something to do with the change to use [http://recaptcha.net/ reCAPTCHA]? 

This is really quite annoying. I can make the problem go away by choosing '''Popups okay''' for Google Toolbar (for %%EmacsWiki%%), but users shouldn't need to do that. %%EmacsWiki%% appears unfriendly to people with this behavior. -- DrewAdams

[new]
I believe you. Unfortunately I don't know what to do about it. I'm sure your browsing environment will allow you to define exceptions to the popup blocker. -- AlexSchroeder

[new:DrewAdams:2008-09-07 06:27 UTC]
Yes, as I said, I've done that. The point was that it's a shame that users will now need to do that -- some might become discouraged or not understand. What's odd is that I've never seen this (treating '''Open in New Window''' as a popup) on any other site. Anyway, it's not a biggee. And perhaps it affects only IE6 users who happen to use Google Toolbar -- dunno. -- DrewAdams

== .emacs -> InitFile Substitution ==

Recently, "~/.emacs" strings have all been replaced by "InitFile" 
on the wiki pages. This is unfortunate, since non-english wiki pages
are now cluttered with references to the english InitFile page, 
instead of the corresponding
translation. It would have been better to make the substitution on the
english pages only, and let each locale deal with the problem 
in the appropriate way. Or better, just leave the ~/.emacs references, 
which do not depend on the locale.

== Search loses Username ==

I searched for "viper", then clicked ViperMode. I edited the page, and my name was lost from the Username field (didn't notice at the time). -- DrewAdams

== RecentChanges doesn't reflect recent changes ==

I just edited and saved a reply someone posted at DrewsElispLibraries. I refrefreshed RecentChanges (with rollbacks and minor changes included), but my edit does not appear. That wiki page is listed, but still at the time and user of the previous edit. However, after clicking List only major changes it was listed. I had previously cleared my cache, so I don't think that was the problem. I'm guessing it was a cache problem nevertheless, but thought I'd mention it, in case it's not. -- DrewAdams

== Rogue file in Elisp area ==

I noticed by accident that there is a file Lisp:find-dired++.el listed in the Elisp area. But clicking on it brings up a blank page -- no header, nothing. I imagine that it can be deleted, but I don't know how to delete it. (Please don't delete the similarly named <tt>[[find-dired+.el]]</tt>.) -- DrewAdams

== Saving EmacsLisp file changes its name ==

I go to ##http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/## type ##help+20.el## at the end, hit return, and it says that it is at page ##help+20.el##, as I expect. I edit (create) the page, which contains a Lisp library. I save. The page was renamed to ##help 20.el## (with a space). That name is useless, and it doesn't correspond to the library name. 

This is a new problem. I have other libraries (e.g. Lisp:compile+20.el) that I created similarly. This is a problem for me. -- DrewAdams

[new:DrewAdams:2007-12-14 17:42 UTC]
I was able to work around the bug, by seeing what the URL for editing Lisp:compile+20.el is and using a similar URL to edit (create) Lisp:help+20.el.  The bug is that when you try to edit the new page, the URL does not use ##%2b## in place of ##+##, so it effectively renames the page, replacing a ##+## with a space character. -- DrewAdams

[new]
I think there is nothing I can do about it. In URL keywords and parameters, the + does in fact encode a space. Repeat the same procedure but use a question mark at the end: ##http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki?## -- you'll see that you will end up on ##help 20.el## instead! The only safe way to create a page is by creating a link to the page first, and then following the link. Theoretically you have the same problem with non-ASCII characters. Assume you type an URL containing "Schröder" into the address bar of your newly started browser. Since the standard says you have to encode the ö, and since you haven't visited an page yet, the browser must guess the encoding system. But every website is free to pick Latin-1, UTF-8, Shift-JIS, or any other encoding system. There's no way for the browser to do the right thing as long as the user is allowed to type the URL directly.

That's why I think this is not worth fixing. If creating a link to the new page and following the link does not work for you, then it's a bug. Until then... it's an artifact of the exposure of low-level infrastructure using tricky protocols to humans. It works 80% of the time if you're an English speaker, but I'm not going to encourage anybody to do it. -- AlexSchroeder

[new:DrewAdams:2007-12-16 00:22 UTC]
OK, thanks for the explanation. That works for me. I wonder if there might be some (easy) way to let someone know that the saved name changed (or will change, before you save?). If there's no easy way to do that, don't worry about it; I understand what you're saying. Thx -- DrewAdams

[new:DrewAdams:2007-12-25 23:10 UTC]
FWIW -- Using the '''Edit this page''' link at the page bottom does not manifest the problem. It is only the '''create it now''' link that has the problem. -- DrewAdams

[new]
Hopefully fixed now. Thanks for spotting it. -- AlexSchroeder

== Upload ==

Tried to upload a tar.gz file (consisting of linkd.el & its associated icons) and got the error "Files of type application/gzip are not allowed." Do I really have to find somewhere else for this? -- ShaunJohnson

[new]
Check out Self:action=mimetypes for the supported ones. I added more to that list. -- Alex

[new]
Thanks, works fine now. -- ShaunJohnson.

== Search lists non-English pages in English ==

I searched for "##helpplus##".  I got hits such as this:

* EmacsWiki: HelpPlusHelpPlus · DrewAdams has written library help+.el, which provides various enhancements to the help that is built into Emacs. This library works with Emacs ...
www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs-fr/HelpPlus - 14k - Cached 

* EmacsWiki: HelpFnsPlusHelpModePlus – extensions to standard library ‘help-mode’; HelpMenuBarPlus – extensions to the MenuBar Help menu; HelpPlus – similar to Lisp:help-fns+.el, ...
www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs-se/HelpFnsPlus - 9k - Cached 

It's not obvious that these pages are accessed in French and Swedish, since the text is in English. I guess you need to notice the `##-fr##' and `##-se##' in the URLs. I visited the second one, didn't notice anything special at first, and then was surprised to see "Redigera sidan" in place of "Edit this page".

Perhaps we need a third radio button for Search that will find only pages in the current language (and that would be the default). Maybe this problem is not new, but I never noticed it before -- perhaps because of the way search hits are now sorted (?). 

BTW -- How to get to the corresponding English page from a non-English page? And how to get back into English once the pages are coming up in some other language? -- DrewAdams

[new]
Right now Emacs Wiki has two ways to determine the interface language: The URL if you use ##/cgi-bin/emacs-XX## where XX is a language code, or your browser language preferences if you use ##/cgi-bin/emacs## or ##/cgi-bin/wiki##. On http://www.oddmuse.org/ I've been testing a different implementation that relies on cookies. Maybe I'll install it for EmacsWiki as well. Alternatively we figure out how Google identifies the language of a page, or figure out what language Google is asking for (assuming a French googlebot is actually requesting French pages)... Or we figure out a way to tell Google what the "canonical" page is... Now that we're tied more intimately to Google we're realizing that not all problems have gone away. :) -- Alex

[new:DrewAdams:2007-11-23 01:31 UTC]
Yeah, I kinda figured this was due to the switch to Google. I hope a solution can be found, since search is important and the move to Google is otherwise a great improvement. -- DrewAdams

[new:DrewAdams:2007-12-08 17:42 UTC]
Still hoping this can be fixed. We've lost an important functionality (while gaining another with Google search). -- DrewAdams

[new:AlexSchroeder:2007-12-09 09:49 UTC]
I guess one solution would be to only index pages whose URL ends in "wiki", meaning that the interface language will be determined by the user once he clicks on the link. I'll try that and we'll see how good it is. -- AlexSchroeder

[new:DrewAdams:2007-12-15 19:28 UTC]
Seems to fix it. Haven't yet noticed any drawbacks. Thanks. -- DrewAdams

== TOC heading in wrong language ==

At TreeMode (http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/TreeMode), the page is in English, but the TOC title is in Chinese. -- DrewAdams.

== Image Files Not Displayed ==

Some image files are consistently not displayed. I don't know if it is my browser only, but, for example, the first 3 images at this page are not displayed in line: http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/Icicles_-_Customization_and_General_Tips. I see only an X and a link with the name of the image page. Refreshing the browser has no effect. If I visit that image page by clicking the link, the image is shown, and it is presumably then in my browser cache. However, refreshing the first-mentioned page still does not show the images. Similarly, some (7) images are not shown on this page: http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/Icicles_-_Screenshots. All of the image files are present and can be shown by clicking the missing-image link. This seems to be a recent problem. Could it be related to anti-spam changes? -- DrewAdams

[new:DrewAdams:2007-11-05 02:29 UTC]
I don't think it's a browser problem. I see the same thing, with the same image files, in both FireFox and IE6. I suspect it's an EmacsWiki problem. -- DrewAdams

[new] Hm... The page is still there but the static copy has disappeared from http://www.emacswiki.org/pics/static/... How annoying.
I think the problem is that I allowed a new MIME type (image/x-png) without specifying that the file extension for this page was going to be PNG. Recently I discovered this error and fixed it because I suspected it to be the cause of a different error. The fix now requires the extension that files uploaded in a certain time window don't have. I'll fix those manually. Please report any that are still missing. At the moment I fixed the following: IciclesKeyCompletionsSortByCmdName IciclesKeyCompletionsSortLocalFirst IciclesKeyCompletionsSortPrefixFirst DrewsEmacsColorNameCompletions DrewsEmacsIciclesFaces DrewsEmacsIciclesOptionsCustomizeMenu DrewsEmacsIciclesOptionsMenu DrewsEmacsPseudoColorCompletions. -- AlexSchroeder

[new:DrewAdams:2007-11-05 15:38 UTC]
Thanks very much, Alex. I'll let you know if I find any others. BTW, I noticed that some image pages (e.g. DrewsEmacsSSMinibuff) have some automatic text in German, but that's not a problem. -- DrewAdams

== Markup of `RET C-i' ==

Why doesn't the quoted markup of `RET C-i' work?  `RET' works. -- AaronHawley

[new]
At the very end of the [http://emacswiki.org/emacs/config config file] you can see the rule I'm using:

         /\G(\`|‘)([CM][- ][- A-Za-z0-9<>;:#]+)(\'|’)/cg
      or /\G(\`|‘)([-A-Za-z0-9\/\*]+[=]?)(\'|’)/cg

I think the first regexp matches keys and the second matches symbols. Thus `RET' works because it looks like a symbol. The tricky part is coming up with something that doesn't cause false positives... Untested suggestion...

         /\G(\`|‘)(([CM][- ][- A-Za-z0-9<>;:#]+|RET|TAB|DEL|<(tab|f[0-9]+)>) ?)+(\'|’)/cg

-- AlexSchroeder

[new]
Alright, I'll just use `C-m C-i'.  I'll have to try and find time to investigate the consequences of changing that regexp, though. -- AaronHawley

== both www.emacsen.org and emacsen.org work without one redirecting to the other ==

This might not be the best setup, Google-juice-wise. Permanently redirecting from one to the other seems like the way to go.

Additionally, even with a domain, pages lack a canonical URI; ##/cgi-bin/emacs/foo##, ##/cgi-bin/emacs-en/foo##, and ##/cgi-bin/wiki/foo## all work. I suggest redirecting all of those to ##/wiki/foo##.

== emacswiki and w3m ==

EmacsWiki doesnt appear to work well with w3m, specifically the search button. --JoakimVerona

Try this solution, been using it a while now --[[pft]]:

   (define-key w3m-mode-map "\C-c\C-c" 
     '(lambda ()
        (interactive)
        (if (member 'w3m-href-anchor (text-properties-at (point)))
            (w3m-view-this-url)
          (w3m-submit-form))))

== Winky emoticon displayed instead of &amp; ==

[new]
When an ampersand happens to be surrounded by parentheses the wiki returns
the following:

    (&amp<img src="/pics/blink.png" alt=";)">

(&)

It seems that smilies are converted after unsafe characters.  Note that this
doesn't happen when it is escaped as code.

This bug was noticed on SampleWikiModeSetup. -- DianeMurray

[new]
Indeed: ##&)## -> &).  Wierd. -- AaronHawley

[new]
Hm yes, must be a problem with the ordering of the rules: After HTML escaping (which I do),
there is in fact a ##;)## in the source text.  I wonder why the ##&amp;## doesn't get
rendered first... -- AlexSchroeder

== Connection broken when uploading Elisp files ==

I can't upload files via the "replace this text with a file" link. After clicking the Save button, I get the error "The document contains no data" in Firefox 1.0.7 and "An error occurred while loading http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki: Connection to host www.emacswiki.org is broken" in Konqueror 3.4.1. Is anyone else getting this? --TobyCubitt

Update: I have the same problem under windows, using both Firefox and IE.
-- TobyCubitt

[new]
Any news on this issue? -- AlexSchroeder

[new]
2006-10-06 For me its the same as Toby describes (Firfox 1.0.8 under Fedora and IE under Windows).

Update 2006-10-14: My file seems too big, the wiki program blocked any furhter editing.  Alex Schroeder had to remove it by hand and uploaded a compressed version. -- [[dida]]

== Problem with Google search ==

[new] If you search for the word "sticky" you do not find the page StickyModifiers, but that word is on that page. -- LennartBorgman
[new] hmm searching  for "sticky site:.emacswiki.org" google find thse page with the url: www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs-en/StickyModifiers, maybe it's just a problem of adding a couple more url in the custom search  -- PierreGaston 
[new] I added ##http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs-*## to the list of sites. Previously the site list contained only ##http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/*##. I think the real problem is that I would want all the URLs matching ##http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs-*## to be registered as ##http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki##. Ah the joys of fiddling with search engines. :) -- AlexSchroeder
[new] Thanks! -- LennartBorgman
[new] Is there something magic with StickyModifiers (except that it saves you)? You can't search for StickyModifiers now. Or for "sticky modifiers". Anyone understands this? -- LennartBorgman
[new] I set my search languages to Chinese in google search preferences, so when I search in emacswiki.org, only a few pages can be found, can I just search all languages in emacswiki.org without change my google preferences? Or in the page of search result provides a radio button to select language.  
-- [[Ye_Wenbin]]

== Page names not split apart correctly in titles ==

EmacsWiki's title names are being split so that the search functionality works even when a word is mentioned only in a page's title.  The splitting is not quite correct, though, as neighboring capital letters aren't split apart.  Here a couple examples:

* HowToSetUpSemanticBovinatorForANewLanguage becomes "!EmacsWiki: How To Set Up Semantic Bovinator For ANew Language"

* WThreeMEditingWikis becomes "!EmacsWiki: WThree MEditing Wikis" ("W Three M Editing Wikis" would look odd as well but should be easier to read)

I think that these names don't lend themselves to typical wiki-style linking anyway. They should be renamed to [[How To Set Up Semantic Bovinator For A New Language]] and [[w3m Editing Wikis]] or whatever seems appropriate. For titles that are not just two or three ordinary words smashed together, wiki-style names are a poor choice, and therefore I think my time is better spent elsewhere. If we fix this, there will always be another example showing that it isn't perfect.

If anybody else is interested in suggesting a solution, here's the code:

 $str =~ s/([[:lower:]])([[:upper:]])/$1 $2/g;

It can't get perfect, but something like this might be useable:

 $str =~ s/([^ ])([[:upper:]][[:lower:]])/$1 $2/g;
 $str =~ s/([^ ])([[:upper:]][[:lower:]])/$1 $2/g;
 $str =~ s/([[:lower:]])A /$1 A /g;

== Some files/wiki packages are broken ==

The files multi-eshell.el and planner-hierarchy.el and their respective wiki pages are broken. The wiki pages don't feature a download button and the lisp code is not htmlized. The elisp files contain some non-lisp blob at the beginning and end.

I was able to fix a similar problem for gosh.el by simply removing the mess, but this did not work for the other mentioned files.

The site expects elisp files to start with three semicolons (##;;;##). See [[Manual:Library Headers]] ("The very first line should have this format: ##;;; FILENAME --- DESCRIPTION##"). I will add the missing semicolon. -- AlexSchroeder

== RSS for single-pages doesn't work in Google Reader ==

I haven't figured out what the problem is yet, but I added http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/?action=rss;rcidonly=IciclesDiscussion to Google Reader, and it didn't get a "new item" notification when the page was changed. -- EthanGlasserCamp

[new]
When I look at the RSS feed, I get to see the latest revision of the page. I must therefore assume that it's Google Reader's fault. I can imagine two problems: 1. It takes very long for changes to be picked up by Google. That's the explanation I currently favor because I have several of my own wikis in Google Reader and I often have the impression that Google Reader is up to a day late. 2. Google Reader thinks that you're looking at an update to an existing page and will not show it anymore. I remember there was such an option for Blog Lines, but I can't find anything like it for Google Reader. -- AlexSchroeder

== File type "data" ==

file (see man file) returns "Lisp/Scheme program text" for most of the hosted libraries. However for Lisp:cscope.el, Lisp:less.el, Lisp:php-completion.el and Lisp:rcirc.el it returns "data". The files look okay at first glance. Might there be a problem with encoding? What else? Could this possibly be fixed by simply editing and resaving these files? The page BuildingEmacsWithMinGW is also reported as "data". This problem occurs regardless whether I download the file manually or get it using the subversion mirror.  -- JonasBernoulli

== Empty files in subversion mirror ==

The subversion repository contains two empty pages:  DavidSpreen and ScreencastProductions. As you can see they don't exist anymore on the wiki. Alex, please remove these. -- JonasBernoulli
