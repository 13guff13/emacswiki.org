==RSS feed shows diff of major change, but summary line from last minor change==

I made 2 changes to IndentationBasics, http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=history;id=IndentationBasics, revisions 36 (major) and 37 (minor). In the [Self:action=rss;full=1;diff=1;page=0 Recent changes RSS with diffs] I see the diff for revision 36 (which is good, because it's the major change), but the summary line for 37 (which is bad, because it's just "fix typo").

[new:AlexSchroeder:2015-07-13 09:29 UTC]
Thanks, fixed!

==RandomPage==

This is not working.

The http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=random link always takes me to PaulKinnucan

[new]
I guess that's because you're getting the cached random page. :)

Perhaps it's time to retire the Random Page. Do you regularly click the Random Page link?

-- Alex Schroeder

[new]

It is not a cached page, as I get the same thing from different computers on different networks.

I do use the random page from time to time to help me discover things I didn't know about emacs. It has come in use quite a few times. I really like having it.

BTW: I had a hard time adding this comments because a few times the edit showed the previous version of the page, and I had to go into a Linux VM and for some reason that worked.

== Revisioning Problems ==

[:EditingGetsOldPageText]
=== editing does not get most recent version ===

I tried yet again to get emacs-w3m to work as described above.  I edited.  It didn't work.  I edited the page with Safari.  It worked.  Then I followed the instructions again in emacs-w3m.  The Safari edit did not show up in the compose edit box, even though the page did show it.  Therefore, the text that the user edits is not the same as the text that is shown.  Is this a cache issue?  Thanks.

[new]
There's some technical information available here, if you want to take a look at it: Oddmuse:Caching. As I'm currently in Costa Rica, I can't help you. All I know is that it worked for me -- and I went through all the trouble of downloading and compiling w3m and dependencies. -- AlexSchroeder

=== RecentChanges doesn't reflect recent changes ===

I just edited and saved a reply someone posted at DrewsElispLibraries. I refrefreshed RecentChanges (with rollbacks and minor changes included), but my edit does not appear. That wiki page is listed, but still at the time and user of the previous edit. However, after clicking List only major changes it was listed. I had previously cleared my cache, so I don't think that was the problem. I'm guessing it was a cache problem nevertheless, but thought I'd mention it, in case it's not. -- DrewAdams

=== Invisible change ===

[new]
Someone edited [[Emacsmirror]] months ago but the change is not visible on the page. When I edit the page I can see the added text.  I haven't tried yet what happens when I save the page.  Maybe that would cause the old edit to become effective but I wanted to leave it as-is so you can see for yourself. -- JonasBernoulli

[new]
Hm, I'm not sure. When [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Emacsmirror?cache=0 using the cache=0 parameter] the page doesn't mention "solarized" so I think editing the page will not make a big change. I wonder where the diff comes from, however.





== Markup/Generation Issues==

=== Gist not shown ===

I tried to include a code fragment as gist on the page GermanLaTeXQuotes, which is not displayed. Instead of the gist the code is shown. It seems that the link includes the terminating quote character which is obviously not correct. The working gist on page [[Gists]] only includes numeric characters while my links also has alphanumeric characters. Maybe a problem with the code that validates a correct gist link? -- StefanMoeding

=== Colon line prefix does not indent correctly ===

See [[UnicodeEncoding#ucs-cmds.el]].  No matter how many colons are used for the last paragraph, it does not indent more.  We should be able to have ##::## align more or less with ##**## etc.  This is a regression.  -- DrewAdams

[new]
I think the problem is that the HTML being generated right now is invalid: ##<dl class="quote"><dl class="quote"><dt /><dd>indent 2</dd></dl></dl>## -- I don't think this ever worked as you intended it to. Right now you need to use ##:## before you can use ##::##. -- AlexSchroeder


[new]
I'm pretty sure it used to work.  I guess you're saying that a workaround is to do this?

{{{
* A bullet entry

:  

:: Some text indented to be under the bullet.
}}}


That does seem to work.  (You need to put some spaces after the `:'.)

* A bullet entry

:  

:: Some text indented to be under the bullet.

I guess I'm OK with the workaround, though it indents too far and adds too much vertical whitespace.
You can remove this problem unless you want to keep it as a reminder to look for a better solution.

[new]
I guess if the following two don't line up exactly, we can use some CSS fix it:

* bullet
: indent

I'm assuming that the exact indentation is determined by the browser defaults.
On my iPad it looks as follows:

{{{
normal text

   • bullet
   indent
}}}

The variant you prefer would be this, correct?

{{{
normal text

 • bullet
   indent
}}}

-- Alex 



=== Can markup be used in headers? <code>I have failed to do so.</code> ===
Is this documented somewhere?

Use-case: putting a category-tag like <code>CategoryNeedsAttention</code> into a header, without actually invoking it.

Interestingly, the markup in this particular header renders properly in the TOC

[new]
Markup cannot be nested by default. Very few markup elements can in fact be nested. This is not document anywhere, I think.
Common sense stuff like list items and inline markup can be nested (bold list items, for example).
Emphasis markup using apostrophes is the online inline markup that can be nested: ##''italic '''bold''' and italic''## -> ''italic '''bold''' and italic''. -- AlexSchroeder

[new]
The irony being that markup in headers **is** rendered in the (javascript-built) TOC -- MichaelPaulukonis



=== Apostrophes etc. not prettified in links ==

* ##ain't -- it -- "nice"## => ain't -- it -- "nice"
* ##[EmacsWikiProblems ain't -- it -- "nice"]## => [EmacsWikiProblems ain't -- it -- "nice"]

The link text retains its crude ASCII formatting. -- VegardOye

=== Braces not allowed in links ===

I tried to put braces in a url (because the stupid url required them), eg:

{{{
https://www.heathrowconnect.com/index.asp?SID={65C76CDC-2EFD-4589-A223-809157EAA164}
}}}

I tried a few different things, eg:

{{{
[[https://www.heathrowconnect.com/index.asp?SID={65C76CDC-2EFD-4589-A223-809157EAA164}|Blah]]
}}}

none of them worked. I think this *should* be ok.

Again though, I'm happy with it not being fixed because we'll fix it with Elwiki.

[new]
If you read RFC 2396 you'll note that curly braces are deemed "unwise" in section
2.4.3. Excluded US-ASCII Characters.




== Server Issues ==

=== Site is very slow now ===

Takes me several minutes to load the Elisp Area page -- or else it hangs altogether (times out). Likewise to get to one of the Lisp files there.  Likewise, it takes a long time to preview (e.g. this edit).  And yes, I tried closing the browser and deleting the cache. -- DrewAdams

[new]
Is this happening to anybody else? What about the time? Whenever I use the site, it seems to be working just fine. -- AlexSchroeder


=== CGI Internal error: 400 Bad request (malformed multipart POST) ===

I just got this error when trying to save a page after some simple (trivial) editing.  No idea what caused it or what the problem is.  I then clicked the browser `Back' button and tried, successfully, to save again.  -- DrewAdams

[new]
Anybody else? I've never seen this before. -- AlexSchroeder

[new]
Just an FYI that this problem has not disappeared, even if it is less frequent. -- DrewAdams





== Client Issues ==

In some cases the server might actually be at fault - still makes sense to group them like this.

[:StalePagesServed]
=== Browser Cache Not Refreshed - Stale Pages Served ===

This might be the same problem as [[#EditingGetsOldPageText]], below, but since that speaks specifically about emacs-w3m, I'm not sure.

This problem started several months ago. The browser cache does not get refreshed when pages are edited and saved. This happens for different browsers.

This problem has bitten several people, and the only workaround seems to be to remember to manually force a cache refresh when, say, you are looking at the editable page. And even that doesn't work if you use the Download link.

This causes people to download the wrong version of a page (e.g. an Emacs Lisp library, using the Download link). And it causes people to accidentally overwrite a previous edit by someone else (since it doesn't appear in the editable text unless they refresh that text).

I know that some people have thought that the problem was that pages were not being locked properly for edits, so that two people editing at the same time could accidentally overwrite each other's edits. I don't know if that problem also exists, but I do know that this cache problem has caused people to think there is a locking problem for edits. The cache problem occurs however, even for an edit that is long after (days after) the last edit has been saved, so it is not a lock problem.

Thanks for looking into this. -- DrewAdams


[new:DrewAdams:2009-11-04 07:10 UTC]
This is still happening, but I still cannot give a recipe for why or when it happens -- it happens sometimes. It just happened now. In the same browser session, I updated page DoReMi and saved. Then opened that page again from the link at RecentChanges, using browser's Open Link in New Window. Then clicked Edit the page and got the old page source, before my edit and save. HTH -- DrewAdams


[new:DrewAdams:2010-02-04 01:35 UTC]
Some more info on this, in case it helps. I was just bitten by this again -- I had to redo a bunch of edits as a result. 

If you look at the revisions of BookmarkPlus between Revision 53 and Revision 58, you'll see that Revision 54 was a major edit, then 55 was a minor edit. Well, 55 did not use 54 as its starting point -- it used 53 instead. So I ended up doing 55, 56, 57, and 58, before I realized that the major edit for 54 had been undone (i.e. lost).

I used to think this problem had something to do with the browser cache, but now I'm thinking it has something to do with major and minor edits. HTH. -- DrewAdams


[new:DrewAdams:2010-03-22 17:24 UTC]
Dunno if this is strictly related to the browser cache problem that I've been assuming exists, but there is a fine example of losing page updates that just occurred. See the revisions of this very page, EmacsWikiProblems, today.

You'll see that this sequence of events took place:

# I updated the page to reply to SteveTaylor about the mistaken rollback: revision 608.
# VegardOye updated the page to add a new item: revision 609.

Vegard's update wiped out my previous update. -- DrewAdams

[new]
Hm, maybe this is unrelated. Possibly it just took him more than nine minutes to edit the page before he saved it? Perhaps diff3 will sometimes merge things and drop changes without marking them as a conflict? Or he used a raw client that interacts with the wiki text directly, didn't post back the last modification date, thus diff3 was unable to determine the ancestor for conflict resolution, and he ended up overwriting what you had done. I think the caching problem you reported earlier is something else (and much trickier, apparently). -- AlexSchroeder

=== Browser `Open in New Window' no longer works on wiki pages ===

This has changed in the last day or so -- since the spam attack. 

On EmacsWiki, I can no longer right-click a link (any link) and choose '''Open in New Window'''. I use IE6, and I have Google Toolbar installed (since a long time ago). When I try to open a link in a new window, Google Toolbar treats the attempt as a pop-up and blocks it.

I am forced to duplicate the browser window (`C-n') and then find and click the link. This is very slow, since the current page needs to be reloaded  in the new window even though I'm going to move away from it.

I have this problem only for %%EmacsWiki%% pages, and I have changed nothing in my browser etc.  Does this perhaps have something to do with the change to use [http://recaptcha.net/ reCAPTCHA]? 

This is really quite annoying. I can make the problem go away by choosing '''Popups okay''' for Google Toolbar (for %%EmacsWiki%%), but users shouldn't need to do that. %%EmacsWiki%% appears unfriendly to people with this behavior. -- DrewAdams

[new]
I believe you. Unfortunately I don't know what to do about it. I'm sure your browsing environment will allow you to define exceptions to the popup blocker. -- AlexSchroeder

[new:DrewAdams:2008-09-07 06:27 UTC]
Yes, as I said, I've done that. The point was that it's a shame that users will now need to do that -- some might become discouraged or not understand. What's odd is that I've never seen this (treating '''Open in New Window''' as a popup) on any other site. Anyway, it's not a biggee. And perhaps it affects only IE6 users who happen to use Google Toolbar -- dunno. -- DrewAdams



== Missing table of contents ==

My understanding is that the TOC should be auto-generated.

This works fine on some pages (e.g. OddmuseMode )

But is missing completely on others (e.g. TrampMode (and *this* page, in fact))

[new]
A while back there was a change: these days, the TOC is generated by Javascript (##/outliner.0.5.0.62-toc.js##).
I'm assuming what you sees depends on the age of the page.
If it was last edited before the change, the TOC is part of the cached HTML and you can still see it.
If it was last edited after the change, the TOC has been removed from the cached HTML by previous contributors and the Javascript ought to recreate it for you. Perhaps you have disabled Javascript?
-- AlexSchroeder

[new]
Yes, I usually browse with Javascript off (Firefox + Noscript). Good to know that's the workaround. It's a shame the inline TOC was disabled. Was it still buggy? (I gathered from other discussions that there were some problems with it at some stage.)

[new]
I guess it worked most of the time, but at the same time it was very /brittle/ and required constant attention and compatibility cross-checking. I feel it's just not worth the effort. Perhaps we can improve the wiki for noscript users and add some explanatory text and instructions for how to selectively enable scripts.

The DuckDuckGo search also uses JavaScript to quietly add //site:www.emacswiki.org// to the search terms. Without JavaScript, this will also look weird. -- AlexSchroeder





== Wiki hacked ==
At the moment every page comes with the following line before the title: "Iran, Victory of the Islamic Revolution in Iran". Aside from being pretty old news, I think it may be a sign that someone is messing with this wiki. Please admins do something about it, thanks. Tue Feb 11 07:06:14 CET 2014

[new:AlexSchroeder:2014-02-11 07:12 UTC]
The header of this wiki usually shows national days. This includes messages such as “Iran, Victory of the Islamic Revolution in Iran.” This is not a statement on current events. It just reminds us of the vast diversity of culture on this planet. It's also a great opportunity to learn about other countries and the events that shaped them. Check out the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution Iranian Revolution] on Wikipedia, for example.


== Captcha problems ==
If javascript is disabled, the captcha used on EmacsWiki, is virtually impossible for normal humans to solve on the first, second, or tenth attempt.  reCaptcha might pretend to work without js, but it's too frustrating to bother.  You may as well just disable anonymous edits for non-js users (like those using Emacs, say).

[new:AlexSchroeder:2014-07-15 21:20 UTC]
I can offer two solutions: 1. if you are using a browser that stores cookies, you can provide a "secret" URL parameter that tells Emacs Wiki that you have already answered the CAPTCHA: ##uihnscuskc=1##. 2. Switch to one of the Oddmuse modes listed on CategoryOddmuse. I recommend OddmuseCurl because that's what I use. It also serves as an example of how to use the wiki using ##curl##.


== Spam filter problems ==
[new:PhilHudson:2015-03-16 16:04 UTC]
Vexatious false positive: I've just been prevented from posting because of somebody else's pre-existing, unchanged content, in a different part of the page, that failed the two-bare-urls test. The filter needs to look only at changed/new text, if possible, I think. Either that or the error message should say "go ahead and delete the bad stuff". (The page was [[Nxhtml]].)
[new:AlexSchroeder:2015-03-18 07:36 UTC]
This makes sense. I've added the following: "If you just tried to edit an existing page, this means that you have stumbled upon a page that already contains suspicious text. Please go back and delete or rewrite the suspicious text as well. I'm sorry for the inconvenience!" -- Alex
