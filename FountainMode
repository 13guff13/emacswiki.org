Fountain Mode is a full-featured screenwriting environment using the Fountain markup format. For more information on
the Fountain markup format, visit http://fountain.io/. Fountain Mode is created and maintained by PaulRankin.

== Features ==

* support for the Fountain 1.1 specification (scene numbers and dual dialog are forthcoming)
* Auto-align elements for a kind of WYSIWYG (display only, does not modify file contents)
* Integration with `outline` to toggle visibility of sections and scenes (not yet available in stable release, see below)
* exporting to HTML and PDF (requires [http://www.princexml.com/ Prince])
* include or omit a title page
* multiple levels of syntax highlighting for all elements (see below)
* add/remove continued dialog to successively speaking characters
* `occur` navigator for section headings, synopses, notes and scene
  headings
* templates for inserting synopses, notes and metadata
* navigate by scene heading and character
* support for emphasis (bold, italic, underlined text)
* toggle visibility of emphasis delimiters and escaping characters
* standard commenting (boneyard) behaviour
* everything is customizable, of course

The following features are not yet supported:

* dual dialogue
* scene numbers

Most common features are accessible from the menu. For a full list of
functions and key-bindings, type ##C-h m##. Bugs and feature requests
are encouraged on the GitHub [https://github.com/rnkn/fountain-mode/issues/ Issues] page, or you can email me
directly (email in the source code header).

== Requirements ==

* Emacs 24 (not tested on earlier versions, only tested on Mac OS X
  and Linux, not tested on Windows).
* [https://github.com/magnars/s.el s.el], the long lost Emacs string manipulation library.
* Exporting to PDF requires [http://www.princexml.com/ Prince], which is free for personal
  use. Prince adds a removable PDF annotation on the first page; if
  you don't like it, delete the annotation in a PDF application that
  supports editing annotations, or open the PDF and print to PDF,
  which will remove all annotations.
* to insert UUIDs (useful for using notes as linked bookmarks) you'll
  need either ##uuidgen## CLT (usually pre-installed on OS X and Linux)
  or [https://github.com/nicferrier/emacs-uuid uuid.el] Emacs package.

== Installation ==

Fountain Mode is available through [http://melpa.milkbox.net MELPA]

Alternately, download from [https://github.com/rnkn/fountain-mode GitHub] and put ##fountain-mode.el##, ##fountain-export.el## and ##s.el## in your ##load-path## and
add the following line to your ##.emacs## or ##init.el## file:

    (require 'fountain-mode)

To load Fountain Mode whenever you open a ##.fountain## file, also add the
following:

    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.fountain$" . fountain-mode))

== Outlining ==

There are six possible levels of outline subtrees. Section headings count as the first five levels and scene headings count as the sixth level, e.g.:

    # section level 1
    ## section level 2
    ### section level 3
    #### section level 4
    ##### section level 5
    ###### invalid section level
    INT. LEVEL 6 - DAY
    
    An obese man (40s) with a large mustard stain on his shirt exits the
    elevator. He holds a hotdog.

Cycle subtree visibility with TAB. Cycle global outline visibility with <backtab> (shift-TAB) or C-u TAB.

== Syntax Highlighting ==

To change the level of syntax highlighting, customize the value of
##font-lock-maximum-decoration##. This can be set indirectly with the
menu, or with ##M-x fountain-set-font-lock-decoration## and saved with
##M-x fountain-save-font-lock-decoration##.
