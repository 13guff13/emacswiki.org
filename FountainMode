Fountain Mode aims to be a full-featured screenwriting environment for GNU Emacs using the Fountain markup format. For more information on the Fountain markup format, visit http://fountain.io.

== Features ==

* Support for most of the Fountain 1.1 specification (scene numbers and dual dialog are forthcoming)
* Auto-align elements for a kind of WYSIWYG (display only, does not modify file contents)
* Integration with <code>outline</code> to toggle visibility of sections and scenes
* Export to HTML and PDF (PDF export requires [http://www.princexml.com Prince])
* Include or omit a title page
* Navigate by scene heading
* Emphasis (bold, italic, underlined text)
* Toggle visibility of emphasis delimiters and syntax characters
* Multiple levels of syntax highlighting for all elements
* Add/remove automatic “(CONT’D)” to successively speaking characters
* Automatic “(MORE)” and “(CONT’D)” when breaking dialog across pages in PDF output
* Templates for inserting synopses, notes and metadata
* Support for both official and legacy commenting (boneyard) syntax
* Navigator (using <code>occur</code>) for section headings, synopses, notes and scene headings
* everything is customizable, of course

The following features are not ''yet'' supported:

* scene numbers
* dual dialog

Most common features are accessible from the menu. For a full list of functions and key-bindings, type <code>C-h m</code>.

See the [https://github.com/rnkn/fountain-mode/wiki Wiki] on GitHub for ways to extend Fountain Mode.

== Requirements ==

* Emacs 24.4
* [https://github.com/magnars/s.el s.el], the long lost Emacs string manipulation library.
* Exporting to PDF requires [http://www.princexml.com Prince], which is free for personal use. Prince adds a removable PDF annotation on the first page; if you don’t like it, delete the annotation in a PDF application that supports editing annotations, or open the PDF and print to PDF, which will remove all annotations.
* If you want to use UUIDs (useful for using notes as linked bookmarks) you’ll need either <code>uuidgen</code> CLT (usually preinstalled on OS X and Linux) or [https://github.com/nicferrier/emacs-uuid uuid.el] Emacs package.

== Installation ==

''For users on OS X with no experience with Emacs, see the [https://github.com/rnkn/fountain-mode/wiki/Absolute-Beginner's-Guide-(OS-X) Absolute Beginner’s Guide (OS X)].''

Fountain Mode is available through [http://melpa.org MELPA] and [http://stable.melpa.org MELPA-stable]. I encourage installing the stable version.

Alternately, download the [https://github.com/rnkn/fountain-mode/releases/latest latest release], move the files into your <code>load-path</code> and add the following line to your <code>.emacs</code> or <code>init.el</code> file:
<pre>
(require 'fountain-mode)
</pre>
If you want to use the <code>develop</code> branch (not recommended) to stay on the bleeding-edge, clone the repository in your <code>load-path</code> and require as above:
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/rnkn/fountain-mode.git
</pre>
To load Fountain Mode whenever you open a <code>.fountain</code> file, also add the following:
<pre>
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.fountain$" . fountain-mode))
</pre>
== Outlining ==

There are six possible levels of outline subtrees. Section headings count as the first five levels and scene headings count as the sixth level, e.g.:

<pre>
# section level 1
## section level 2
### section level 3
#### section level 4
##### section level 5
###### invalid section level
INT. LEVEL 6 - DAY

An obese man (40s) with a large mustard stain on his shirt exits the
elevator. He holds a hotdog.
</pre>
Cycle subtree visibility with <code>TAB</code>. Cycle global outline visibility with <code><backtab></code> (shift-TAB) or <code>C-u TAB</code>. More navigation and structure editing commands are:

* <code>C-c C-f fountain-outline-forward</code>
* <code>C-c C-b fountain-outline-backward</code>
* <code>C-c C-n fountain-outline-next</code>
* <code>C-c C-p fountain-outline-previous</code>
* <code>C-c C-u fountain-outline-up</code>
* <code>C-c C-v fountain-outline-shift-down</code>
* <code>C-c C-^ fountain-outline-shift-up</code>
* <code>C-c C-SPC fountain-outline-mark</code>
