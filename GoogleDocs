You can use [http://code.google.com/p/googlecl/ this commandline program] to edit a Google Doc with your local EDITOR:

  google docs list
  google docs edit --title "title of Google Doc you wish to edit"

I put the following in my .bashrc:

    alias gdl='google docs list'
    gde() {
	google docs edit --title "$@"
    }

    export EDITOR=/home/bshanks/bin/myemacsclient

-- BayleShanks

Another option using gdrive (requires helm for completion)

    (defvar gdocs-folder-id "<gdrive folder for exported docs>"
     "location for storing org to gdocs exported files, use 'gdrive list  -t <foldername>' to find the id")

    (defun gdoc-export-buffer ()
      "Export current buffer as google doc to folder identified by gdocs-folder-id"
      (interactive)
      (shell-command
      (format "gdrive upload --convert --mimetype text/plain --parent %s --file %s"
          gdocs-folder-id buffer-file-name)))

    (defun gdoc-import-buffer (doc)
       "Import a file in gdocs-folder-id into current buffer"
       (interactive 
       (list
          (completing-read "Choose one: "
                     (split-string
                      (shell-command-to-string
                       (format "gdrive list -q \"'%s' in parents\"" gdocs-folder-id)) "\n"))))
      (insert (replace-regexp-in-string (string ?\C-m) (string ?\C-j) (shell-command-to-string
      (format "gdrive download -s --format txt --id %s" (car (split-string doc " ")))))))
