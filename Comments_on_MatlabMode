I cannot get matlab.el to color comments differently.  Yes, colors do appear:  keywords like "function" are in cyan.  But comments are not colored.  This is very frustrating, and I have wasted hours on it now.  Please help.

Works for me. I downloaded the tarball, loaded matlab.el, switched my buffer to matlab-mode, and copied some examples from an [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/MATLAB_Programming/Comments online book]. Take a look:

##M-x describe-text-properties## confirms that `font-lock-comment-face' is being used.

Thanks for your response.  I tried this.  

M-x describe-text-properties confirms for me that 'font-lock-comment-face' is being used ... 

but my comment color remains green (not red).  How can I set that color to red?

My color scheme is also very different than what you show.  I have cyan keywords, blue function names, and green text on a black background.  Comments are supposed to be red.

I say "supposed to be red" because I resolved this problem on a linux-based machine in my department, where I use red for comments.  I was able to fix it by removing the following line from my .emacs file
(set-background-color "black") 

I have no such line on my OSX emacs.el, and adding it has no effect.  I would greatly appreciate any help!

Hi Alex, 

I am wondering if you have any suggestion for the problem that is described above.  

Thanks,

I have no idea. You seem to be using a different color theme. Perhaps ##M-x customize-face RET font-lock-comment-face RET## will help? I'm using the standard colors. I'd suggest starting with running emacs -q and emacs -Q to and loading bits and pieces of your init file until you find the statements that make it work -- and the statements that break it.
