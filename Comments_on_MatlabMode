I cannot get matlab.el to color comments differently.  Yes, colors do appear:  keywords like "function" are in cyan.  But comments are not colored.  This is very frustrating, and I have wasted hours on it now.  Please help.

Works for me. I downloaded the tarball, loaded matlab.el, switched my buffer to matlab-mode, and copied some examples from an [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/MATLAB_Programming/Comments online book]. Take a look:
