I use Emacs. ... except for mailing with mutt. In that case (typically in a Putty terminal) I use vi.
Okay, sometimes I have emacs running in that putty session and read the mails with ansi-term mode and mutt.
In this case my editor is emacsclient. Though I am still curious what will happen if vi opens in an
ansi-term buffer.
