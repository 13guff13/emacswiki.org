= RFCs/Proposals =

* [[Flavors]] - formalizing large customizations of Emacs

= Notes =

* ElispStaticAnalysis
** http://people.cs.aau.dk/~normark/emacs-lisp/emacs-lisp-static-analysis/index.html
** "Down with Emacs Lisp: Dynamic Scope Analysis"
* Shims
** What are the ways to preserve backwards compatibility between versions of Emacs?

= Emacs Lisp Pages of Interest =

* [[rx]] - I appreciated Perl's ##/x## modifier, so this approach is appealing.
* StateMachine
