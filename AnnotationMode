Note: This doesn't exist (as far as I know.)

I really wish I had something that for lack of a better term, I'll call %%AnnotationMode%%.

The idea is that I want to be able to hang notes on to any file I'm visiting, without touching the file.

What I'm envisioning is a system that, when activated, will split the pane vertically and pull an annotation file from a repository someplace, if it exists, and create one if it doesn't.

Once up, it would allow the creation and maintenance of notes, which it would synchronize vertically, as best it could.

Thoughts? -- MichaelWilson

This idea was implemented several different times in the late 90s, culminating in a whole rebranding of Emacs that focused on making a hyperlinked "knowledge database" complete with shadowed annotations and everything (can't remember the name off-hand).  I tried them all, and they were all failures.  In fact, to this day I've never had a good annotation system on any platform. -- JohnWiegley

Emacs bookmarks and their annotations come very close to what you describe (though that might not correspond closely to what you really have in mind ;-)).

You can bookmark any file (not just text -- image, music, anything), without necessarily visiting it.  And a bookmark can include an annotation (free-form plain text).  A bookmark does not alter its target file.

So far, bookmark annotations are pretty rudimentary.  Editing an annotation uses `##Edit Bookmark Annotation##' mode, which is not very fancy.  That could be improved.  And you could of course change the mode to any you like (e.g. OrgMode).

In addition to annotations, you can tag bookmarks, in the sense of [[http://delicious.com|del.icio.us]] tags.  Tags give you a good way to organize bookmarks and hence their target files or annotations.

See Manual:Bookmarks.  See also [[Bookmark+]] and [[Dired+]] for info on bookmark tags and bookmarking files without visiting them. -- DrewAdams
