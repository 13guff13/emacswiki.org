Wanderlust is a mail/news reader for Emacs(en) apparently written from the ground up for IMAP. It seems to have very good support for Japanese, but it works quite-well for this English-speaker.

It is the only emacs mail reader that I have used that seems to handle IMAP properly (i.e., leaves messages on server, cacheing, etc.). Gnus (CategoryGnus) users may disagree. It integrates with BBDB (CategoryBbdb), supports MIME, can handle integrating with mailcrypt (cvs version) (WanderLustEncryption). MIME and PGP/MIME is handled via SEMI (SemiIsEmacsMimeInterface). Key-bindings are, at least to me, a little foreign at first. Documentation in English is sufficient though not overwhelming. 

== Requirements ==

Supported Emacsen:

* Mule-2.3@19.34
* Mule for Win32
* Meadow-1.01 or later
* NTEmacs 20.4 or later
* Emacs 20.3 or later
* XEmacs-20.4 or later

Other Requirements:

[[SEMI]] 1.14.3 or later (for SEMI you need [[APEL]] and [[FLIM]]).  Recommended combination of APEL, FLIM and SEMI are following.

* APEL 10.7, FLIM 1.14.5 and SEMI 1.14.5 

== Basic Usage ==
Wanderlust has four basic buffers: Folder buffer, summary buffer, message buffer/view, and draft buffer. 

Wanderlust starts in folder buffer, from which you can open a summary buffer (press "q" to close), which lists a summary of all messages in chosen folder. Navigate up/down with n/p, and N/P (only unread messages). Open a message for viewing with RET, and scroll up/down with SPC/BKSPC or RET/M-RET for line-scrolling. You can jump to the message with "j" for copying text, for instance, and press "q" to go back to summary buffer. Pressing "v" hides the message buffer, and "l" toggles the list of folders (folder buffer). 

Pressing a/A opens the draft buffer for answering the message at point with/without citing the message. To write a new message press "w". You can auto complete email addresses (form ~/.addresses), with TAB in the draft buffer. 

There's tons of more stuff you can do so reading the manual at the home page is a must. 


== Configuration (Quickstart) ==
To get started, add the following line to your InitFile:
<pre>
(autoload 'wl "wl" "Wanderlust" t)
</pre>

As well as your InitFile, wl reads its configuration from two places: ~/.wl and ~/.folders. Samples of each file which include a few tips: [[.wl]] and [[.folders]].

For the new user, the configuration can be quite troublesome. I had to look up most info myself in the wl mailing archives, which was a very tiresome process. I hope the following section helps you getting started with wanderlust.

(This section is only a stub and will be updated gradually.)

The first thing you will want to do is setup your folder. In folder view, go to the next line after Desktop, hit `m a' and add the folder information. You'll need to read the manual (accessible via info or on the website) about the format and options. If a connection has been established, you can enter the password. `M-x elmo-passwd-alist-save' lets you save your passwords to ~/.elmo/passwd, so that you don't have to enter them every time. `m p' on a folder gives the folder a nice pet name (which you can choose, of course). `s' on a folder syncs it (checks for updates on the server). `q' exits the current view and asks if changes should be performed.

Wanderlust doesn't automatically display all your IMAP folders. Add:

    %/

to your .folders to get all your folders. This doesn't obey your
subscribed list, but at least it shows your folders. Annoyingly it all
sorts them in reverse order.

(It is not difficult to sort them in alphabetical order: simply type
"m s" on the parent folder.)

You can use the same notation to browse any of wanderlust's folder types. For instance, the following in your .folders file:  

    @/

will produce a hierarchical tree of all shimbun feeds, which you can then browse.

Similarly,

    -/

will show you the complete hierarchy of newsgroups available on your default nntp server. 

If your messages contain attachments, you can type `v' to launch an external program with it. You will be asked which method to use. Hit the tab key to see the available methods. To configure your own programs, you'll have to add/edit the mime types in the ~/.mailcap file. Here is an example (you might have to use "%s" instead of %s if you get into trouble with spaces in filenames):

~/.mailcap:
{{{
application/excel;		/usr/bin/oocalc2 %s
application/x-excel;		/usr/bin/oocalc2 %s
application/x-msexcel;		/usr/bin/oocalc2 %s
application/vnd.ms-excel;	/usr/bin/oocalc2 %s
application/ms-word;		/usr/bin/oowriter2 %s
application/powerpoint;		/usr/bin/ooimpress2 %s
application/mspowerpoint;	/usr/bin/ooimpress2 %s
application/vnd.ms-powerpoint;	/usr/bin/ooimpress2 %s
application/pdf;		/usr/bin/xpdf %s
application/x-bz; 		/usr/bin/xarchiver %s
application/x-bzip2;		/usr/bin/xarchiver %s
application/x-compress;		/usr/bin/xarchiver %s
application/x-compressed;	/usr/bin/xarchiver %s
application/x-gtar;		/usr/bin/xarchiver %s
application/x-gzip;		/usr/bin/xarchiver %s
application/x-zip-compressed;	/usr/bin/xarchiver %s
application/x-tar; 		/usr/bin/xarchiver %s
application/zip; 		/usr/bin/xarchiver %s
multipart/x-zip; 		/usr/bin/xarchiver %s
audio/*;			/usr/bin/play %s
image/*;			/usr/bin/gimp %s
image/*;			/usr/bin/gqview %s
multipart/x-gzip;		/usr/bin/xarchiver %s
text/html;		 	/usr/bin/firefox %s
text/plain;			/usr/bin/emacs %s
video/*;			/usr/bin/gmplayer %s
}}}

You might also add the following to your ~/.wl file to allow you starting your browser when hitting the specified key (in this case, `f') while `point' is at url:

~/.wl:
{{{
;; browse url key
(add-hook 'mime-view-mode-hook
	  (lambda ()
	    (local-set-key "f" 'browse-url)))
}}}

The file will be read when you start wl. 

=== Setting up with Gmail ==
Put the following in your .wl:
{{{
;; IMAP, gmail:
(setq elmo-imap4-default-server "imap.gmail.com"
      elmo-imap4-default-user "myname@gmail.com"
      elmo-imap4-default-authenticate-type 'clear
      elmo-imap4-default-port '993
      elmo-imap4-default-stream-type 'ssl

      ;;for non ascii-characters in folder-names
      elmo-imap4-use-modified-utf7 t)

;; SMTP
(setq wl-smtp-connection-type 'starttls
      wl-smtp-posting-port 587
      wl-smtp-authenticate-type "plain"
      wl-smtp-posting-user "myname"
      wl-smtp-posting-server "smtp.gmail.com"
      wl-local-domain "gmail.com"
      wl-message-id-domain "smtp.gmail.com")

(setq wl-from "My Name <myname@gmail.com>"

      ;;all system folders (draft, trash, spam, etc) are placed in the
      ;;[Gmail]-folder, except inbox. "%" means it's an IMAP-folder
      wl-default-folder "%inbox"
      wl-draft-folder   "%[Gmail]/Drafts"
      wl-trash-folder   "%[Gmail]/Trash"
      wl-fcc            "%[Gmail]/Sent"

      ;; mark sent messages as read (sent messages get sent back to you and
      ;; placed in the folder specified by wl-fcc)
      wl-fcc-force-as-read    t

      ;;for when auto-compleating foldernames
      wl-default-spec "%")
}}}
Then you also need to set up your .folder-file. See [[WlMultipleAccounts]] for an example.
