It is sometimes annoying to use multiple shells from within emacs. One must create a shell, rename it, create another, etc.

== Shell-switcher ==

[https://github.com/DamienCassou/shell-switcher shell-switcher] is an emacs minor mode to easily switch between shell buffers (like with alt+tab). It works with eshell and any other shell.

Check the [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNSrrQwcCr4 screencast]!


== Multi-eshell ==

[http://cims.nyu.edu/~stucchio/software/elisp/multi-eshell.el.html multi-eshell.el] exists. It maintains a ring of shell buffers, and has 3 useful functions:

multi-eshell -- Creates a NEW shell and switches to it, even if one already exists.

multi-eshell-switch -- If not in a shell buffer, return to the last EXISTING
                       shell buffer. Otherwise, switch to the next buffer in
                       the shell ring.

multi-eshell-go-back -- Switch to the previous buffer in the shell ring.

Q: What advantages does this provide over using M-x eshell-new along with various buffer switching techniques?

A: Convenience, nothing more. One-button cycling through eshell buffers can be faster than C-x b *eshell*<2> (especially if you don't remember which *eshell*<?> you want to switch to). Also, is eshell-new part of emacs? It doesn't appear to be in 22.1.50 (of Carbon emacs).

multi-eshell-function calls multi-eshell-shell-function that may change default-directory (the shell command does that). Thus, when wanting to start a new shell with multi-eshell-shell-function=shell, the new shell will be started in the same directory than the previous shell while it would make more sense to launch it in the default-directory where the multi-eshell was launched. This should fix this issues :
