I use emacs(meadow).

* Lisp:highlight-cl.el

:: Highlighting `cl' functions.

* Lisp:anything-yaetags.el

:: Yet another etags interface with anything.

* Lisp:descbinds-anything.el

:: replacement of `describe-bindings' with anything.

* Lisp:paint.el

:: Make a emacs to the paint tool.

* VlineMode

:: Very nice! Please consider adding a face variable (`defvar') for face `vline', and use that in your code. That way, other code can make the `vline' code use a particular face in some context, without affecting the user's choice for face `vline'. For example, other code could then do this:

             (let ((vline-style 'face)
                   (vline-face 'hl-line-face))
              ...)

Minor bug, I think: if `vline-show' gets called twice in a row for some reason, the highlighting is a bit messed up (space chars, in particular, seem shifted). A third call fixes it (workaround).

Question: Is it intentional that the highlighting doesn't appear if there is an active region (TransientMarkMode)?

:: Fixed.

:: Not intentional.  Priority of region highlighting seems be higher than [[text property]] and [[overlay]]. I have no idea for this problem. You have it?
