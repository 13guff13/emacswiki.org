Install [https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html PuTTY] and make sure ##plink.exe## is on your PATH.

Now you can use something like the following: ##/plink:alex@example.org##.

If you always use the ##plink## method, you can make it the default:

{{{
(setq tramp-default-method "plink")
}}}

Or you can put it all together like this such that your init file will work for both Windows and other operating systems:

{{{
(when (eq window-system 'w32)
  (setq tramp-default-method "plink")
  (when (and (not (string-match putty-directory (getenv "PATH")))
	     (file-directory-p putty-directory))
    (setenv "PATH" (concat putty-directory ";" (getenv "PATH")))))
}}}
