*Delight* enables you to easily customise how major and minor modes appear in the ModeLine.

It is similar in purpose to DiminishedModes but it accounts for major modes as well as minor modes, and also incorporates the necessary `eval-after-load' call.

Lisp:delight.el

==Example usage==

 (require 'delight)
 
 (delight 'abbrev-mode " Abv" "abbrev")
 
 (delight '((abbrev-mode " Abv" abbrev)
            (smart-tab-mode " \\t" smart-tab)
            (eldoc-mode nil "eldoc")
            (rainbow-mode)
            (emacs-lisp-mode "Elisp" "lisp-mode")))

The first argument is the mode symbol.

The second argument is the replacement name to use in the mode line (or nil to hide it).

The third argument is passed to `eval-after-load' and should be either the name (as a string) of the library file which defines the mode, or the feature (symbol) provided by that library. If this argument is nil, the mode symbol will be passed as the feature. In the above example, ##rainbow-mode## is the symbol for both the minor mode and the feature which provides it, and its lighter text will be hidden from the mode line.

==Important notes==

Although strings are common, any mode-line construct is permitted as the value (for both minor and major modes); so before you override a value you should check the existing one, as you may want to replicate any structural elements in your replacement if it turns out not to be a simple string.

* For major modes, ##M-: mode-name##
* For minor modes, ##M-: (cadr (assq 'MODE minor-mode-alist))## for the minor MODE in question.

Conversely, you may incorporate additional mode-line constructs in your replacement values, if you so wish. e.g.:

 (delight 'emacs-lisp-mode
          '("Elisp" (lexical-binding ":Lex" ":Dyn"))
          'lisp-mode)

See `mode-line-format' for information about mode-line constructs, and ##M-: (info "(elisp) Mode Line Format")## for further details.

Settings for minor modes are held in a global variable and tend to take immediate effect upon calling `delight'. Major mode names are held in buffer-local variables, however, so changes to these will not take effect in a given buffer unless the major mode is called again, or the buffer is reverted. Calling ##M-x normal-mode## is sufficient in most cases.

Also bear in mind that some modes may dynamically update these values themselves (for instance dired-mode updates mode-name if you change the sorting criteria) in which cases this library may prove inadequate.
