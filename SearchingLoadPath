Here scour-load-path-for will search for a file in the load-path returning its path, or nil if the file cannot be found.

<pre>
(defmacro filter (var condition list)
  `(loop for ,var in ,list when ,condition collect ,var))

(defun scour-load-path-for (filename)
  "Search for a file throughout the load-path"
  (let ((files (project-filter dir (file-exists-p (directory-file-name dir))
				   load-path)))
    (loop for dir in files
	  when (member filename (directory-files dir))
	  return (format "%s/%s" (directory-file-name dir)
			 filename))))
</pre>
