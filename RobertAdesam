I have been using Emacs since 1994 and use it on Mac OS X, Linux,
Solaris, and sometimes on Windows. It has not been the smoothest ride,
I have tried to exchange Emacs for other tools like Eclipse,
!NetBeans, Thunderbird, Mail.app etc, but I have given up. Emacs is
for me.

== Emacs Daily Usage ==

I use Emacs daily for
* [CategoryViewMail reading/writing my Email],
* [OrgMode organising] my life,
* [AUCTeX writing papers], and of course for
* programming.

== Init Files ==

* RobertAdesamConfig -- the Mac Mini @work running Mac OS 10.5; the
!ThinkPad @work running Mandriva 2010 and Windows 7 Enterprise; and my Samsung netbook @home running Windows 7 Starter.
* RobertAdesamEmacsClientBat -- bat file for starting emacsclientw.exe on my netbook @home running Windows 7 Starter.

== Contact ==

You can reach me via
* email [mailto:robert@adesam.se robert@adesam.se], and my web site at
* URL http://www.adesam.se/robert/
