I use emacs, although I have used XEmacs in the past.  I've been using emacs for about 13 years now, have read the source code a couple of times and have finally started to get into learning to write elisp.  I change from using emacs for everything, to using emacs as just a code editor every once and a while, if only because I can never make up my mind about which configuration I prefer.  I find the philosophy and design of the emacs program to be very important, and it should be used as a learning tool for all future software hackers and developers.  Thank you RMS for sharing this work with us for us all to learn from and grow with.
