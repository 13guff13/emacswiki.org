Thank you, Alex :)  I've unobfuscated the email addresses, since all my email is already filtered by spamassassin.

[:InitFiles]
= Init Files =

I have been using a ''split file'' setup for my laptop's Emacs installation for a few months now.  This seemed a bit confusing at first, and it took me a while to learn enough about EmacsLisp to make the startup of my Emacs sessions more effective.  Now that things look a bit more ''stable'', here is a list of the various init files I use.  Follow the link of each init file section, to see what my current setup looks like.

* GiorgosKeramidasConfigOrganization -- how I have split my ##.emacs## startup file in smaller chunks, to make things easier to find
* GiorgosKeramidasConfigAutoload -- automatically loading Emacs modules when necessary
* GiorgosKeramidasConfigBbdb -- defaults and options for the [[CategoryBbdb|bbdb]] contact database
* GiorgosKeramidasConfigCcMode -- defaults for editing C program sources
* GiorgosKeramidasConfigDefaults -- various, uncategorized default settings
* GiorgosKeramidasConfigErc -- setup of the [[ERC]] client for IRC chat networks
* GiorgosKeramidasConfigGnus -- my current [[CategoryGnus|Gnus]] email- and news-reading setup
* GiorgosKeramidasConfigHooks -- miscellaneous hook functions for Emacs modes
* GiorgosKeramidasConfigKeys -- global keyboard bindings
* GiorgosKeramidasConfigLang -- language environment options (mostly ''UTF-8'' and ''ISO 8859-7'' related)
* GiorgosKeramidasConfigUserInterface -- user interface options (menus, scroll-bars, tool-bars, etc)
