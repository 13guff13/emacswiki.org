This is a simple emacs mode for [http://ximbiot.com/cvs/manual/cvs-1.12.13/cvs_18.html editing cvs configuration files in CVSROOT].

It has font-lock support for all of the files, and indentation support for CVSROOT/modules

Current cvs-admin-mode.el uses define-derived-mode which is a standard library of Emacs22, but I think is absent from Emacs21

* [http://gropeep.org/emacs/cvs-admin-mode.el Lisp:cvs-admin-mode.el]

== Install ==

Add the file to your LoadPath, and add the following to your InitFile:

{{{
(require 'cvs-admin-mode)
}}}

== Usage ==

Open a file stored in a directory called CVSROOT, and cvs-admin-mode should come up automatically.
