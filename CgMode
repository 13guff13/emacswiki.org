A major mode for editing [http://developer.nvidia.com/object/cg_toolkit.html
Cg], 
This is a basic version of the mode, but should be useable.  I encourage people to work on it!

Available at:
Lisp:cg-mode.el


One way to load this, add to ~/.emacs (or see LoadPath):

    (setq load-path (cons "/home/user/directory-with-cg-mode" load-path))
    (require 'cg-mode)

By default it is used for files with the .cg extension.
