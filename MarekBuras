Hi ! My name is Marek Buras. My friends call me Cyfron. I live in Poland. Currently studying physics at University of Silesia.

I'm Emacs user. I use GNU Emacs as my every day work environment.  I read mail with GNUs, surf web pages with w3m (sometimes with Mozilla) and chatting with erc (mzkb on #emacs@irc.freenode.net)

I like listening music. Of course GNU Emacs is my favourite media player :) I wrote some functions to control alsaplayer from GNU Emacs. This is what I put to my .emacs:

<pre>
(defun alsaplayer-enqeue (file)
  "Enqueue file to alsaplayer playlist."
  (interactive "FAlsaplayer add file: ")
  (call-process "alsaplayer" nil nil nil "-e" (expand-file-name file)))

(defun alsaplayer-enqeue-dired ()
  "Enqueue file to alsaplayer playlist."
  (interactive)
  (call-process "alsaplayer" nil nil nil "-e" (dired-get-filename)))

(defun alsaplayer-add-dired-marked-files ()
  "Add the files marked in a dired buffer"
  (interactive)
  (dolist (item (dired-get-marked-files))
  (call-process "alsaplayer" nil nil nil "-e" item)))

(defun alsaplayer-go ()
  "Start alsaplayer process with quiet option."
  (interactive)
  (start-process "alsaplayer" nil "alsaplayer" "-i" "daemon" "-q" "-x"))

(defun alsaplayer-quit ()
  "Quit alsaplayer process"
  (interactive)
  (start-process "alsaplayer" nil "alsaplayer" "--quit"))

(defun alsaplayer-next ()
  "Play next track."
  (interactive)
  (start-process "alsaplayer" nil "alsaplayer" "--next"))

(defun alsaplayer-prev ()
  "Play previous track."
  (interactive)
  (start-process "alsaplayer" nil "alsaplayer" "--prev"))

(defun alsaplayer-stop ()
  "Stop playing."
  (interactive)
  (start-process "alsaplayer" nil "alsaplayer" "--stop"))

(defun alsaplayer-start ()
  "Start playing."
  (interactive)
  (start-process "alsaplayer" nil "alsaplayer" "--start"))

(defun alsaplayer-pause ()
  "Alsaplayer play/pause command."
  (interactive)
  (start-process "alsaplayer" nil "alsaplayer" "--pause"))

(defun alsaplayer-status ()
  "Print status of alsaplayer in other window."
  (interactive)
  (call-process "alsaplayer" nil "*alsaplayer-status*" nil "--status")
  (switch-to-buffer "*alsaplayer-status*"))
</pre>

Welcome to the wiki!  -- DeepakGoel

I am confused.  The hostname seems to indicate that this page was indeed deleted by Marek Buras, but the username seems to contradict this.  Do
you have an evil little brother using your computer?  :) -- AlexSchroeder

Thanks for turning this page back. Don't know what was happen. Moreover somebody has changed my homepage at republika pl and probably read my mail... I deleted all shell acounts on my box and blocked sshd. The big investigation has been begun :) -- MarekBuras

Ouch.  :( -- AlexSchroeder
