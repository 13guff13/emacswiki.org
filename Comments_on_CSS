Is there any reason why HTTPS urls for CSS files wouldn't work?

This:

https://raw.github.com/nicferrier/nics-emacswiki-css/master/nicferrier.css

does not work when used in a CSS enabler:

http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki?action=browse;id=CSS;css=https://raw.github.com/nicferrier/nics-emacswiki-css/master/nicferrier.css

Are you sure that is the problem? I can't check the MIME type on my phone but that has been a problem for me in the past, for example.
