winring.el by BarryWarsaw allows you to switch between named window configurations ("mail", "irc", "gnus" etc.) with the C-x 7 prefix command.
There is a ring of window configurations for every frame.

To use, make sure this file is on your `load-path' and put the
following in your ~/.emacs file:

    (require 'winring)
    (winring-initialize)

You can get it from here:

Barry comments upon other existing similar packages in the commentary of the file:

* `escreen' by Noah Friedman (EmacsScreen).  A much more ambitious package
  that does Emacs window session management.  Very cool, but I
  wanted something more lightweight.
* `wconfig' by Bob Weiner as part of Hyperbole.  I think wconfig
  is similar in spirit to winring; it seems to have also have
  named window configurations, but not frame-specific window
  rings.
* `winner' by Ivar Rummelhoff (WinnerMode).  This package comes with Emacs
  20, and appears to differ from winring by providing undo/redo
  semantics to window configuration changes.  winner is a minor
  mode and does seem to support frame-specific window rings.
* `window-xemacs' by the XEmacs Development Team.  It appears
  that this package, which is specific to XEmacs (and perhaps
  just XEmacs 20) implements stacks of window configurations
  which are frame independent.
