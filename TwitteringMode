== Description ==

twittering-mode.el is a Twitter client

[[image:TwitteringModeScreenshot]]

Home page: http://twmode.sourceforge.net/

Github page: http://github.com/hayamiz/twittering-mode/tree/master

##git clone git://github.com/hayamiz/twittering-mode.git##

== Basic configuration ==

Do the following in your .emacs file for a quick start.

 (load "~/.emacs.d/twittering-mode.el")
 (require 'twittering-mode)
 (setq twittering-username "twitter user name here")
 (setq twittering-password "twitter password here") ; This is optional

If you don't set your password it will be asked to you when you run twittering-mode

== Basic key bindings ==

* `C-c C-s' to write a tweet (`twittering-update-status-interactive')
* `j' to go to the next tweet (`twittering-goto-next-status')
* `k' to go to the previous tweet (`twittering-goto-previous-status')
* `C-m' (Enter key) to reply to the current tweet or to open the URL under the cursor (`twittering-enter')
* `C-c C-m' (C-c Enter) to retweet the current tweet (`twittering-retweet')
* `C-c C-f' to read your friends' timeline (`twittering-friends-timeline')
* `C-c C-r' to read your replies (`twittering-replies-timeline')
* `C-c C-u' to read your own timeline (`twittering-user-timeline')
* `g' to refresh the current timeline (`twittering-current-timeline')
* `v' to view the timeline of the user under the cursor (`twittering-other-user-timeline')
* `V' to view the timeline of any user (`twittering-other-user-timeline-interactive')

== Customizing your key bindings ==

You can use `twittering-mode-hook' to customize your configuration. This example shows how to define a few key bindings:

 (add-hook 'twittering-mode-hook
           (lambda ()
             (local-set-key "f" 'twittering-friends-timeline)
             (local-set-key "r" 'twittering-replies-timeline)
             (local-set-key "u" 'twittering-user-timeline)
             (local-set-key "w" 'twittering-update-status-interactive)))

== Other useful options ==

 (twittering-icon-mode)                       ; Show icons (requires wget)
 (setq twittering-timer-interval 300)         ; Update your timeline each 300 seconds (5 minutes)
 (setq twittering-tmp-dir "/path/to/tmp/dir") ; Directory to store buddy icons

twittering-mode also provides hooks that are run when new tweets arrive. This example calls notify-send (included in the libnotify package) to display a message when new tweets arrive:

 (add-hook 'twittering-new-tweets-hook (lambda ()
   (let ((n twittering-new-tweets-count))
     (start-process "twittering-notify" nil "notify-send"
                    "-i" "/usr/share/pixmaps/gnome-emacs.png"
                    "New tweets"
                    (format "You have %d new tweet%s"
                            n (if (> n 1) "s" ""))))))

[[halloleo]]: i'm trying this mode and it works pretty good, but i'm not sure how to completely /finish/ using twitter. does 'q' (`twittering-suspend') do this? i don't think so: it only switches to another buffer, therefore the twitter timer still retrieves tweets...

RichardRiley : What packages are needed for icon support? Also, wouldnt


      (define-key km "q" 'delete-window)


be a good addition?

[new]
For icon support, try adding ##(twittering-icon-mode)## to your ##.emacs## -- AlbertoGarcia

[new]
You need wget for icon support on Linux. it can take a while to download icons so be patient - RichardRiley.

[new]
That's a bug IMHO. The problem is that icons are downloaded while the timeline is being displayed on screen, so the first time a new user appears in your timeline, you won't see their icon because it's still being downloaded. You have to wait till the next refresh (or press "g" to force it) -- AlbertoGarcia.

[new]
I'm just wondering if I have missed something obvious. The default is to see your friends tweets. But how do I tweet to my tweet account from there? Currently I have to  go to my timeline (C-c C-u)) and then hitting return : is there a quicker way? -- RichardRiley.

[new]
You can use the somewhat non-obvious keybinding of C-c C-s (twittering-update-status-interactive).

Icon support does not work in windows.  I have gnu wget installed and in path, and the icons are downloading to twittering-tmp-dir.  However, they do not display in icon mode. --Tim Hoolihan

[new]
Icon Works on Windows needs GNU Win32 image packages (http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages.html) installed, which includes jpeg, libungif, libpng,  xpm, and zlib, etc. And the packages dir must be set into the %PATH% environment various. 

BTW: I wish this code would support HTTPS and third-party API in the future. It would be very useful. --Moses

[new]
I wish twittering-mode would support socket proxy. I only use tor to connect twitter. --rix

[new]
I wrote some patches so that icon-mode works well without external programs, wget and convert.
You can get it from my repository on github http://github.com/cvmat/twittering-mode/tree/without-external-program . I confirmed it with NTEmacs on Windows XP and Emacs on Debian. -- Tadashi MATSUO

[new]
Sorry for my rudeness. At last, I found tor+privoxy can make a http proxy. privoxy's default proxy port is 8118. --rix

[new]
hayamiz has merged my patches into the main repository. The main repository http://github.com/hayamiz/twittering-mode/tree/master now supports icon-mode without external programs. --Tadashi MATSUO

[new]
Any chance we can have a count of characters while tweeting in the minibuffer? (twit.el has this, I should look at how it's done) 

[new]
I can't see my followee's retweets. I'm following @ebertchicago(Roger Ebert, a film critik), but can't see his massive retweets. Can anybody tell me how can I fix it? -Jeongtae Roh
