For a discussion, see DynamicBindingVsLexicalBinding.

Emacs 24 has lexical binding, if you want it. To use it, set `lexical-binding' and evaluate code in the same buffer.

You can have closures in Emacs -- no need for FakeClosures!

{{{
(setq lexical-binding t)
(setq test (let ((foo "bar"))
	     (lambda () 
	       (message foo))))
=> (closure ((foo . "bar") t) nil (message foo))
(funcall test)
=> "bar"
}}}
