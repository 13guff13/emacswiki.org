Click on the heading to find all pages related to window management in Emacs.

== Introduction to Windows ==

* [[Window]] -- what a window is
* WindowConfiguration -- what a window configuration is
* ModeLine, ModeLinePosition -- the mode-line of a window

== Windows Navigation (Selection) ==

Move among windows -- alternatives to `C-x o' (`other-window') and `next-window'.

* Use arrow keys
** WindMove
** WindowNavigation
* Use a window name or number
** NumberedWindows
** WindowNumberingMode
** `C-u C-x o' in [[Icicles]] -- Cycle/filter/complete window names
** Lisp:switch-window.el shows big numbers in each window, you input the number to get where you want to.

== Complex Window Configurations ==

* TransposeWindows -- rearranging windows within a [[Frame]]
* ToggleWindowSplit -- toggle between vertical and horizontal split
* WindowResize -- resizing windows using simple keybindings
** DoReMi -- resize windows incrementally, using arrow keys or mouse wheel. Hold Meta key to boost resizing increment.

* OneWindow -- adapting Emacs to always use only one window for whatever it does
* HorizontalSplitting -- force Emacs to always use split-window-horizontally instead of split-window for temporary buffers, like C-x C-b and describe-function.
* WidenWindow -- widening the active window

== Switching Window Configurations ==

* WinnerMode -- undoing and redoing changes to the window configuration
* WindowsAndRegisters -- storing window configurations in registers
* EmacsLispScreen (elscreen.el) -- switch between numbered screens with the C-\ prefix command
* EmacsScreen (escreen.el) -- same thing
* PolicySwitch -- Manages lists of window configurations as policies.  Offers persistence across sessions.
* WinRing -- switch between named window configurations ("mail", "irc", "gnus" etc.) with the C-x 7 prefix command.
* WindowsMode -- open new configurations, keep track of them, and store them to disk (SessionManagement)
* TaskMode -- switch between tasks just by switching between buffers
* LayoutRestore -- save multi-window layout and restore it simply
* CategorizingInformationManager -- provides ee-windows for switching between window configurations
* RecursiveEditPreservingWindowConfig -- temporarily changing the window configuration using RecursiveEdit
* BFocus ([[bfocus.el]]) -- Simple script to temporarly fill a frame with a window and then change back to previous configuration.

* CategoryBufferSwitching -- Rather than switching window configurations, maybe you just want a more advanced buffer switching algorithm.

== Frame Configurations ==

To save the current configuration of ''frames'' and later restore it, use `C-x r f' (<code>frame-configuration-to-register</code>) and `C-x r j' (<code>jump-to-register</code>), respectively. See FramesAndRegisters.

'''See also:'''

* [[Shrink-Wrapping Frames]] for commands to resize frames.
* [[FrameModes#FrameCommands]] for commands to:
** Resize and move frames incrementally, using the arrow keys.
** Iconify/hide all frames and restore them using `C-M-z'.
** Tile all visible frames horizontally or vertically. Particularly useful before comparing buffers with Ediff.

* DoReMi for commands to resize and move frames incrementally, using the arrow keys or mouse wheel.
