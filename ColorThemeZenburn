The zenburn color theme is a low-contrast color theme. The color scheme was originally designed for 'vim` and since then ported to various other programs.

The official version of zenburn-for-emacs is maintained by DanielBrockman; the version is a slightly updated version. An updated fork of the original project featuring all of EmacsWiki's contributions and more is maintained by BozhidarBatsov [http://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs here].

In an effort to have a unified and most complete version of the zenburn theme for Emacs I've started a GitHub project based initially on the version of zenburn.el from EmacsWiki. I'd be great
if you fork my repo or send me patches so that we can maintain an updated version of the theme there. The repo is located [http://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs here].

I made some additions to the theme and noticed something odd that I didn't want to "fix" in case there was something I was missing. The face zenburn-foreground is referenced a few times but isn't defined anywhere, I think these instances should be referencing zenburn-fg. Is this correct? - KGB.
