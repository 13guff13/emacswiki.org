Hi, I have been using XEmacs ever since -- for about 15 years -- to do everything (fist under unix now ubuntu). Since March 2011 I use emacs
23. The move to emacs imposed a significant psychological burden, and I was
most afraid of the following:

     + Q1.7 How do I run Gnus on both Emacs and XEmacs?

     A: You don't.

But this turned out to be no problem at all. 

==Has XEmacs-Emacs feature translation==

As expected, moving from a fully customized system to a slightly
different system, requires adjustments, here are some:

* the last line of my xemacs init.el file says: (plan) but emacs would not show planner-default-page at startup. Here is the fix:

 (setq inhibit-startup-screen 'yes-please)
 (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'plan)
 
* Starting with Emacs 22.1, `SPC' no longer completes file names in
the minibuffer. Obviously, a person from my generation spaces never creates
filenames with spaces (if you want to smooth and quickly get rid of the spaces in
all your filenames, try this: [[file-list.el]]). Whatsoever, here is how to
get the good old behaviour back:

 (define-key minibuffer-local-filename-completion-map (kbd "SPC")
  'minibuffer-complete-word)

 (define-key minibuffer-local-must-match-filename-map (kbd "SPC")
  'minibuffer-complete-word)
     
* XEmacs uses extents and Emacs uses text properties. I dont really
understand the differences or advantages, but to get my XEmacs lisp
code to work under emacs I changed 'buffer-substring' to
'buffer-substring-no-properties'.

==Needs XEmacs-Emacs feature translation ==

* What is the emacs equivalent of 'pop-window-configuration'?
