In GnuEmacs, you cannot open frames on other ttys.  You can, however, use the
same Emacs from different Linux consoles: Use screen(1) to do this.
This doesn't involve EmacsClient.

* Login, start screen, and within screen, start Emacs.
* Login on another tty again, start screen -x.  This will show you the
same Emacs.

Note that "another tty" may also be remote. Just ssh to the account
where you have your screen session running and start screen -x.

What you cannot do with Emacs is run Emacs in X and on the tty at the
same time.  This is possible with [[XEmacs]], as are all the features to be added to GnuEmacs as part of the MultiTTYSupport being integrated. 

Note that both of these issues are expected to be solved in a future
Emacs version. See MultiTTYSupport.
