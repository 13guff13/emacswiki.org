New to emacs and i l ove it  i have debian linux as my OS . 
My question is trying to understand downloading , pasting lisp code in the appropriate way. 
Am i suppose to paste any package i install into one file ?
Am i suppose to paste lisp in scratch?
I see all these neat packages and want to install them correctly
