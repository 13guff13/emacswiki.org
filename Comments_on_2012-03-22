Alex, I think they are right, exept about the content (What, no extensions ? Sheesh). All content must stay, only it has to be collectively validated. At the very least there should be a way to tell the questions from the answers! I say put *everything* on a robust (I did not say perfect) wiki system, and keep oddmuse as a baseless blogging SW.

I too have hard feelings about emacswiki, but then again, I cannot count the times I found useful bits of info on it.

For emacs, there is the (great) GNU emacs manual
For emacs extensions, there's emacs-wiki. Kill emacs-wiki, and stare at the gaping void it leaves.

I agree with the first part: the content has to be collectively validated and questions and answers should be clearly marked as such using subheadings, the [new] tag to change the background or bold keywords.

In order to get this project started, I charge *you* with building the necessary community and to get started. Thank you very much for organizing this major effort.

As for using a /robust/ wiki system, please check out http://wikemacs.org/ where Mediawiki is being used. I'm sure you'll find it more robust.

I cannot imagine myself simply killing Emacs Wiki – if it ends up being overtaken by other platforms, there's still the option of switching it to read-only mode… I'm afraid those who would prefer the gaping void will have to destroy their monitors instead.

By checking the recent changes it seems the development of WikEmacs slowed down considerably, [http://wikemacs.org/wiki/Special:RecentChanges there were only two edits in the last 7 days], so it doesn't look like it's killing EmacsWiki anytime soon. EmacsWiki is more alive.
