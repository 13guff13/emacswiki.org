Alex, I think they are right, exept about the content (What, no extensions ? Sheesh). All content must stay, only it has to be collectively validated. At the very least there should be a way to tell the questions from the answers! I say put *everything* on a robust (I did not say perfect) wiki system, and keep oddmuse as a baseless blogging SW.

I too have hard feelings about emacswiki, but then again, I cannot count the times I found useful bits of info on it.

For emacs, there is the (great) GNU emacs manual
For emacs extensions, there's emacs-wiki. Kill emacs-wiki, and stare at the gaping void it leaves.

I agree with the first part: the content has to be collectively validated and questions and answers should be clearly marked as such using subheadings, the [new] tag to change the background or bold keywords.

In order to get this project started, I charge *you* with building the necessary community and to get started. Thank you very much for organizing this major effort.

As for using a /robust/ wiki system, please check out http://wikemacs.org/ where Mediawiki is being used. I'm sure you'll find it more robust.

I cannot imagine myself simply killing Emacs Wiki – if it ends up being overtaken by other platforms, there's still the option of switching it to read-only mode… I'm afraid those who would prefer the gaping void will have to destroy their monitors instead.

By checking the recent changes it seems the development of WikEmacs slowed down considerably, [http://wikemacs.org/wiki/Special:RecentChanges there were only two edits in the last 7 days], so it doesn't look like it's killing EmacsWiki anytime soon. EmacsWiki is more alive.

Well, who knows. There was also a time when XEmacs was more popular than Emacs. That doesn't mean that the two teams had to merge. People just join the team they feel more comfortable with.

I guess I'm just tired of people telling me the things I already know (it would be nice to have professional editing) without volunteering the means to do it (massive amounts of cash to the tune of at least $100/h in my case or investing hours of their own time). That's just useless complaining. If, in addition to that, people tell me that I should switch the software from something I know and like to something I don't know and they like, or worse, to discontinue the project that works (albeit poorly) and invest /my/ time into /their/ ideas, then I feel just a little bit tired and I'm more than happy to point them to the alternative that purports to solve all the perceived problems.

I've written a [http://www.emacswiki.org/alex/2012-03-24_How_Emacs_Wiki_Works longer blog post on the topic].
