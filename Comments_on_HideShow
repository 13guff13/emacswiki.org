found some bug in python-mode
the code folding is activated for any text with pattern
"*def*" followed by any non alphabetic character followed with anything

'''"def[^a-zA-Z].*"'''

*examples*:
def_, def_abc, def|, def! etc....

Submit a regular bug report using Emacs? The wiki is poorly suited for that.

I'd like to know if there's any way to save the 'folded state' of the file between emacs sessions?
