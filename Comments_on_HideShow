found some bug in python-mode
the code folding is activated for any text with pattern
"*def*" followed by any non alphabetic character followed with anything

'''"def[^a-zA-Z].*"'''

*examples*:
def_, def_abc, def|, def! etc....

Submit a regular bug report using Emacs? The wiki is poorly suited for that.
