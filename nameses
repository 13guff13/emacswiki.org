Nameses enables named desktop sessions for emacs, and is based on [http://scottfrazersblog.blogspot.com/2009/12/emacs-named-desktop-sessions.html my-desktop].
The idea is that your desktop sessions are not associated with directories, but that you can simply switch between sessions such as "latex", "letters", "my-secret-project" etcetera.

== Why nameses? ==
Since I started using emacs as a daemon (LINK), it became more important for me to be able to switch between desktop sessions, because you typically have only one instance of emacs running. The package [http://scottfrazersblog.blogspot.com/2009/12/emacs-named-desktop-sessions.html my-desktop] proved useful for that, but did not completely fit my needs. Therefore I started this attempt at my first elisp package. These are some of the changes with regards to my-desktop:
* Once your session has a name, it is automatically saved when you exit emacs or switch to a different session.
* Added ido support for choosing sessions
* Desktop sessions are locked when in use
* You can remove sessions, with some checking to prevent removing other files
* You can easily switch to the previous session
* Nameses is compatible with lazy loading of the desktop
