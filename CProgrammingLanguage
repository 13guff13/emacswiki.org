Emacs supports C programming well by default since Emacs and many parts of the GNU system are written in C.  "GNU's not Unix", after all.  See TheGnuProject.

For programming in C with Emacs use CcMode.

For an integrated environment with advanced features use [[CEDET]].

For building indexes and running searches on definitions of C source code use EmacsTags.  The GnuGlobal is also popular.

For DebuggingWithEmacs use the GrandUnifiedDebugger.
