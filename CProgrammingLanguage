Emacs supports C programming well by default since Emacs and many parts of the GNU system are written in C.  "GNU's not Unix", after all.  See TheGnuProject.

For programming in C with Emacs use CcMode.

For an integrated environment with advanced features use [[CEDET]].

For building indexes and running searches on definitions of C source code use EmacsTags.  The GnuGlobal is also popular.

For DebuggingWithEmacs use the GrandUnifiedDebugger.

* Lisp:c-toggle-dot-pointer.el -- Add-on for C programming that allows toggling a variable in a function between pointer and non-pointer while simultaneously toggling between "." and "->" for pointer references in that function.
* http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CProgrammingLanguage/zjl-hl.el -- Add-on to highlight all of the function call and local variable. I use the semantic and some additional keywords to achieve this. This zjl-hl.el needs my another package: region-list-edit.el
