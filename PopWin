== Overview ==

popwin is a popup window manager for Emacs which makes you free from the hell of annoying buffers such like <code>*Help*</code>, <code>*Completions*</code>, <code>*compilation*</code>, and etc.

Take an example. When you complete file names during <code>find-file</code>, the (annoying) <code>*Completions*</code> buffer will appear in a newly splitted window. You might understand the necessity of the window, but you may wonder why the window still remains after completion...

popwin resolves there problems. Windows of such temporary buffers will be shown as a popup window, and you can close them smoothly by typing <code>C-g</code> in anytime.

This doesn't seem to work when using split buffer with one buffer being ERC. Clue? -- [new:RyanDavis:2011-03-08 10:53 UTC]
