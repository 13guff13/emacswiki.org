I am an emacs fan. I use emacs on linux (both X window and tty), and windows as well. By using emacs, I am now os-insensitive, and working happily, mouseless. ;)

I create my color-theme by modifying the "tty-dark" in the color-theme library, so that it almost presents the same view on either a console or a window. Here the problem is that only 8 colors are available to emacs on a tty.

ps. It is another story. I tried the TERM xterm-256colors (and also some other terms): by M-x list-color-display in emacs, I got a list of 256 color names, but still only 8 colors were shown. I googled, but found no answer...

So I have to pick the color carefully for a consistent view. Now it is satisfying to me when I am programming in C/C++ and elisp. Here it is.
