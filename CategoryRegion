This page is about Emacs regions and the different operations and commands for manipulating the region.

Click on the heading above to list '''all''' pages related to ''regions''.

=The Emacs Region=

The [[region]], [[point]], and [[mark]]. 

The [[active region]] is essentially what some other programs call the "selection".

== Emacs Region Vanilla Usage ==

* BasicNarrowing -- Isolates the region, so you can limit operations to region text.  See also [[Narrowing]].
* CopyAndPaste -- Alternatives to default KillingAndYanking for copying, killing, and yanking.
* CopyWithoutSelection -- Simply copy current line, current word and current paragraph to the kill-ring without select to each line, each word or each paragraph 
* CopyingWholeLines -- Different ways of copying an entire line to the kill-ring.
* DeleteSelectionMode -- Replaces the region with what you type. Backspace (DEL) deletes the region.
* KillingAndYanking -- The default Emacs behavior for copying, killing (cutting), and yanking (pasting).
* TransientMarkMode -- Highlights the region whenever it is active (you can activate it using `C-x C-x').
* PcSelectionMode -- Treats the region like MS Windows and Motif.
* ShiftSelectMode -- Expand regions with Shift and a navigation command.



===Emacs Has a Second Selection ===

Yes, Virginia, there is a ''second'' selection.  The SecondarySelection is like the region, but is less 
ephemeral. Learn to use it.
* EmacsIdeasApplyRegionFunctionOnMultipleRegions
** ApplyFunctionOnMultipleRegions -- Applies a function to several regions at the same time.



===Rectangles - Regions with a Twist===
* RectangleCommands -- Operate on the column of text between point and mark.
** RectangleMark -- Highlights rectangular areas instead of a continuous stretches of text.
** RectangleAdd -- Adds the numbers in a rectangle.



== Extensions of Vanilla Region Handling ==

* AnchoredTranspose -- Transposes a phrase around an anchor phrase. In other words it swaps 2 regions.
* [[Anything|anything-show-kill-ring]] -- Narrow `kill-ring' using multiple patterns.
* AutoMark -- Push a mark after selected commands
* [[Bookmark+]] -- ''Name'' regions and make them ''persistent''. Revisit bookmark to visit and activate region.
* ChangingCursorDynamically -- Find the region easily by making the [[cursor]] more visible when Emacs is idle.
* CuaMode -- Use key bindings compatible with the Common User Access (CUA) system
* EevMode -- `M-x eev' saves region to a temporary script. Later we can execute it.
* FastNav -- Set mark quickly at the next/previous nth occurence of a character while [[point]] is kept.
* HideRegion -- Hide and show multiple regions.
* [[Icicles]] -- Persistent, multiple regions as [[bookmark]]s. Select a bookmarked region, search one, etc. -- [[Icicles - Bookmark Enhancements]]
* [[IndirectBuffers#IndirectRegion]] -- Edit a region of text in a different mode.
* MarkLines -- Keyboard emulation of triple-click line selection. (Incompatible with CUAMode.)
* ModeLinePosition -- Show the size of the region in the mode-line, whenever region is active in TransientMarkMode.
* MousePlus -- Highlight the yank position while you press `mouse-2', so you hit the right spot.
* Move region -- MoveLine, MoveLineRegion, MoveRegion, MoveText.
* MultipleNarrowings -- Use `##C-x n x x x...##' to cycle a ring of narrowings (buffer restrictions).
* SelectiveUndo -- Undo changes within the region.
* [[Subedit]] -- Edit part of a buffer in a new buffer.
* SwapRegions -- Swap two regions.
* <tt>[[trans-regions.el]]</tt> -- Transpose regions.
* VisibleMark -- Make the mark position visible

* HighlightTemporarily -- Highlight a region (includes marker pens etc.).
