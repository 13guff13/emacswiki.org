I'm a paralegal, professional writer, professional Web developer (in the midst of a career change) and general-purpose computer geek. I've been using Emacs since about 1992. Presently, I run Emacs on all three of my primary working systems (Win32/Cygwin, Mac OS X 10.3 and UbuntuLinux) for writing, research, note-taking, organization (via OrgMode), etc.

Welcome to the wiki! Glad to see there is a future possible even for
geeks :)
