I'm a paralegal, professional writer, professional Web developer (in the midst of a career change) and general-purpose computer geek. I've been using Emacs since about 1992. Presently, I run Emacs on all three of my primary working systems (Win32/Cygwin, Mac OS X 10.3 and UbuntuLinux) for writing, research, note-taking, organization (via OrgMode), etc.

Welcome to the wiki! Glad to see there is a future possible even for
geeks :)

If I am being obtuse please delete this comment, but I arrived on this page via http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CategoryDotEmacs and was looking for an Emacs InitFile. Even after visiting every page on her linked site I cannot seem to find one. Which seems to make this page rather pointless.

The page isn't pointless, but the link is mystifying.  I've mailed Tammy to verify it.
