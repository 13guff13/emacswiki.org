The directory ##~/.emacs.d/## is a standard location for '''additional per-user Emacs-specific files'''. Various packages store information in this directory. Since it is located in the home directory (##~/##), it is unique for each user, just like the ##~/.emacs## [[init file]]. Note that as ##.emacs.d## begins with a dot, it is normally '''hidden''' on Unix systems and only turns up in directory listings if all files and folders are shown (##ls -a##).

Starting with Emacs 22, if ##~/.emacs## does not exist, Emacs will try ##~/.emacs.d/init.el## and ##~/.emacs.d/init.elc##. You can also put the shell init file ##.emacs_SHELL## under ##~/.emacs.d##.

Starting with Emacs 23, the variable ##user-emacs-directory## holds the location of ##.emacs.d##. On '''Windows''', the location depends on the ##HOME## environment variable: if set to ##C:\##, then ##.emacs## is located at ##C:\.emacs## and ##.emacs.d## at ##C:\.emacs.d##.

The user directory itself is not part of ##load-path## and because it contains other things but libraries as mentioned above you should leave it at that.  Instead you should install packages in a dedicated sub-directory and [[LoadPath#AddSubDirectories|add that]] to the ##load-path## instead.
