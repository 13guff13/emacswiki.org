The command `M-x goto-address' is a builtin Emacs feature to highlight all URLs and mail addresses, so that you can browse them or mail them using mouse button-2 (or mouse button-1 starting in Emacs 22).  Available in GnuEmacs and [[XEmacs]] (in the FSF compat package, I assume).

See Manual:goto-address

The library is maintained at GIT:goto-addr.el

This mode will be renamed `goto-address-mode' in Emacs 23.
