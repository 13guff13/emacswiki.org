This is a work-in-progress workaround for the issue of large minified files of programming code bringing Emacs to its knees on account of the relevant modes not being (remotely) optimised for that use-case.

See the Commentary of ##so-long.el## for more details.

==Download==

Download the library from Lisp:so-long.el

==Install==

Place the library somewhere in your Emacs load-path (or use ##M-x package-install-file## for the downloaded file), and add ##(when (require 'so-long nil :noerror) (so-long-enable))## to your init file.
