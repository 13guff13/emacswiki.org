This is a work-in-progress workaround for the issue of large minified files of programming code (i.e., code that has been
compacted into the smallest file size possible, which often entails removing
newlines should they not be strictly necessary) bringing Emacs to its knees on account of the relevant modes not being (remotely) optimised for that use-case.

When the lines in a buffer are /so long/ that performance could suffer to an unacceptable degree, we say "so long"[sup]1[/sup] to the buffer's major mode, and invoke something much more basic in its place.

See the Commentary of ##so-long.el## for more details.

[sup]1[/sup] farewell, auf wiedersehen, etc...

==Download==

Download the library from Lisp:so-long.el

==Install==

Place the library somewhere in your Emacs load-path (or use ##M-x package-install-file## for the downloaded file), and add the following to your init file:

 (when (require 'so-long nil :noerror)
   (so-long-enable))
