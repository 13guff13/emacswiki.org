GNU Emacs development is switching from CVS to [http://bazaar-vcs.org Bzr].  This page is about making that switchover go smoothly.

[:Where]
== Latest Test Repository (2009-11-11) ==

Use http://bzr.notengoamigos.org/emacs-merges.tar.gz or 
http://bzr.notengoamigos.org/emacs-merges.tar.lzma (latter is 2 megs smaller; otherwise they're the same).  See the [http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2009-11/msg00314.html thread about it].

== Checklist ==

* Test the conversion.

* Rename and rewrite INSTALL.CVS.  (Just rename to "INSTALL.DEV", so it's not VC-specific anymore?)

* Make sure Loggerhead or some other repository web browsing software is installed on Savannah.  (Seems to be [http://savannah.gnu.org/support/index.php?106612#comment16 done] now, but may still need some [https://savannah.gnu.org/support/index.php?106612#comment17 debugging].

* Test that anon access works.

* Test that SSH dev access works.

* Make sure commit emails work.
** Fix the email diff generator, if necessary; see https://savannah.gnu.org/support/?106531

* Update http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/.

* Update http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/emacs.

=== Nice-to-Haves ===

These things can be done after the switchover, we just shouldn't forget them:

* Prepare a switchover document for regular Emacs developers (base it on [http://bazaar-vcs.org/Scenarios/RepeatedContributions this scenario]), so they don't all have to read the entire [http://doc.bazaar-vcs.org/bzr.dev/en/user-guide/index.html Bzr Users Guide] to continue working on Emacs.
** See [[BzrForEmacsDevs#RegularContributors]]

* Prepare one-off contribution document (base it on [http://bazaar-vcs.org/Scenarios/OneOffContribution this scenario])
** See [[BzrForEmacsDevs#PatchContributors]]

* Document how to do a release from bzr (or adjust our existing release procedure documentation... where is it, anyway?) Possibly ...emacs/admin/FOR-RELEASE
** See [[BzrForEmacsDevs#Releases]]
