= GNU Emacs Is Now In Bazaar =

**2009-12-27:** GNU Emacs has now switched from CVS to [http://bazaar.canonical.com Bazaar].  Please see [[BzrForEmacsDevs]] for more.

[:Where]
== Where Are the Emacs Sources Now? ==

See [[BzrForEmacsDevs#WhereIsEmacs]]

== Post-Switchover Checklist ==

* Get bzr+ssh access working, so we don't have to use sftp.  See [[https://savannah.gnu.org/support/?107077 sr #107077]].

* Make sure commit emails work.

** Fix the email diff generator, if necessary.  See [[https://savannah.gnu.org/support/?106531 sr #106531]].

* Update http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/.

* Update http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/emacs. (There are four different VCS repositories including the bzr one.  This page should state clearly that Bazaar is the master.)

* Update http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/#Obtaining //("The GNU Emacs development sources are available via a CVS repository hosted on savannah.gnu.org. For details, see the Emacs project page.")//

* Update [[CategoryBuilding]] (that page and a lot of pages linked from there instruct that latest Emacs should be fetched from CVS).

* Document how to do a release from bzr (or adjust our existing release procedure documentation... where is it, anyway?) Possibly ...emacs/admin/FOR-RELEASE
** See [[BzrForEmacsDevs#Releases]]
