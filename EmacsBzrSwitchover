== Emacs CVS â†’ BZR Switchover Checklist ==

GNU Emacs development is switching from CVS to [http://bazaar-vcs.org Bzr].  This is a checklist of things we need to do to make that switchover go smoothly.

* Prepare a switchover document for regular Emacs developers (base it on [http://bazaar-vcs.org/Scenarios/RepeatedContributions this scenario]), so they don't all have to read the entire [http://doc.bazaar-vcs.org/bzr.dev/en/user-guide/index.html Bzr Users Guide] to continue working on Emacs.
** See [[BzrForEmacsDevs#RegularContributors]]

* Prepare one-off contribution document (base it on [http://bazaar-vcs.org/Scenarios/OneOffContribution this scenario])
** See [[BzrForEmacsDevs#PatchContributors]]

* Figure out how to handle external repositories (basically Gnus's), which is sync'd *both* ways (currently going via Arch).
** See [[BzrForEmacsDevs#PackageMerging]]

* Document how to do a release from bzr (or adjust our existing release procedure documentation... where is it, anyway?) Possibly ...emacs/admin/FOR-RELEASE
** See [[BzrForEmacsDevs#Releases]]

* Set up a test branch.

* Test the test branch!

* Rename and rewrite INSTALL.CVS.  (Just rename to "INSTALL.DEV", so it's not VC-specific anymore?)

* Make sure Loggerhead or some other repository web browsing software is installed on Savannah.  (Seems to be [http://savannah.gnu.org/support/index.php?106612#comment16 done] now, but may still need some [https://savannah.gnu.org/support/index.php?106612#comment17 debugging].

* Test that anon access works.

* Test that SSH dev access works.

* Make sure commit emails work.
** Fix the email diff generator, if necessary; see https://savannah.gnu.org/support/?106531

* Update http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/.

* Update http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/emacs.
