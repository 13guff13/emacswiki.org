==About==

Make-color (macol) is a package for choosing a color by updating text
sample with r/g/b/... keys to see how the color looks in the context.

Full documentation and source code can be found on
[http://github.com/alezost/make-color.el github repo].

==Installation==

Put "make-color.el" into a directory from `load-path' and add the
following autoloads to your .emacs:

    (autoload 'macol-make-color "make-color" nil t)
    (autoload 'macol-switch-to-buffer "make-color" nil t)

==Usage==

* Select any region (it will be used as a text sample).

* M-x macol-make-color

* Select a region and press "n": this text will be set for updating its
foreground / background color.

* Press keys to change a color of the probing region:

** r/R, g/G, b/B – decrease/increase red, green, blue components (RGB model)
** c/C, m/M, y/Y – decrease/increase cyan, magenta, yellow components (RGB model)
** h/H, s/S, l/L – decrease/increase hue, saturation, luminance (HSL model)
** RET – change current color (prompt for a value)

:: See mode description (C-h m) for other available keys.
