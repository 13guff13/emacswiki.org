I'm sorry because I assume what I'm about to ask is a very novice questions. I'm super new to emacs so please understand...
I'm really annoyed by the loud "ding" sound of the bell and I would love to change the sound to something else and also the volume of it. I see the code you provided (thank you!) but I'm too stupid/novice to know how to use the code in emacs... Where am I suppose to put the code? Please teach me... thank you!!
