I'm an embedded firmware developer who has been using Emacs since 1983.  Thought it was about time I started giving back.

I'm currently using emacs on windows, but occasionally use it on Sun OS as well.  My primary use is for C/C++, Java and various scripting languages.

I recently wrote a major mode for Procomm Aspect scripts at Lisp:procomm-mode.el.
