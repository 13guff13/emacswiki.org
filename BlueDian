==About me==

Hi all,

I'm an Emacs fan from several years (since 2000) now. I use Emacs 23 on Ubuntu.

I'm a french Ass. professor (sorry for my bad English) working on Software Engineering.

Fan of Gnus and org-mode (still trying to master them).

Facing an emacs bankrupcy, I'm currently looking for differents autoloaders and package installer, like :
* [[Grail]]
* [[ELPA]]
* [[Pases]]
* InstallElisp
* AutoInstall
* ...


After some experiments, I will try to send some feedbacks
