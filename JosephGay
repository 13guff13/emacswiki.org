I use Emacs

* IM at work and at home using JabberEl (gilleylen on google talk)
* reading and composing mail over IMAP using [[Mew]]
* web browsing (mostly technical docs) using [[w3m]]
* server administration using TrampMode
* twitter via TwIt
* note taking and writing in OrgMode
* i try to keep a learning log using RememberMode
* SlimeMode for hacking on clojure and sbcl (in my spare time)

I am a vim convert. I used ViperMode for a few months, but I've now
dropped it completely. My transition was motivated initially by
Slime, and finally by the gradual realization that Emacs is the only
truly fun software package I've ever used.

Things I'd like to try/get working:
* Gnus---is it worth all the effort?
* something to replace Google Reader, perhaps NewsTicker, Gnus?

Things that will make Emacs cooler (if that's possible):
* [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Google_Wave_for_Emacs Google Wave for Emacs]
* Emacs webkit and/or gecko integration (maybe something like ezbl)
