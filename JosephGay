ysph on #emacs and http://twitter.com/ysph

I use GNU Emacs

* IM at work and at home using JabberEl and bitlbee (gilleylen on google talk)
* reading and composing mail over IMAP using [[Mew]]
* web browsing (mostly technical docs) using [[w3m]]
* server administration using TrampMode
* twitter via TwIt
* note taking and writing in OrgMode
* i try to keep a learning log using RememberMode
* SlimeMode for hacking on clojure and sbcl (in my spare time)

I am a vim convert. I used ViperMode for a few months, but I've now
dropped it completely. My transition was motivated initially by
Slime, and finally by the gradual realization that Emacs is the only
truly fun software package I've ever used.

Things I'd like to try/get working:
* Gnus---is it worth all the effort?

** I started with gnus (I learned emacs only because of Gnus), and I really
   like it, especially with a local IMAP server (Dovecot) to speed things up,
   and notmuch for fast email searches.  I have nearly 100.000 mails, and
   Gnus/notmuch make it managable. -- TassiloHorn

* something to replace Google Reader, perhaps NewsTicker, Gnus?

** I use newsticker, but with the plain interface, not the fancy tree view. For
   me, it does all I need, and it does work with any format.  The last time I
   tried gnus for that, it had some troubles with some feeds. -- TassiloHorn

Things that will make Emacs cooler (if that's possible):
* [[Google Wave for Emacs]]
* Emacs webkit and/or gecko integration (maybe something like ezbl)

Welcome to the wiki! :) As for the webkit stuff, did you take a look at EmacsXembed? -- AlexSchroeder

Alex, Thanks for the welcome :) I've been looking at ezbl, which uses
EmacsXembed to embed uzbl. -- JosephGay
