Emacs can sort.  It can sort lines, paragraphs, pages.  It can sort by fields, columns or even RegularExpression.  It is not as specific as the unix ##sort(1)## command.

; `M-x sort-lines': Sort lines in the region.
; `C-x h M-x sort-lines': Sort all lines in the buffer.
; `C-u M-x sort-lines': Sort lines in the region in reverse order.
; `M-x sort-numeric-fields': Sort lines in the region numerically.
; `M-x sort-numeric-fields M-x reverse-region': Sort lines numerically in reverse.
; `M-x sort-paragraphs': Sort by paragraph in region.
; `C-u M-x sort-paragraphs': Sort paragraphs in reverse.
; `M-x sort-pages': Sort by page in region.
; `C-u M-x sort-pages': Sort pages in reverse.
; `C-u 2 M-x sort-field': Sort lines by second field in region, where fields are separated by any whitespace.
; `C-u 2 M-x sort-field M-x reverse-region': Sort lines by second field in reverse.
; `M-x sort-columns': Sort the lines the region "covers" using the columns between region beginning and end.
