Hi

I'm an emacs user since about 2004 and I use it every day and find it endlessly fun. I did use it once in about 1992 on my Commodore Amiga and a few years later on a PC, but it seemed like a lot of hard work. However once I got the time and inclination to get over the learning hump it became a very powerful tool for me.

I have the name [::justinhj] on many services including twitter and gmail.
