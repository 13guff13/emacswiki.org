The EdiffTrees package is a simple frontend to EdiffMode
to allow a simpler comparison of two similar directory
trees.

I wrote this package because I often need to compare two different
versions of the same directory tree and ediff-directories is not
very helpful in this case.  Specially when the directory trees to
compare are deep and only a few files have changed.

For further instructions, please see the comentary in the file.

: Lisp:ediff-trees.el

Any comments are welcomed, of course.

There seems to be something wrong with the link above.

Somebody uploaded a file instead of just pasting the elisp into the text area... -- AlexSchroeder

Oops, I've fixed that with the update to a new version of the package.

I did something similar with the concept of secondary project roots. The example code is pasted in [[EdiffMode]]. I shall have a play with your mode :-)

i've been looking for this functionality for a long time. getting "function definition is void: eql" errors on diffs (everything i've tried so far), even for simple directories that only differ in one line of 1 file. any thoughts ? using emacs 21.2.1
