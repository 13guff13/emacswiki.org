This library allows for a set of shell commands to be linked with file or directory names. Used in [[DiredMode]], these commands can then be run using `dired-do-shell-command' (or pressing "!").

Features: 

* Provides a widget.el interface to add, edit, and sort shell commands.

* Gets rid of the "A command is running - kill it? Yes or No?" message.

* Hides the stdout buffer if `runner-run-in-background' is set to t. Can be disabled for specific commands if the command string contains `{run:out}'.

* Uses `runner-shell-function' instead of `shell-command' if command string contains `{run:shell}'.

Since this library modifies the behavior of `dired-guess-shell-alist-user', make sure you understand the command syntax of that variable (see the documentation of `dired-guess-shell-alist-user' for more).

==Download==

Lisp:runner.el

== Install ==

Put this file in your Emacs-Lisp load path, and add the following
into your startup file (i.e., $HOME/.emacs).

 (require 'runner)

== Usage ==

While in dired mode, position point on any file or directory you
wish to add a shell command to, then do:

 M-x runner-add-file (for file or directory names)
 M-x runner-add-extension (for file extension)

A new buffer will be created allowing you to specify what commands
to run.

A file name or extension can be linked to multiple set of
commands. You can view and edit which pattern is being applied to a
file by positioning point on a file and running,

 M-x runner-edit-file-at-point

You can also add, edit, or delete any specific pattern by doing:

 M-x runner-add-empty
 M-x runner-edit
 M-x runner-delete

The command database will be saved to the variable
`runner-init-file' (default is "~/.emacs.d/runner-conf.el"). You
may choose a different location by doing:

 M-x customize-variable runner-init-file
