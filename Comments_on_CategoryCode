I disagree with the change that was made, separating Completion UI, DoReMi, and Icicles from CategoryExtension.  Makes no sense.

I think the Code page is very long and could use some splitting up. The way I see it, the Code category currently has pages that teach people about coding and pages that help people to write code (libraries or extensions).

Thus, I approve of the split Roland made.
