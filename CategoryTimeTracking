There are several modes to help you track the time spent on various activities and do reporting.

* TimeClock - part of emacs
* Extensions to TimeClock: Lisp:timeclock-x.el
* Groups:timelog.el - written by Thomas Gehrlein (posted on gnu.emacs.sources)
* WorklogMode - another mode by KaiGrossjohann
* Alan Shutko's [http://web.springies.com/~ats/emacs/project.el|project.el]
* [http://github.com/chrisdone/emacsworktracker/|worktracker.el] - timeclock-alike with helpful ido prompts and emphasis on hitting quick keys for dealing with being interrupted. -- ChrisDone

PlannerMode has a quite useful feature to time your tasks using timeclock.

OrgMode also has time tracking and reporting.
