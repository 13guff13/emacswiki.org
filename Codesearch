Codesearch is a source code indexing system, similar to ctags, based on the now-defunct Google Code Search. It is designed to handle huge code bases with very high performance.

Codesearch.el allows you to interact with codesearch from emacs. In particular, it lets you search an index with a regular expression and select from the matches in a results buffer.
