This may be of help if you are having trouble with Emacs
finding a font even though you have installed it correctly. On
my system Emacs could not find the fonts "Dai Banna SIL Book"
and "BabelStone Phags-pa Book." The solution was to append
":style=Regular" to the names.  In the first case each font
style was in a separate file so this may have been the reason
this was necessary but I couldn't see any reason for it in the
second.

Is it possible to use Emacs fontsets outside Emacs? Having
spent a long time setting up the fonts as I want them in
Emacs, it strikes me that Emacs uses a fontset as if it were
one big unicode font. It would be nice if this "font" could
somehow be made available to other applications, perhaps by
making Emacs into a font server. Is there any way this could
be done?
