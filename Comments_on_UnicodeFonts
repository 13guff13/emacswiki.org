This may be of help if you are having trouble with Emacs
finding a font even though you have installed it correctly. On
my system Emacs could not find the fonts "Dai Banna SIL Book"
and "!BabelStone Phags-pa Book." The solution was to append
":style=Regular" to the names.  In the first case each font
style was in a separate file so this may have been the reason
this was necessary but I couldn't see any reason for it in the
second.

Is it possible to use Emacs fontsets outside Emacs? Having
spent a long time setting up the fonts as I want them in
Emacs, it strikes me that Emacs uses a fontset as if it were
one big unicode font. It would be nice if this "font" could
somehow be made available to other applications, perhaps by
making Emacs into a font server. Is there any way this could
be done?

I added variants for these two font names with ":style=Regular" on github. What platform are you running?

Also, I hope you installed from marmalade or github rather than the versions hosted on the wiki, as performance is improved.

As to using Emacs as a font server -- I suppose that fontsets are weighed down by historical considerations to which other applications would not be willing to subscribe.

If you have any other tips from your font configuration feel free to send them along for inclusion here or (better) file an issue on github.  I'm certain that many additional fonts ought to be included.
