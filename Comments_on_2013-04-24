Discussion of the bootstrap configâ€¦

----

On my iPhone, I noticed that the footer is too narrow and the header takes up too much space (three lines).

Using Firefox on my Mac, the checkbox seems to be misaligned with the label.

Sharp.  Nice work Alex and Evgkeni!

Just one user --- I disabled it.

Too wide, for one thing, and text truncated at browser edge instead of wrapped.  Plus changing the text size in the brower has no effect (so less accessible in this respect also).  Not to mention ochre/orange text on off-white background; a non-serif font that makes many uppercase and lowercase letters practically indistinguishable,...

'''Generally less readable than the old default.'''  The ''default'' should be as accessible as possible, IMHO.  Those wanting something (that they find) more asthetically pleasing can opt ''in'' for that.

Here's what I see in my browser (IE7, and it's similar in Google Chrome --- images scaled to 75% here).  Even ignoring the problems with the top of the page, there is a lot more information visible in the actual text area of the old compared to the new.

==== New style: ====
[[image:newwikistyle]]

==== Old style: ====
[[image:oldwikistyle]]

The current design does not seem to properly support zooming in Chromium browser which makes the site totally unusuable for me.

I disagree with the above statement, that "the default should be as accessible as possible". A fancy default with a simple fallback can be very reasonable. But, in all honesty, the css could use some work:

The body is very wide which makes it annoying to read, some simple fixes are:

{{{
.wrapper,.span12 {
    max-width: 960px;
  }
  @media (max-width:480px){
      h1 { font-size: 1.8em; }
      .footer .legal {
          margin: 70px 5px 5px !important;
      }
  }
}}}

This could just be added to bootstrap.css. Bootstrap also has some nice code to make a small collapsable menu on smaller screens.

Thanks for the work, looking forward to version 2.0.1.

Using lots of "grey contrast" does make a site look more stylish if you're not actually spending much time reading it, but the decreased contrast also decreases readability for many of us (especially if you no longer have the eyesight of a teenager).  The styling of comments here now is a particularly bad example, now being dark grey against light grey, forcing me to squint to read them.  Please choose solid contrasts, rather than shades of grey, it tends to give me a headache. Thanks.

Perhaps add some simple borders for tables.

{{{
table.user {
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    box-shadow: 0 0 1em #eee;
}
table.user tbody tr td {
    padding: 0.1em 0.25em;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
}
}}}

Concerning John's squinting:

The default text is dark (#333) on gray (#eee) a difference of #bbb (3003).

Comments are gray text (#888) on white (#fff) a difference of #777 (1911).  If it was changed to #444, it would be the same contrast.

Thank you all for your feedback and the CSS suggestions.

I added [http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/base-css.html#tables bootstrap default table style] to all tables. Examples: [Self:action=history;id=Comments_on_2013-04-24 page history], [[Reference Sheet by Aaron Hawley]].

I made some changes to the footer for iPhones "@media (max-width:480px)" and hid the CC logo, made the legal blurb wider, etc. I also fiddled with the header a bit in order to make it waste less space.

I also made the "comments" when you use ##[new]## on a page darker. Examples: [[2013-03-19]], EmacsWikiProblems.

FWIW, I agree with Johnw , I like the modern look but IMHO contrast is not good.

Twitter Bootstrap is a very nice starter for websites. [http://bootswatch.com/spacelab/ Bootswatch] has some good examples what can be done easily. Maybe some of the alternatives to the current css could be had from there? They are like color-themes for Bootstrap.

Some good pointers on readability cab be found on [http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/05/02/applying-macrotypography-for-readable-web-page/ smashing-magazine]. Some more adjustments to the contrast and margins might improve readability a lot.

As someone mentioned on #emacs, the logo (wich does not link back to http://www.emacswiki.org/ btw) is chosen a bit poorly: ew doesn't sound very positive.

TBT, I've spent around a day on the layout, my goal being making something a little bit more interesting. I mostly changed bits that affected many pages, and didn't pay as much attention to details.

I don't think the gray background affects readability for most people - after all many people use low-contrast themes in emacs.

I think the criticism regrading the page width is valid. The best width readability-wise would probably be around 600. 900 is not as good, but it doesn't create a situation where the margins are bigger than the body on a wide-screen.

I will have a closer look at IE7 and IE8, and perhaps some things could be improved. Then again I don't think they are used much among computer-savvy users - which the particular website targets.

Even though I disabled the new design, it is now showing up at ElispArea.

-- DrewAdams 2013-04-25 14:47 UTC

I suppose the readability might improve a little if the default text color where changed from #333 to #000.

It might be possible to fix the lack flexibility on IE7/IE8 if some "width"s where substituted with "max-width"s.
