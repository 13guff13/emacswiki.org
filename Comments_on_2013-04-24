Discussion of the bootstrap configâ€¦

----

On my iPhone, I noticed that the footer is too narrow and the header takes up too much space (three lines).

Sharp.  Nice work Alex and Evgkeni!

Just one user --- I disabled it.

Too wide, for one thing, and text truncated at browser edge instead of wrapped.  Plus changing the text size in the brower has no effect (so less accessible in this respect also).  Not to mention ochre/orange text on off-white background; a non-serif font that makes many uppercase and lowercase letters practically indistinguishable,...

'''Generally less readable than the old default.'''  The ''default'' should be as accessible as possible, IMHO.  Those wanting something (that they find) more asthetically pleasing can opt ''in'' for that.

Here's what I see in my browser (IE7, and it's similar in Google Chrome --- images scaled to 75% here).  Even ignoring the problems with the top of the page, there is a lot more information visible in the actual text area of the old compared to the new.

==== New style: ====
[[image:newwikistyle]]

==== Old style: ====
[[image:oldwikistyle]]

The current design does not seem to properly support zooming in Chromium browser which makes the site totally unusuable for me.

I disagree with the above statement, that "the default should be as accessible as possible". A fancy default with a simple fallback can be very reasonable. But, in all honesty, the css could use some work:

The body is very wide which makes it annoying to read, some simple fixes are:

{{{
.wrapper,.span12 {
    max-width: 960px;
  }
  @media (max-width:480px){
      h1 { font-size: 1.8em; }
      .footer .legal {
          margin: 70px 5px 5px !important;
      }
  }
}}}

This could just be added to bootstrap.css. Bootstrap also has some nice code to make a small collapsable menu on smaller screens.

Thanks for the work, looking forward to version 2.0.1.

Perhaps add some simple borders for tables.

{{{
table.user {
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    box-shadow: 0 0 1em #eee;
}
table.user tbody tr td {
    padding: 0.1em 0.25em;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
}
}}}
