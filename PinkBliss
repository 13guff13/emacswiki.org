Get it here:

* Lisp:pink-bliss.el
* [[pink-gnu.xpm]] (image required for the tool-bar based on [http://www.gnu.org/graphics/heckert_gnu.html Heckertâ€™s bold gnu head])

The current version of the code no longer requires ColorTheme.
Conversely, it no longer integrates nicely with Emacs' own Custom code.
The benefit is that it is simpler to hack, now.

The current version also requires an _image_!
It switches on the toolbar, removes all the icons, adds a kitten, and binds
a very simple defun to the button:
If the current buffer is modified, a click will save the buffer.
If the current buffer has been saved, a click will open a new file.

: Gha ! :) Really nice :)

I just heard that the Hello Kitty! color theme was implemented and after having seen it I think it is just as I had imagined it (though I think the region hilight would look better if it was pure white).

My next challenge is a color theme called Eye Cancer. :)
