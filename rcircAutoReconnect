Being very annoyed with rcirc not knowing how to automatically reconnect I ([[avar]]) hacked that feature in with a custom connect function, hooks and hackery:

* http://git.nix.is/?p=avar/emacs-conf;a=blob_plain;f=50-packages-rcirc.el;hb=master
* http://git.nix.is/?p=avar/emacs-conf;a=blob_plain;f=host/oe.el;hb=master

I hope this is useful for somebody else.
