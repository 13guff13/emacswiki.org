I rolled back your edits of general, English pages such as CategoryDirectories, CategoryCommands, CategoryHypermedia, and KeyboardMacros. Please do not change the language of a page.  Instead, create a new, translated page in your language (e.g. Chinese).  See this page for info: HowLanguagesWork.  To save time when creating the new pages, you can use your previous edits - they are available by clicking `History' for the pages I rolled back.  Thanks -- DrewAdams

ok, Thanks a lot!

I see you are still having trouble creating a proper translation page without changing the original page to Chinese. I'm not familiar with this myself.  Hopefully, someone can let you know the proper way to do it. -- DrewAdams
