The usual way to create a [[tags file]] is to run `etags' from the command
line. Example:

    etags *.el

Or to build a tags file for a source tree (e.g. the linux kernel) you can use something like:

    find . -type f -iname "*.[ch]" | etags -L -

See also RecursiveTags.

Avoid using `xargs' with `etags' (e.g. ##find . -type f -iname "*.[ch]" | xargs etags##).  For source trees with many files, xargs will execute etags multiple times, overwriting the previous tags file on each execution.

Or to build the tags file within Emacs, put this in your [[init file]]:

  (defun create-tags (dir-name)
     "Create tags file."
     (interactive "DDirectory: ")
     (eshell-command 
      (format "find %s -type f -name \"*.[ch]\" | etags -L -" dir-name)))

This package provides a function which rebuilds the tags file being
used by the current buffer. You can pre-configure the shell command
based on the tag file being built.

Also, Lisp:traverselisp.el is able to build tags fast recursively in a directory tree:

M-x traverse-build-tags-in-project

then just choose extension from prompt.
