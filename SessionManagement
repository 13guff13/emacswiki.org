"Session Management" is the act of saving what you are doing when you quit
Emacs (and end your session) and restoring as much as possible and useful
next time you start Emacs (and want to resume your previous session).

* DeskTop -- saves and restores all open buffers
* WcyDesktop -- similar to DeskTop, but faster by defering loading file.
* Desktopaid -- saves and restores frames (http://desktopaid.sourceforge.net/)
* WindowsMode -- comes with revive.el, which can save and restore window configurations
* PolicySwitch -- Arranges window configurations in lists called policies.  Can save/restore the configurations.
* FrameRestorePackage -- save and restore [[Frame]] configurations
* EmacsSession -- ##session.el## saves global variables, registers, and buffer positions, but doesn't reload visited files like DeskTop does
* SavePlace -- point goes to the last place where it was when you previously visited the same file
* SaveHist -- simpler than most of the above: By default, it just saves your MiniBuffer histories.

A special program keeps track of [[WThreeMSession]]s.
