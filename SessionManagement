"Session Management" is the act of saving some of what you are doing  and restoring it later. Often your current state is saved when you quit
Emacs and restored when you start a new session.


* [[BookmarkPlus|Bookmark+]] -- [[DeskTop]]s as bookmarks: just hit a
  key to create them or jump among them.
* DeskTop -- Save and restore open [[buffer]]s, [[point]], [[mark]],
  histories, other [[variable]]s.
* [[http://desktopaid.sourceforge.net/ DesktopAid]] -- Save and
  restore [[frame]]s.
* DesktopMenu -- DeskTop extension that lets you manage multiple
  desktops, possibly in a single directory.
* MkDesktop -- For use with DesktopMenu. Automates the creation of
  multiple, named desktops from generated lists of files.
* EmacsSession, ##session.el## -- Save global variables,
  [[register]]s, and buffer positions; does not reload visited files
  like DeskTop does.

* PolicySwitch -- Save and restore window configurations using policies.
* SaveHist -- Save [[minibuffer]] histories and optionally other variables.
* SavePlace -- Restore [[point]].
* TinyDesk -- Save and restore list of saved files (or current Emacs session).

  configurations.

  and window configurations.

I use EmacsSession, because it doesn't reload all the files and doesn't require a lot of customization like DeskTop does. -- AlexSchroeder
