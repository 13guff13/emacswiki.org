I use Emacs.

I use Emacs both at home and at school.

Because I have been subjected to numerous older development environments my desire for full-screen editors caused me at one time to write my own editors.  During my tour of duty as a programmer and analyst I ran across all the usual editor suspects until I dove into Emacs in the late 90's and really never looked back.  I'm learning elisp at the same pace as Emacs development ;-)

I doubt I'll ever completely get rid of Emacs because I keep finding more uses for it.  At home I do a little C and Python programming and HTML (in Emacs).  And for super-trivial Java stuff I find Emacs works easier than firing up my IDE (NetBeans).  If I ever get around to writing a novel I'll be using Emacs exclusively.  There's a lot to be said for a stable editor, and I consider Emacs to be a stable editor.

My function keys (including S-Fx and C-fx) are nearly full with my customizations.  The latest fad of mine is to assign about 4-6 of my S-Fx to find-file my most frequent directories where my current work is.  My latest use for Emacs is for schoolwork, where I'm just typing away madly for homework that requires only essay-like text.

Emacs being slow or resource hungry comes from people who try using Emacs as if it was still vi (or any other standalone text editor) and not as the user-level "operating system" (programmable and multi-purpose) that it is and should be.  Welcome. --AaronHawley

Emacs is open enough to be just about <b>anything</b> a power user wishes it to be.  I'm glad for that.
