I use Emacs.

I use Emacs both at home and at work.

At work I was subjected to Edit Plus -- horrid!  Since it's being used as an external tool to our CVS platform I am working on replacing it with Emacs (have to program a new mode).  Until then I find fundamental-mode "just works" for what I need.  I'm learning elisp at the same pace as Emacs development ;-)

I doubt I'll ever completely get rid of Emacs because I just find more uses for it.  At home I do a little C programming and HTML (in Emacs).  And for super-trivial Java stuff I find Emacs works easier than firing up my IDE (NetBeans).  If I ever get around to writing a novel I'll be using Emacs exclusively.  There's a lot to be said for a stable editor, and I consider Emacs to be a stable editor.

My function keys (including S-Fx and C-fx) are nearly full with my customizations.  The latest fad of mine is to assign about 4-6 of my S-Fx to find-file my most frequent directories where my current work is.

Emacs being slow or resource hungry comes from people who try using Emacs as if it was still vi (or any other standalone text editor) and not as the user-level "operating system" (programmable and multi-purpose) that it is and should be.  Welcome. --AaronHawley

Emacs is open enough to be just about <b>anything</b> a power user wishes it to be.  I'm glad for that.
