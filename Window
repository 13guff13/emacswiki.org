In Emacs-speak, a '''[::window]''' is a [[frame]] pane, that is, a subframe. What is usually called a "window" outside of Emacs is called a '''[[frame]]''' in Emacs.

A window displays the contents of a single ''[[buffer]]''. A buffer need not be displayed in a window, however.

At the bottom of each window is a ModeLine that describes the current buffer status.

Here is a screenshot showing a frame with three windows:

Commonly used window commands include these:

    C-x 0 delete the current window
    C-x 1 maximize the current window
    C-x 2 split the current window horizontally
    C-x 3 split the current window vertically
    C-x ^ make selected window taller
    C-x } make selected window wider
