I have no business using emacs. I am a literary translator and have a hard enough time maintaining discipline without the bottomless sinkhole of twiddling that is emacs. But I love it desperately, with an unrequited love, and have moved all aspects of my computing life into it except for the two holdouts of mail and RSS feeds (I'm using a CVS Carbon build on Leopard). The translation I do could be done as easily in <nowiki>TextEdit</nowiki> (or Notepad, for that matter), but I justify my usage/abusage by employing emacs to maintain [http://paper-republic.org/ Paper Republic], a website (in [http://www.djangoproject.com Django]) about Chinese-English translation. My need to read/write Chinese in emacs has led me into the many dark and abandoned alleyways of unicode, until I saw the 23 light. I'm on IRC as [::girzel].
