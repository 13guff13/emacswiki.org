Scheme-lookup is a modified version of <code>hyperspec.el</code> (see CommonLispHyperspec), seeded with symbols from R5RS, finalized SRFIs and the manuals of several [[Scheme]] systems.  
It allows to simply put the TextCursor over a symbol and hit M-x scheme-lookup to jump to the relevant documentation.

To get scheme-lookup do

  darcs get http://twb.ath.cx/~twb/canon/scheme-lookup/

then follow the instructions at the top of scheme-lookup.el.  It should all be pretty self-explanatory.

(But that site is a dead link as of 2009-10-31).
