From the web page:

: [::ECB] stands for "Emacs Code Browser".  While Emacs already has good
editing support for many modes, its browsing support is somewhat
lacking. That's where ECB comes in: it displays a number of informational
windows that allow for easy source code navigation and overview.

: The informational windows can contain:

* A directory tree,
* a list of source files in the current directory,
* a list of functions/classes/methods/... in the current file, (ECB uses the
  Semantic Bovinator, or Imenu, or etags, for getting this list so all
  languages supported by any of these tools are automatically supported by
  ECB too)
* a history of recently visited files, 
* the Speedbar and
* output from compilation (the "compilation" window) and other modes like
  help, grep etc. or whatever a user defines to be displayed in this window.

: As an added bonus, ECB makes sure to keep these informational windows visible,
even when you use C-x 1 and similar commands.

: It goes without saying that you can configure the layout, ie which
informational windows should be displayed where. ECB comes with a number of
ready-made window layouts to choose from.

: ECB requires:

* Version 1.4 of Eric Ludlam's SemanticBovinator or higher
* Version 0.17 of eieio or higher
* Version 0.15 of speedbar or higher
* Optional: If Java code is edited the ECB works best when the JDEE package
  is installed.

: If you use XEmacs you must have installed the package c-support (contains
hideshow.el). If you want to read the online-help of ECB in HTML-format you
must have the library browse-url (part of the mail-lib XEmacs package)
installed; this package is also needed for submitting problem-reports to the
ECB-maintainers!

To get the development version easily and set it up you can use [NxhtmlMode nXhtml] which has a tool for this in the nXhtml menus (see nXhtml / Tools / ECB).

Has anyone been successful in using ECB (V2.40) with [[emacs23]]?  This version of Emacs has [[CEDET]], semantic and eieio part of the in-built packages.  Quite a few things seem to have changed here though - primary changes being the `provide' statement for semantic - where the following changes have happened (all these are `require'ed from <tt>ecb-cedet-wrapper.el</tt>):

{{{
    ;;; in ecb-cedet-wrapper.el
    (require 'semantic-ctxt)     ;; In emacs 23 this is now 'semantic/ctxt
    (require 'semantic-analyze)  ;; In emacs 23 this is now 'semantic/analyze
    (require 'semantic-db)       ;; In emacs 23 this is now 'semantic/db
    (require 'semantic-db-find)  ;; In emacs 23 this is now 'semantic/db-find
    (require 'semantic-db-mode)  ;; In emacs 23 this is now 'semantic/db-mode
}}}

However, even after making these changes to the ECB cedet wrapper, I am still getting the following error:

<strong>Symbol's value as variable is void: ecb-compilation-buffer-list-changed-p</strong>

I have succeeded in getting ECB 2.40 to at least load cleanly on Emacs 23.2.1 by making the above changes to ecb-cedet-wrapper.el as well as commenting-out the (require 'semantic-load) line in ecb-method-browser.el file (line #44), and in ecb-analyse.el changing the  (require 'semantic-analyze)  line to  (require 'semantic/analyze) .
