I use emacs in my everyday work for about two dozen years.
It's a constant source of amusement and ... pain (the two must come in one bundle
just not necessarily at one time).
/me has just passed through a next one to make gnus searching in indexed
folders, see http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/IndexMail.
