Hi Alex. I've lost the look I've always used. How to regain it? Do I need to go choose it again? (Dunno whether it was Classic, but I will try that, if you say so.) Is there no way for my existing bookmarks to still work, retrieving the same look & feel I had before? -- DrewAdams

Bookmark a link like the following:

* https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=rc;showedit=1;days=3;rollback=1;lang=;theme=;css=/css/emacs.css

(This would be my control-freak version of Recent Changes.)

Alternatively, edit your bookmark and change ##css=## to ##css=/css/emacs.css##. It probably also says ##bootstrap=0## somewhere and that no longer has any effect so you may as well remove it.

My recent-changes bookmark has neither ##ccc=## nor ##bookstrap=##. It is this:

    https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=rc;days=7;all=0;rollback=1;showedit=1

I also have plenty of other Emacs Wiki bookmarks. Here is what I use for the Elisp Area:

    https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ElispArea

Am I supposed to change all of them? Previously, none of my bookmarks needed to contain info about CSS.

I want all pages on the wiki to be rendered in the original, simple style, whether bookmarked or not.
