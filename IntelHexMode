== About intel-hex-mode ==

This is a major mode to allow easy updating of checksums in Intel Hex files. It also does some font-locking and uses the mode line to show addresses and field types. Works on Emacs and XEmacs. The mode will detect and use easymenu if available.

To use intel-hex-mode, add 

    (load-file "PATH_TO_FILE/intel-hex-mode.el")

to your ##~/.emacs(.el)## or ##~/.xemacs/init.el##.

By default, .a90 and .hex files will be recognized.

Use `C-c C-c' to update the current line's checksum, and `C-c C-b' to update the whole buffer.
