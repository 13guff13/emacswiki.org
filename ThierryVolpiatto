Hi, i am Thierry Volpiatto and I use Emacs on Gentoo GNU/linux.

My nickname on IRC is thiedlec.

I contribute to DistributedVersionControl (DVC).

I am also one of the maintainers of 

* Lisp:anything-config.el

* Lisp:bookmark+.el

Here are some elisp codes i wrote:

* Lisp:warn-mail.el Warn you when you have a new mail in your mail directory

* SerialRename is a little code to rename files sequentially

* Lisp:planner-notes-index-page.el To have an index of your notes for each planner page.

(i don't use planner anymore, so this file is not maintened)
