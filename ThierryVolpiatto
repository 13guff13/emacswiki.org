Hi, i am Thierry Volpiatto and I use Emacs on Gentoo GNU/linux.

My nickname on IRC is thiedlec.

I am one of the maintainers of 

* [http://repo.or.cz/w/anything-config.git anything-config.el]

Here are some elisp codes i wrote:

* [http://mercurial.intuxication.org/hg/ioccur ioccur] is IncrementalOccur.

* [http://mercurial.intuxication.org/hg/traverselisp traverselisp] Look at TraverseDirectory for more info.
Mostly deprecated since i have [http://mercurial.intuxication.org/hg/ioccur ioccur], grep and grep recurse in [http://repo.or.cz/w/anything-config.git anything-config.el].
Though some functions still useful.
