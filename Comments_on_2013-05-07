It's nice to have the chance to use a different search; I've been trying DDG for the past month or so. Usually it gets me what I need; sometimes I go back to google. :::sigh:::

Have discoverd snimtheog interesting as for the dates for the 2015 calendar.   Note this cluster of  holidays  and the Fathers called out times. First, Sabbath   will be on the Roman Tuesday. April 2nd, on Thursday at about 7 p.m. is the   last supper memorial, April 3rd in the evening is Passover, the night to be   much remembered, April 4th is the Jewish Passover and Sunday the 5th is Easter!   So april 2, 3, 4, and 5 are a real cluster! Now that year is mid point of the   7 years if the dates are correct and I counted properly. . .
