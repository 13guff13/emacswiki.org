It's nice to have the chance to use a different search; I've been trying DDG for the past month or so. Usually it gets me what I need; sometimes I go back to google. :::sigh:::

June 29, 2012      This  works well for lighting close-up shots. It&#8217;s not rellay bright enough for portraits, but I don&#8217;t like ring-light portraits anyway. Comes with a ton of different size rings to fit practically any lens ever made, within reason. I have only used the  constant on&#8217; setting. It&#8217;s nice to actually see what is going to be recorded and I can&#8217;t think of any reason to put it on flash, other than maybe to save money on batteries. Some close-ups require that the light actually be pressed flat against the subject or surface. The inner diameter has a clear space so that the light will still shine on the subject. It does work better if you can get a couple inches away, though.The cord on the light is long enough that I can use a long zoom lens with all 3  and the  and there is still plenty of room.I haven&#8217;t taken my white balance off of Auto and the color has been good. I would think it is closest to daylight or flash.I haven&#8217;t taken the light off my camera since I&#8217;ve had it (about a week now). I&#8217;ve been going around shooting everything in macro. I also just bought a . Not overly impressed with it yet, but it just arrived today. I mostly use the . With all 3 tubes used together, it is pretty amazing.I feel that the light is an excellent value   so much cheaper than a strobe ring flash   and it does a good job. It lights the macro subjects well, is very inexpensive, it&#8217;s good quality and design, and it even looks cool mounted on the camera.
