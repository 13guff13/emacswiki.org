I use Emacs since 2009.08.  I use Emacs to read and write c/asm/elisp code. so I write some package for this purpose. 

My email: jianlizhao1@gmail.com. 

Bellow zjl-hl.el and region-list-edit.el are updated in 2016.4.12 and have lot improvement on
1. C++/JAVA highlight
2. The recognize rate of the local var is much much higher and thus is highlighted properly. This is mostly by copying the function body to a temp buffer and do code clean so it semantic can recognize the local var with much higher rate.
3. Improved stability (use this version for half year by myself)

But I disable the highlight once a buffer is changed, otherwise new added the parenthesis might not be paired and cause zjl-hl/semantic dead emacs.


* 1 http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/zjl-hl.el

This highlight C/C++JAVA file local variable/parameters, function call and some other to make code easier to read

To install: 

***  download 
****** zjl-hl.el, 

****** region-list-edit.el(bellow)

****** highlight.el on this emacswiki


***  add below into .emacs (load-file can be replaced by require if wish).  

These lines are minimum configuration needed in emacs 24.3
{{{
(semantic-mode 1)
(require 'semantic/bovine/c nil 'noerror)
(load-file "~/.emacs.d/myconfig/site-lisp/highlight.el")
(load-file "~/.emacs.d/myconfig/site-lisp/region-list-edit.el")
(load-file "~/.emacs.d/myconfig/site-lisp/zjl-hl.el")
(zjl-hl-enable-global 'c-mode)
}}}

* 2 http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/region-list-edit.el

This file is used by zjl-hl.el, it can add/delete a region into/from a region list, such as '((4 . 7) (11 . 15) (17 . 17) (20 . 25))
