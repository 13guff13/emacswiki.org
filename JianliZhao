I use Emacs since 2009.08.  I use Emacs to read and write c/asm/elisp code. so I write some package for this purpose. 

And my email is: jianlizhao1@gmail.com.

This package highlight things such as local variable, function call and bracket,  in C and ELISP. I think some people may like it.

This file is used by my zjl-hl.el,  it can add/delete a region into/from a region list, such as '((4 . 7) (11 . 15) (17 . 17) (20 . 25))
