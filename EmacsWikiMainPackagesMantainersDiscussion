Changelog isnt place to discussion, every time someone solicits something this should be discussed if it affect others, this is for those that most contribute with packages trough EmacsWiki specially those that overlap (you can call for someone through changelog to take a look here, preferably all the parts involved and hope they will see it. Almost the same as discussing on changelog but the other part can reason about it if he wants).

Removing the particular discussion quoted initially. That was resolved off-wiki. And I think people probably agree that such discussion generally belongs somewhere other than in a change log entry (e.g. a wiki page or email). Leaving this page itself, as a guideline and room for discussion of it. -- DrewAdams
