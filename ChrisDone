My name is Chris Done and I use Emacs for editing HTML, XSL/XML, Emacs Lisp, Haskell, C#, JavaScript, CSS, VBScript and configuration files. I also use it for writing documents with org-mode.

What font is that you're using in the [LinumGap line numbers screenshot]?

It's just Deja Vu Sans Mono, the standard Gnome-terminal font on ubuntu.
