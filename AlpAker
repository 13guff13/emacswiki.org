I recently decided to clean up and distribute some packages I've written in the years since I started using Emacs.  

* [[PerWin]].  Per-win-mode changes how Emacs selects point when displaying a buffer in a window.  While it is enabled, each window keeps a record of the last value of point in every buffer that has been displayed in it.  When a window is switched back to a buffer it has displayed before, point and window-start are set to the values they had when that buffer was last displayed in the window.  

* [[FillColumnRule]].  A minor mode that indicates the location of the fill column with a thin line running down the editing window.

* more to come
