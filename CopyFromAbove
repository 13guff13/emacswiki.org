One way to duplicate a line in Emacs is with KillingAndYanking.

  C-p C-k C-n C-y

Go to the previous line, kill it, then go back to the next line and
yank it.

There is a `copy-from-above-command' in ##misc.el## which copies
''ARG'' characters from the line above. If used without a prefix, it
copies the entire string.

To use it, add the following `autoload' to your InitFile.

  (autoload 'copy-from-above-command 'misc
    "Copy characters from previous nonblank line, starting just above point.
  
  \(fn &optional arg)"
    'interactive)

Then, `M-1 M-x copy-from-above-command' will copy 1 character from above.

For demonstration purposes, the command will be bound to the
ArrowKeys.

The up arrow key will copy the rest of the line forward -- the default
behavior.

  (global-set-key [up] 'copy-from-above-command)

The down arrow will copy the current key on to a newly opened line.

  (global-set-key [down] (lambda ()
                           (interactive)
                           (forward-line 1)
                           (open-line 1)
                           (copy-from-above-command)))

The right arrow will copy one character from above.

  (global-set-key [right] (lambda ()
                            (interactive)
                            (copy-from-above-command 1)))

And the left arrow will copy characters from above, backwards!!

  (global-set-key [left] (lambda ()
                           (interactive)
                            (copy-from-above-command -1)
                            (forward-char -1)
                            (delete-char -1)))

Assume the following two lines with point at !.

  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
  01234!

Hitting <right> copies one character

  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
  01234f!

Hitting <left> twice copies characters backwards

  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
  0123!ef

Hitting `C-e' moves point back to the end of the line

  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
  0123ef!

Hitting <up> copies the rest of the line

  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
  0123efghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz!

Hitting <down> copies the whole line

  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
  0123efghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz!
  0123efghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
