This page doesn't get a lot of turn-over; I don't know if that's from a low-volume of questions, or a low-volume of answer(er)s, both, or something else.

I do know that I didn't even notice this page until today (I've been a casual user of this wiki for at least 5 years, and am getting more intensive. Which is possibly why I finally saw it).

Would it make sense to point people at StackOverflow, say to something like http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/emacs

G-d help me all, that's non-free software, isn't it. I'm going to GNU-hell.

Of course, I'm typing this on Windows.....

So. The IS a talk page of sorts, at OpenQuestionsDiscussion.
