http://github.com/emacsmirror is a GIT repository mirror of Emacs code.

This page of the mirror contains nearly all of the code posted on EmacsWiki, though not necessarily up-to-date: '''http://github.com/emacsmirror/emacswiki.org'''.

That page can take a while to load.  There are also individual mirror pages for many of the packages and individual libraries hosted on EmacsWiki (ElispArea).  Look for them on the main mirror page (http://github.com/emacsmirror).
