This is a mode for recording your the screencasts made with ScreencastMode.

The screencast is saved as a ogv-file in the home-directory of the user by default.

* Download: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/screencast-record.el

You can try it out by loading the file and evaluating the following:


 (screencast-record
  '("This is the test of the screencast-record" n
    "You can check the result in ~/screencast-record-test.ogv")
  "screencast-record-test")


Screencasts made for this mode can be seen at ScreencastRecordings.
