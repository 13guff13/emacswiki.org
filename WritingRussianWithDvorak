As you know, all the cyrillic InputMethods work in a way that assumes your 
keyboard is in QWERTY layout. However, if you're using dvorak keyboard layout, 
you may discover that, for example, cyrillic-jcuken input method can't work
properly since all the ascii symbols on your keyboard are mapped to appropriate
cyrillic ones according to the qwerty->jcuken translation rules.

Thus, one of the possible solutions is to define your own input method which
translate symbols according to dvorak->jcuken rules.
Now all that your need is to Download:cyrillic-dvorak.el and put the following 
lines into your ~/.emacs file:

<pre>
(load-file "~/.emacs.d/cyrillic-dvorak.el")
(setq default-input-method "cyrillic-dvorak")
</pre>
