awk-it is now broken for me.
Error: "unknown symbol kbd" or maybe "no symbol value kbd" or something like that, don't remember.

Simple fix:

{{{
(defmacro awk-it-macro-expand-value (macro &rest list)
  "Expands MACRO with values of variables in LIST."
  `(,(symbol-function macro) ,@(mapcar 'symbol-value list)))
}}}

Really want it to be fixed. :)

The documentation doesn't specify how to exit the function.

When runing "M-x awk-t" after I set a mark, I got an error "Symbol's value as variable is void: kbd".
I tried to debug the script step by step from "(defun awk-it-full ...)", however this time the above error was gone
and the expect awk-it message was shown.
Any idea on this? Is it possible a problem related to timing since when debugging the execution is slow enough.
I am using GNU Emacs 24.4.1 on Cygwin, Window 7 Service Pack 1, Intel i5-3380M CPU.
