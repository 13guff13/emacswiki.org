awk-it is now broken for me.
Error: "unknown symbol kbd" or maybe "no symbol value kbd" or something like that, don't remember.

Simple fix:

{{{
(defmacro awk-it-macro-expand-value (macro &rest list)
  "Expands MACRO with values of variables in LIST."
  `(,(symbol-function macro) ,@(mapcar 'symbol-value list)))
}}}

Really want it to be fixed. :)
