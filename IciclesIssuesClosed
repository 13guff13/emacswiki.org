Dear Drew,

I noticed a weird behavior of my Icy completion in e-lisp mode. When I invoke (lisp-complete-symbol), the prompt jumps to minibuffer and nothing happens. So I need to press additional TAB even if there is a sole completion.

In short, can I have the default completion behavior:
* first invocation of lisp-complete-symbol (`M-TAB') completes the symbol *in place* to a common root.
* second invocation jumps to minibufer and *completions* are automatically shown ( if I pressed `M-tab' twice I already want to see all available candidates and additional `TAB' is somewhat time consuming and disturbing).

Thanks. -- SpinuVit

[new:DrewAdams:2009-09-09 17:48 UTC]
I'm not sure what you mean. If I hit `M-TAB' with the cursor after the text `forward-para', then I see this in the minibuffer:

 Complete Lisp symbol: forward-para

If I then hit `TAB' (or `RET') once, the text in the buffer is completed to `forward-paragraph', since that is the sole completion. IOW, what you describe as wanting is pretty much what I see in this regard.

However, completion takes place in the minibuffer, so, as you say, completing to a common prefix among several completions is not done in the buffer -- you see it in the minibuffer instead.

I don't see a bug here, unless I'm missing something. But the '''Icicles''' behavior is different from the vanilla behavior. If you prefer the vanilla behavior, these are your options:

* quit ''Icicle'' mode, at least temporarily
* customize `icicle-redefine-standard-commands-flag' to `nil'

In the latter case, however, you will lose '''Icicles''' completion also for other things -- see the definition of function `icicle-redefine-standard-commands' for the list.

HTH -- DrewAdams

My post was deleted :(  Accidentally probably.

There is clear inconsistency between `icicle-comint-dynamic-complete` and `icicle-lisp-complete-symbol`. 
The latest jumps directly to minibufer even if there is a sole completion or common root. Say I have icy-mod in my buffer, then `icicle-lisp-complete-symbol' will just jump to minibuf for one single letter!! 

My second part of the question was about popping \*completion\* buffer immediately after entering the minibuf (i.e. after second M-Tab). That for obviuous reasons - once one pressed M-TAB twice he defenitelly wants to see available completions.

I really hope the point above could be sorted out. Iciles offers an unique feature for completion and it would be a pity if these minor inconsistencies spoiled the story.

Many thanks. -- SpinuVit


[new:DrewAdams:2009-09-10 16:45 UTC]
1. No, your post was simply moved here, as the log said -- check RecentChanges to see changes.

2. Yes, `icicle-comint-dynamic-complete' and `icicle-lisp-complete-symbol' act differently.

3. Yes, if you hit `M-TAB' after `icy-mod', completion is done in the minibuffer. Just hist `TAB' or `RET' to complete to `icy-mode'. 

4. There is no pressing of `M-TAB' twice. That simply doesn't exist. In vanilla Emacs, repeating `M-TAB' scrolls `*Completions*'. In '''Icicles''' it does not -- use `C-v' or `M-v' to scroll `*Completions*'.

5. If you are asking why `M-TAB' doesn't show `*Completions*' initially, the answer is that that was the design choice. If you want to always show `*Completions*' initially, customize option `icicle-show-Completions-initially-flag'. You might also consider using <tt>[[icomplete+.el]]</tt>, to see the possible prefix completions in the minibuffer.

6. As I said, you can return to the vanilla Lisp-symbol completion, if you prefer that, by simply customizing ‘icicle-redefine-standard-commands-flag’ to ‘nil’.

HTH -- DrewAdams



[new:] 
(#4) In vanilla Emacs, first M-Tab completes the symbol in place, second (if any) opens the `*Completion*' buffer. 

In Icy-mode first M-Tab jumps to minibufer (without completing to common match). Next, `TAB' or `RET' will complete to common match, next RET (TAB) will place the candidate in original buffer,( will open the `*Completions*' and only next `TAB` will start cycling).

So Icicles adds 2-3 additional key strokes even in a trivial case when there is obvious one completion candidate.

wouldn't it be nicer if when there is only one completion candidate or common root just to insert it in place (as vanilla Emacs does), then next `M-TAB' will jump to minibuf and activate `*Completions*'? Looks like a reasonable and very efficient behavior to me.

(#5) Thanks for the tip of <tt>[[icomplete+.el]]</tt>. Setting `icicle-show-Completions-initially-flag' does not work for me. I remember it worked some time back, and it was rather annoying for M-x, buffer and file completion, so no way can usefully use it. For in-buffer completion, instead, it would be really useful to have a separate configuration flag. Don't you think? 

For in-buffer completion the number of candidates is usually small, and as I already said when you press second M-Tab you probably don't know that to type next and expect to see all available completions.

(#6) This is not an option. I like icicle `*completion*'  and not willing to abandon it because of a couple of additional keys (however annoying they can be). -- SpinuVit


[new:DrewAdams:2009-09-14 14:58 UTC]
(#4) Yes, it would be nicer, but it is not feasible, given the current design. When there are multiple candidates, I just call `completing-read'. There is no way to tell `completing-read' to also complete: it just opens the minibuffer to read with completion. Yes, it could be done, using `try-completion', as I did for `icicle-dabbrev-completion', but I probably won't do it, at least not anytime soon. This is just not my priority, sorry. But I will add it to my maybe-to-do list. As you say, there are typically few candidates, so the use of '''Icicles''' completion here is not that big an advantage -- vanilla `M-TAB' is a reasonable alternative, which you might prefer.

(#5) No, I don't think so. See #4.

(#6) You don't need to abandon '''Icicles''' completion in general, just because you forego it for in-buffer symbol completion. In addition, you might find `##C-M-/##' (`icicle-dabbrev-completion') useful in this context. It generally behaves more like what you want, I think. Its domain of candidates is not the same as `M-TAB', but it often DTRT. -- DrewAdams

[new:DrewAdams:2009-09-10 17:16 UTC]
It works for me. But you need to remap the command that `C-h a' is bound to by default, `apropos-command'. In [[Customize]] , you click `INS' to add an entry, then choose `##Command to remap##' in the `##Value Menu##', then enter ##icicle-apropos## as the command to remap (under `Choice'), enter ##icicle-apropos## as the `Command', and enter ##t## as the value of `Condition'. Then set or save. It works for me. -- DrewAdams

Hi, i'm trying to use icicle-search-buffer to perform a search and
replace on all open buffers. But i just cannot get it to work. Here's
what i'm doing (windows, emacsw32 v23.0.x, icicles from current CVS):

<pre>
1. M-x icicle-search-buffer RET
2. Find (regexp): \(\.\.\\\)*xxx\\yyy RET
3. Subgroup to use as search context [0, 1, 2,...] (default 0): 0 RET
4. Choose buffer (`RET' when done): .* S-Tab <completion window with all buffers selected> M-!
5. Choose buffer (`RET' when done): RET
6. Choose an occurrence: C-S-RET
7. Replace with: $(Dir)\xxx\yyy RET
8. 'No match for $(Dir)\xxx\yyy' appears in echo area for a short time) and i'm back at 6.
</pre>

Now, i was trying for quite some time to convince icicles to perform
my replacement until i finally realized, that what doesn't work are
the single '\' in the replacement string (this is emacs 23.0.x on
windows). As soon as i replaced them with '\\' i actually got a
hit. So i finally could continue with:

<pre>
9. Choose an occurrence: M-,
10. Replace with: $(Dir)\\xxx\\yyy RET
11. Choose an occurrence: C-S-RET
12. Choose an occurrence: C-|
</pre>

But it took me more than an hour (ok, feels stupid now) to realize
what's happening. So maybe it would be possible to provide some more
meaningful error message than just the 'No match for ...'?

Also, what is really expected as input in 6. wasn't quite clear to
me. I've been trying a lot of different things here (like using '.*
S-Tab M-!' to select all occurrences, and a couple of other stupid
things). It might be worth adding some example to the documentation?

Ok, then i realized that my replacement did not work and that the
search had to be changed to:

<pre>
2a. Find (regexp): \(\(?:\.\.\\?\)*\)\(\\xxx\\yyy\) RET
</pre>

with a replacement of:

<pre>
10a. Replace with: ..\\..\\..\\\1\\aaa\\bbb\\ccc\2 RET
</pre>

But now, \1 and \2 are somehow not getting replaced with the matches
from the search expression.

E.g. an input of:

<pre>
..\xxx\yyy\zzz
</pre>

would result in:

<pre>
..\..\..\\aaa\bbb\ccc\zzz
</pre>

However, a normal query-replace-regexp with the same
search/replacement expressions and input is giving the expected result
of:

<pre>
..\..\..\..\aaa\bbb\ccc\xxx\yyy\zzz
</pre>

I'm lost - no clue what i'm doing wrong now.

Thanks for any pointers in the right direction! -- [[Kai]]

[new:DrewAdams:2009-05-27 02:26 UTC]
Hi, Kai. Sorry for your trouble.

I have difficulty following your example -- there is too much going on at once here, for one thing. A couple of suggestions:

1. Let's do this by email, since it sounds like there will be a bit of discussion, to be able to understand the situation etc. Send me a mail via `M-x icicle-send-bug-report'. Don't repeat what you've already said. The place to start is with something simpler.

2. We need to break it down into the separate questions. First, I need to know what ''does'' work. Give me an example of what you're doing, but using a very simple regexp -- no backslashes etc. That will make sure we're on the same page wrt the expected sequence of events and whether things basically work or not. Once we've got that down, we can proceed to fancy regexps, fancy replacements, etc.

Give me a recipe with just a few, simple buffer names -- maybe just one -- and a simple regexp (e.g. a literal string) and a simple replacement string -- no `##\,##' constructs etc. Then we'll make it more complex bit by bit.

4. You say that you used `##M-!##'. That won't work for '''Icicles''' search and replace. `##M-!##' applies an action that is designed to act on a list of candidates. What you want is `##C-|##', which is an ''alternative action'' (which is replacement, for Icicles search) and which acts on ''each'' candidate -- not on the ''list'' of candidates. Summary:

* `##C-!##' -- normal action, applied to ''each'' candidate
* `##M-!##' -- normal list action, applied to the ''list of all'' candidates
* `##C-|##' -- ''alternative'' action, applied to each candidate -- for search, this is replacement
* `##M-|##' -- ''alternative list'' action, applied to the list of all candidates

For '''Icicles''' search, no list actions are defined -- no `##M-!##', no  `##M-|##'. For search, the normal action browses search hits, so applying the normal action to ''each'' hit in turn makes no sense -- so no `##C-!##' either (it's not undefined, but it's useless). If you want to perform replacement for all candidates, then you want to apply the alternative action to each candidate: `##C-|##'.

I know there is a lot to get used to. But once you do, it's pretty logical.

We'll eventually get to your fancy replacement, but let's do it a step at a time, making sure both (a) that we're on the same page and (b) that things do in fact work as they should. ;-)

Once we understand each other and we are sure things work as they should, we can discuss how I might make things clearer in the doc. Thanks for your patience. Hopefully, it will be rewarded.

Thx -- DrewAdams

Shift-tab completion is extremely slow for me.  I've byte compiled all the Icicles .el files, but it still takes about 10 seconds just to do a completion for my currently open buffers (about 10 of them).  Any idea why this would be the case?  Thanks.  -- [[Divia]]

Thanks for the reply.  I installed bzr and used bzr branch http://archives.hodique.info/bzr/icicles/ to get the latest version of icicles, but now Shift-Tab completion isn't working at all.

##wrong-type-argument stringp nil## on completion for text entries

I am receiving a ##wrong-type-argument stringp nil## error while trying to complete the fileset entries for the FileSets function.  This does not prevent the completion which does succeed. 

The error is only when a completion attempt (either prefix or apropos) is made for a text entry that is *NOT* a command, function, buffer or a file. For these types, the error does not appear.

The error occurs when I try to invoke <code>`filesets-open'</code> command. The sequence of events is as follows:

# I invoke <code>M-x filesets-open</code>
# The prompt for filesets is displayed in the minibuffer
# I enter the prefix for the fileset to open and press the <code>TAB</code> key
# The error message <code>wrong-type-argument stringp nil</code> is displayed in the mini-buffer
# I can then press <code>TAB</code> or <code>down</code> again to successfully complete the entry

'''Backtrace details''' -- The setup is using:
* Icicles Update # (from icicles.el): ##22437  Version 22.0## 

* Emacs: GNU Emacs 22.3.1 (i386-mingw-nt5.1.2600) of 2008-09-06 on SOFT-MJASON

* OS: Windows XP Pro Service Pack 2

The test was done using <code>emacs -Q</code> and with only Icicles and FileSets enabled (only elisp files, not byte-compiled).
Using <code>(setq debug-on-error t)</code>, the following backtrace is displayed (the name of the fileset being loaded is "testFileSet"):

<pre>

The default buffer of `icicle-buffer' and the buffer selected by `C-x b RET' mismatch.

Such as:
<code>
`C-x C-f TAB C-g', `M-:' (icicle-default-buffer-names), and it echo ("*Completions*" " *Minibuf-1*" "*Completions*" "icicles-mac.el").

`C-x b' , minibuffer will be "+ Switch to buffer (icicles-mac.el): ", input nothing, RET. And "*Completions*" will be selected. This is very strange.

[new:DrewAdams:2009-04-02 17:02 UTC]
I cannot reproduce the problem as you describe it. However, are you sure that your regexp is the right one? Try using a regexp that filters out only `*Completions*', to see if that works for you, at least.

Note that if you use [[Customize]] to set the option value, then do not use double backslashes (`##\##') in the value you type in -- the value should be just ##^\*Completions\*##, not ##^\\*Completions\\*##. After setting the option value using Customize, `C-h v' will show double backslashes. -- DrewAdams

[new]
I'll give you more detail:

(setq icicle-buffer-no-match-regexp "^\\*Completions\\*$") ; I'm sure this regexp is right, it indeed match buffer ##*Completions*##.


`C-x C-f TAB C-g', `M-:' (icicle-default-buffer-names), Minibuffer echo ("##*Completions##*" "##*Minibuf-1*##" "##*Completions*##" "web-default.ss").

`C-x b', Minibuffer will be "+ Switch to buffer ( ##*Minibuf-1*##): " , just RET, ##*Completions*## will be select. error happen. I input nothing and default buffer is ##*Minibuf-1*##, RET, ##*Minibuf-1*## should be selected.


Now set icicle-buffer-no-match-regexp to nil, repeat above steps.


`C-x C-f TAB C-g', `M-:' (icicle-default-buffer-names), Minibuffer echo ("##*Completions##*" "##*Minibuf-1*##" "##*Completions*##" "web-default.ss").

`C-x b', Minibuffer will be "+ Switch to buffer ( ##*Completions*##): " , just RET, ##*Completions*## will be select. It's normal case.

I found the problem is caused by function `icicle-read-shell-command', it will add current-directory to the front of the initial input. -- [[deftsp]]



[new:DrewAdams:2009-03-26 21:09 UTC]
This is a feature, not a bug. Just hit `RET' -- the directory is ignored. 

As soon as you complete to a command (which is what you are doing here), the directory is removed from the minibuffer. See:
* [[Icicles - Shell-Command Enhancements]]
* [[Icicles - Dired Enhancements#CompleteShellCommands]]

The directory is there because '''Icicles''' lets you use ''file-name'' completion to navigate to any command file, anywhere. In addition to this file-name completion, command completion is available for commands that Emacs thinks might be appropriate (e.g. `find', in the case you described).

The command completion is similar to what vanilla Emacs provides. What '''Icicles''' provides additionally is file-name completion. Known commands as completion candidates are highlighted in `*Completions*' using face `icicle-extra-candidate'. They are provided from three possible sources:

1. Associations provided by [[option]] `dired-guess-shell-alist-user' (and the automatically provided `dired-guess-shell-alist-default' associations), if you use Dired X (standard library ##dired-x.el##).

2. MIME-type associations (starting with Emacs 23).

3. Commands recognized by your search path, if option `icicle-guess-commands-in-path' is non-`nil'.

Candidates from all of these sources are treated the same way:

* Each is highlighted in `*Completions*' with face `icicle-extra-candidate' -- easy to distinguish from a file name.

* If you complete to such a command, the default directory disappears from the minibuffer.

This is spelled out in the doc and doc strings. For example, hit `##C-h k M-!##', then click the link to see the doc string of `icicle-read-shell-command-completing'. -- DrewAdams

[new]
command completion is a cool feature. 

But to the `grep-find', the variable `grep-find-command' default value is ##find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 -e grep -nH -e ##. When I execute `grep-find', Minibuffer will be: ##find (like this) (~/.emacs.d/packages/icicles/find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 -e grep -nH -e ): ~/.emacs.d/packages/icicles/find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 -e grep -nH -e ##. 

Cursor stay at the front of find, because the default `grep-find-command' is good enough, I just `C-e', cursor will go to the end of the line, and input something I need to grep them in all files in current directory. But Shell will treate `~/.emacs.d/packages/icicles/find' as a shell command, error happen. -- [[deftsp]]


[new:DrewAdams:2009-03-27 04:47 UTC]
I see the problem now, and I'll think about a solution (but not before the weekend). Until a solution is available, you can at least turn off '''Icicles''' treatment for reading shell commands (and other things) by customizing option `icicle-redefine-standard-commands-flag’ to ‘nil’. If you do that, then ''Icicle'' mode will not substitute any '''Icicles''' commands for standard commands. -- DrewAdams

Command `icicle-buffer'  use ##(another-buffer nil t)## or ##(other-buffer (current-buffer))## as default prompt. 
When last buffer is `*Completions*', `C-x b RET' will select buffer `*Completions*'. Most of

[new:DrewAdams:2009-03-26 21:09 UTC]
I fixed the latter part: `icicle-buffer-no-match-regexp' now affects the default choice. Please try the latest <tt>[[icicles-cmd.el]]</tt>.

However, I'm not convinced that `*Completions*' should be singled out for special treatment here. '''Icicles''' behaves the same as vanilla Emacs in this regard: If `*Completions*' is the last buffer you accessed, then it will be the default choice.

It's very unusual, BTW, if `*Completions*' is the last buffer you access. Can you provide a specific recipe for how that happens to you? -- DrewAdams

[new]
For example, I use `C-x C-f' to find a file and press `TAB', buffer `*Completions*' is created then I press `C-g'. The result is that buffer `*Completions*' is the last buffer I access.

I agree `*Completions*' should not be singled out for special treatment here. But if someone do not like '*Completions*' to be selected, icicle can satisfy her too like your fix.

I notice a problem, the define of function `icicle-default-buffer-name' in <tt>[[icicles-cmd.el]]</tt>. The last argument of `memq' is a LIST, but `icicle-buffer-no-match-regexp' is not.
{{{

Oops; how silly. Sorry about that. Please try it again with the latest versions of <tt>[[icicles-cmd.el]]</tt> and <tt>[[icicles-fn.el]]</tt>.

Actually, it never occurred to me before to filter the default value(s) using the '''Icicles''' global filters ([[Icicles - Global Filters]]), but I guess it's a good idea. I've added that generally now, for `completing-read' and `read-file-name', not just for buffer names.

BTW, I never see `*Completions*' as the default after `C-x C-f TAB C-g C-x b'. I guess because I use a separate frame for `*Completions*'. I had to start with ##emacs -Q## to reproduce that. -- DrewAdams

[new]
I add ##^\\*Completions\\*## to icicle-buffer-no-match-regexp. After `C-x C-f TAB C-g C-x b', the mibibuffer is ##+ Switch to buffer: ## , no default buffer. How about use the buffer before `*Completions*' as default buffer. I guess it can be get from buffer history.

Thanks for your fix. -- [[deftsp]]

[new:DrewAdams:2009-03-27 23:19 UTC]
The short answer: No, you'll have to get it from the history (`M-p').

This is not a buffer thing; it's general. The minibuffer now respects '''Icicles''' global filtering for the default value(s), as well for completion candidates. At this level (`read-from-minibuffer'), there is no notion of "the buffer before `*Completions*' or even of buffers.

However, if you use Emacs 23, then there can be multiple default values. Vanilla Emacs appends ''all'' buffers to the list of default values (which are available via `M-n') -- which is silly, IMO. '''Icicles''' keeps just the first four. So with '''Icicles''' and Emacs 23, you will likely get a default value even after filtering. To see this, you will need the latest files. -- DrewAdams

Oh, It works. Thanks for all your done. -- [[deftsp]]

With „<em>GNU Emacs 23.0.60.13 (i686-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 2.12.11) of 2008-12-31</em>“ and Icicles from right now, I have a problem with [[Icicles - Programming with Fancy Candidates]]: I eval <code>(completing-read "Package: " '("one" "two" "three")  nil t nil)</code>, type <code>one RET</code>, and I got <code>#("one" 0 3 (face nil))</code>. I expected just <code>"one"</code> since no one of the 3 conditions for the activation of fancy candidates was met. 
While debugging, I found that <code>icicle-fancy-cands-internal-p</code> is set to nil; however, <code>icicle-unpropertize-completion-result-flag</code> is still nil.

This causes problems with [[SlimeMode]] from CVS: pressing <code>,</code> to activate the minibuffer command, then <code>!p RET</code>, then selecting a package will fail (function: <code>slime-repl-set-package</code>). Maybe Slime should unpropertize this text, but since <code>(face nil)</code> is anyway useless, Icicles could also not add it. --[[DanielClemente]]

I'm having problems with `icicle-read-shell-command' with `default-value' being nil in two cases. With compile in any buffer and with shell-command on non-file buffers.

But the result is bad: the prompt appears like ##. Compile Command (): ## with those ugly empty parens.

Perhaps due to changes in minibuffer completion for new files ([http://www.nabble.com/C-x-C-b-and-C-x-C-f-bugging-about-confirmation-td20621100.html]), Icicles is not allowing me to open new files. Using Emacs 23 from today (21-12-2008) and Icicles from today (icicles.el #22312), and this .emacs:

    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/icicles/") (require 'icicles) (icy-mode 1)

Do this:
* C-x C-f
* Type a file name which doesn't exist, for instance test142857
* Press ENTER

Then „<strong>No prefix completions</strong>“ appears (even if you press ENTER more times) and you cannot open that new file. ENTER works, however, in C-x C-w for an unexisting name. M-x unexisting ENTER does nothing.

Debugging it, I saw that no (cond) in (icicle-minibuffer-complete-and-exit) was true until the last (t (icicle-display-candidates-in-Completions)), which ran. -- 21-dec-2008, [[DanielClemente]].

Hello, here is a small patch to automatically trigger an action when the explorer has only one match. This is pretty handy when using icicle-find-tag to jump to tags at point. I guess there is a bug in defun icicle-first-matching-candidate since it returned the value from string-match which is then used in  icicle-get-alist-candidate as if it were an element of the candidates list. Not sure though it's from my first journey with edebug :)

Those are two independent patches: a bug fix and a suggestion. Both are good. Thx. I applied both, but I implemented the completion bypass suggestion a bit differently. (Things are more complex, because of the possibility of multi-completions etc.)

I am using ''GNU Emacs 23.0.0.1 (i386-mingw-nt5.1.2600) of 2007-06-20 on TPAD''. Well, actually I suspect this might not be a bug and might be an inevitable delay for other some improved feature. In that case, I should consider upgrading my old Tualatin Celeron :-(. -- ThomasLim


[new:DrewAdams:2008-09-22 14:57 UTC]
Thanks for your report, Thomas, and for the effort of trying to track this down. I suspect that the slowdown comes from the code that highlights non-matching input. Please take a look at [[Icicles - Icompletion#HighlightNonmatch]]. Try setting some of the options described there. 

As a first test try setting `icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure' to `nil'. If you do not see an improvement with that, then the non-match highlighting is not the problem. Let me know if this highlighting is indeed the problem, and whether you have found a reasonable solution by customizing the options.

I think this highlighting is a very useful feature, but it can be costly. Essentially, it retests your input for each char you type or delete. And when it checks your input it checks multiple subsets (prefixes) of your input, to determine the place where the non-match begins. At least it does the latter using a binary search, but the whole operation is still costly.

Note the special mention about remote files. Testing remote file-name input is '''''really''''' a killer, because each attempt to see if part of your input matches entails a remote machine access. I've done what I could to provide option values to work around this, but the potential problem is always there. Using the toggle `##C-^##' to temporarily turn off remote-file checking can help here.

I suspect that the default value of `icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure' is bad for you, and that customizing that option will give you good performance. Let me know. Sometimes I think I will change the default value, but I haven't yet. Perhaps you have a suggestion about the default? I prefer not to turn this feature off, because some users tend not to learn about options unless they run into a problem. ;-) I tell myself it's better to at least let people see this feature up front, and then they will learn that they can modify or remove it, if they have performance problems. -- DrewAdams

[new]
Thank you for your answer. Setting `icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure' to `nil' seems to decrease the delay a little bit but not that much (only 10~20% as far as I feel). I entered C-x C-f (`icicle-file') and long-pressed any alphabet key for some seconds. -- ThomasLim

[new:DrewAdams:2008-09-24 02:44 UTC]
Then I'm afraid I don't know what to suggest, without more info. If you could use the debugger to find out where the time is being spent, then I could perhaps act accordingly. I'd like to help, but I will need more info. 

Can you characterize when it happens? Does it matter whether minibuffer input is read with or without completion? (E.g. try ##(read-from-minibuffer "Some prompt: ")##, which does not use completion.) Does it matter whether it is file-name completion or some other completion (e.g. `C-x C-f' versus `C-x b')? 

If the problem occurs only for `M-x' (command completion), then try customizing `icicle-top-level-key-bindings' to remove the mapping of `execute-extended-command' to `icicle-execute-extended-command'.

From your description, the problem should go away if you use `##C-###' to turn off (toggle) incremental completion. Does it? Every bit of info helps, but turning off incremental completion doesn't fix the problem, of course. ;-)

Please let me know whatever you can find out -- the more the better. Thanks -- DrewAdams

[new:DrewAdams:2008-09-24 16:44 UTC]
Also, and perhaps most importantly, can you please test with a different Emacs version, preferably Emacs 22? You are using Emacs 23, and a very old version of that. Emacs 23 is not stable, and it is difficult to debug '''Icicles''' against a moving target. And it is likely that I cannot reproduce what you see on an intermediate development version from 2007.

The detail of the callstack changes for each trial but the topmost entry is always ##"NET USE:"## thing. I recall what you had mentioned regarding remote files before. But there is, as far as I know, no remote file involved here: the emacs binaries, all the `*.el' files and the working directory are in my local disk. To answer your other requests, `C-#' during `C-x C-f' seems to decrease the delay a little bit but not that much. Weird thing about `C-#' is that the callstack does not show up when I quit during the delay even if ##debug-on-quit## is set as ##t##.

`C-x b' nor ##(read-from-minibuffer "Some prompt: ")## do not have delay. I need more time to inspect if `M-x' also became slower. I regert that I should have been more specific in my earlier report :-) Thanx. -- ThomasLim


[new:DrewAdams:2008-09-27 15:11 UTC]
Thanks for the update. Could you please try with a regular Emacs release. AFAIK, Emacs 22.1.50.1 is not Emacs 22; it is a very old development version of Emacs 23 (the "50" indicates that). Please try with the normal Emacs release 22.1 or 22.2, for instance. 

I can also tell (from the prompt, which still uses "##(<S-tab>, TAB: list, C-?: help")##, that you are using a very old version of '''Icicles'''. Please use the latest version -- that is the only version that I debug and fix.

So far, it seems from what you say that the delay occurs only for file-name completion, which confirms what I was saying about non-match highlighting, incremental completion, and remote file testing. But you say that turning off incremental completion (`##C-###') makes no difference, which surprises me. I don't understand how you can see a slowdown when `##C-###' is toggled off.

Oops, maybe I do see. Please try the latest <tt>[[icicles-fn.el]]</tt>. I just fixed a bug while checking the code: I had a typo that prevented `##C-###' from turning off non-match highlighting when `icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure' has its default value of `implicit'. The code was testing for a (non-existent) value of `implicit-remote', not `implicit' as it should. With the fix, toggling incremental completion off should turn off input mismatch highlighting.

Another thing you can try is setting `icicle-test-for-remote-files-flag' to `nil' -- that tells '''Icicles''' that all the files you are using are local, so there is no need to check for remote file-name syntax. See if that makes a difference. However, that should be turned off anyway if you toggle `##C-###' off. 

The system call to ##NET USE## is normal, if you are on MS Windows. Are you saying that that is causing a significant delay? That would be interesting to know. It should be quick; its purpose is to check whether a given drive is a network drive or local. The aim is to avoid accessing a network drive (mapped drive) because such (quasi-)remote access can take time.

I don't know what else to tell you at this point. The main thing is to test with up-to-date '''Icicles''' files and a real Emacs release. It's impossible to tell anything with an Emacs 23 development version. And they are changing things as we speak wrt reading file names in Emacs 23 because of performance problems. For purposes of testing '''Icicles''', just avoid Emacs 23 until it is released.  -- DrewAdams

[new]
I've tried ''GNU Emacs 22.3.1 (i386-mingw-nt5.1.2600) of 2008-09-07 on SOFT-MJASON'' (This must be regular release and new, right?) which shows the same delay. And with up-to-date icicles, `##C-###' removes the delay. And setting `icicle-test-for-remote-files-flag' to `nil' also removes the delay! (Before updating, I was using old icicles that are from 2008-2-1 CVS that showed this kind of delay for the first time as I mentioned before.)

I think ##NET USE## must be responsible for the delay because when I randomly abort during the delay, I always see ##NET USE## at the top of the callstack. ##NET USE## seems to be called at every character insert/delete. Isn't it sufficient to run ##NET USE## only when the first 1 or 2 characters, that determines the drive, has changed? Or how about calling it once and reusing the first test result next time? -- ThomasLim

[new:DrewAdams:2008-09-28 16:26 UTC]
OK, good; now we're back to square 1 ;-). Just to be sure you understand: `##C-###' or `nil' `icicle-test-for-remote-files-flag' just side-steps the issue. `##C-###' prevents incremental completion altogether, which you probably do not want to do most of the time. `icicle-test-for-remote-files-flag' prevents use of remote files and tells '''Icicles''' that you are using only local files, so, again, you probably do not want to do that most of the time.

Coming back to the beginning, the proper thing to adjust for this is option '''`icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure'''' (and perhaps its brothers,  `icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure-delay' and `icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure-threshold'). Please try customizing this (without saving your customizations). 

Try first choosing item '''Never''' (= Lisp value `nil') in the Customize '''Value Menu'''. That should do the same thing as what you saw for `##C-###' and for `nil' `icicle-test-for-remote-files-flag', but without preventing incremental completion.

Then try each of the other values in the menu, in order -- the order is from least permissive to most. For example, choosing item '''Explicit (`TAB'/`S-TAB') strict completion''' (= Lisp value `explicit-strict') will highlight input non-matches only when you hit `TAB' or `S-TAB', and only when completion is strict (which excludes file-name completion, which is lax). One of these values should give you behavior you like.

I believe that there is a problem with ##NET USE## on your machine. I'm no expert on this area, but you might want to test a bit with or without Emacs (and '''Icicles'''). A call to ##NET USE## should be very quick. It involves no access of mapped drives; it simply checks in a local value whether a given drive is mapped to a network drive or is local. I believe something is wrong in your case.

I'm afraid that your suggested improvements would be inappropriate, because minibuffer input can be virtually anything. It would not be easy to reliably determine what is reference to a Windows drive and what is not (it need not be the input prefix). And the whole idea of incremental completion is that the completion candidates are updated on the fly when you change, yes, a single character anywhere in the input.

I am open to suggestions, but I believe so far that the code does about the best that can be done. The right approach, I think, is for users to be aware of the possibilities and adapt them to their own use cases. This is why there are several options and several option values. And this is why there are convenient toggle keys for incremental completion and testing for remote files (`##C-###' and `##C-^##', respectively). The user is the best one to master this, IMO -- the code should not try to be too smart.

But, as I say, I'm open to concrete and informed suggestions -- I just ask that the existing design be understood and tried first. And I am especially open to (1) changing the default value of `icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure' (perhaps to `explicit-strict'?) and (2) improving the doc. Suggestions welcome.

I've kept the default value as `implicit' because (1) I think that it should work well for most people and (2) it lets new users see that such highlighting is possible. 

If I change the default value to, say, `explicit', then many users will not know that the same feature is available for incremental completion. Similarly, if I change it to, say, `implicit-strict', many users will not know that the highlighting is also available for lax (e.g. file-name) completion. Many (most?) users don't read the doc well (or at all), so default values are very important. On the other hand, if there are a significant number of users for whom a value such as `implicit' causes a long delay, then that is even worse, because many of them will not know that (or how) they can change this.

As I say, suggestions welcome. And if you do get to investigate further why ##NET USE## causes a delay for you, please let me know. Thanks for your help. -- DrewAdams

[new]
First of all, setting '''`icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure'''' to `nil' does not remove the delay at all. In my case, every ##NET USE D:## call takes up to 400ms which is very expensive for entering just one character. (Is it only me who experience this problem?) When you delete 10 characters, at least 10 ##NET USE D:## processes are invoked. The result of ##NET USE D:## will not change nor need to be checked so frequently. I think the results of ##NET USE C:##, ##NET USE D:##... can be saved in a hash table and can be used later without invoking another ##NET USE## process, so called memoizing approach, as shown below:

<pre>
(defvar remote-drive-hash (make-hash-table :test 'equal))

(defun check-remote-drive (drv)
  (let ((lookup (gethash drv remote-drive-hash 'no-assoc)))
    (if (equal lookup 'no-assoc)
	(puthash drv 
		 (call-process shell-file-name nil nil nil shell-command-switch
			       (concat "NET USE " drv)) remote-drive-hash)
      lookup)))

(defun icicle-file-remote-p (file)
  "Non-nil means FILE is likely to name a file on a remote system.
For MS Windows, this includes a file on a mapped network drive.
Otherwise, this uses `ffap-file-remote-p' and `file-remote-p' (if
defined)."
  ;; $$$$  (save-match-data        ; $$$$$ IS THIS NEEDED?
  (if (and (eq system-type 'windows-nt)
           (let ((case-fold-search  t)) (string-match "\\`\\([a-z]:\\)" file)))
      (eq 0 (condition-case nil
                (check-remote-drive
		 (match-string 1 file))
              (error nil)))
    (or (and (fboundp 'ffap-file-remote-p) (ffap-file-remote-p file))
        (and (fboundp 'file-remote-p) (file-remote-p file)))))
</pre>

You worry about the minibuffer input can be virtually anything but this delay problem seems to be restricted to '''`icicle-read-file-name''''. -- ThomasLim


[new:DrewAdams:2008-09-30 17:48 UTC]
You are absolutely right on all accounts. I've incorporated your fix, assuming that's all right with you. I also made another improvement to avoid a redundant call to `icicle-file-remote-p' when `icicle-highlight-input-noncompletion' has already called `icicle-file-remote-p' and determined that the file is local. Thx for the feedback and fix.

I also changed the default value of `icicle-highlight-input-noncompletion' to `implicit-strict', so file-name input is no longer highlighted by default.  I hate to do this, because I think this feature is ''especially'' useful for file names, but it's not worth scaring people away who might see poor performance and never find out about customizing the option.

Please try the latest files and let me know. 

BTW, by "virtually anything", I meant that minibuffer ''file-name'' input can have text prefixing a drive letter, so it would be difficult to parse it reliably. I was thinking of stuff preceding `##/##' or `##~##', but I was mistaken that that is a problem here. And anyway the code already relies on matching the drive letter as the prefix.

Let me know if you do find out why ##NET USE## is slow for you -- I'm curious. It's instantaneous for me, and I have both local drives and mapped network drives.

Thanks for all the work on icicles.  I used it fairly often at my previous job and am setting it up for better use in my current job.  I can't perform the last bullet point on page [[Icicles - Large Candidate Sets]] about not displaying a large candidate set after computing it.  When I do `C-u icicle-locate-file' it asks for a directory.  Now if I do `C-M-Tab' it does compute a set without displaying it but it does not recurse subdirectories.  How do I get it to recurse? -- [[Kartik]]

[new:DrewAdams:2008-08-03 06:29 UTC]
Hi Kartik. It should work, but perhaps you are expecting something different from what the explanation tries to say. I just checked, and it works for me at least, on MS Windows.

This is what should happen: `##C-u M-x icicle-locate-file##' asks for the base directory, which you provide. From then on, you are completing against absolute file names (i.e. including directories) that have the base directory as a prefix. For example, if the base directory is ##/foo/bar##, then the completion candidates would include things like this (assuming they exist):

 /foo/bar/
 /foo/bar/fifi.el
 /foo/bar/titi/
 /foo/bar/titi/tata.el
 /foo/bar/titi/tutu.el
 /foo/bar/toto.el

If you then hit `TAB' or `S-TAB', you will see these candidates in `*Completions*'. You can type more prefix text, say ##/foo/bar/ti##, and hit `TAB' again to see that completed to ##/foo/bar/titi/##. Or you can use a regexp with `S-TAB': e.g. ##/foo/bar/ti../ta## will complete to ##/foo/bar/titi/tata.el##.

If you use `C-M-TAB' or `C-M-S-TAB' instead of `TAB' or `S-TAB', the result should be exactly the same, except that the candidates are not displayed in `*Completions*'. It might be a bit harder to follow, since you do not see the set that you are completing against, but the result should be exactly the same. Try it first using `TAB' and `S-TAB', to see if that at least does what you expect.

If you do find that you get different completion results for the `C-M-' keys, then please post a recipe to reproduce the problem in detail (file names, keys you hit, etc., leaving nothing out). Perhaps there is a bug, but I don't see it yet. I suspect that if there is a bug, you will also see the same problem for `TAB' and `S-TAB', so start with those.

FWIW, I don't use the `C-M-' completion keys much, myself. I like to see the candidates in `*Completions*'. I mention this feature because it can save a little display time. However, if time is really of the essence, more time can be saved by creating persistent sets of file names that target the files you want. 

That is, you can have several saved completion sets, each of which represents a given set of files (absolute locations) -- part of a project, say. Then, instead of completing against all the files on your hard disk, you would complete against the right project or project part. IOW, [[Icicles - Persistent Completions]] is your friend. Persistent sets not only offer convenience -- retrieve a set at any time by name, without re-specifying each time how it is defined, but they also save time: the set of names is just retrieved instead of calculated.

I do sometimes use my entire file system as a set of completion candidates -- and that is one of my persistently saved candidate sets. But when I can, I use a narrower target. Usually, I have some idea where a file is located, and that knowledge can save time over a brute-force search. 

Note, BTW, that you can now locate a file using its modification date, in addition to matching its name and location: [[Icicles - File-Name Input#LocateByDate|Icicles - Locate Files by Date]]. Note too that you can define a set that includes specific files or directories located anywhere, by building it up in pieces -- see [[Icicles - Candidate Sets]]. Take the time to build a set once, then reuse it quickly many times. Thx -- DrewAdams

[new:DrewAdams:2008-08-03 07:03 UTC]
BTW, I just edited [[get-icicles.sh]], because I think it had some incorrect directories. But I'm no shell script guru. Perhaps you could sanity-check my change? Thx -- DrewAdams

Icicles binds f5.  However, f5 is reserved for user bindings, not library bindings (see emacs info pages on keybindings for details).   Furthermore, it's difficult to customize this away - you have to customize a whole keybinding block.  I'd recommend binding to non-function keys instead.   [[AndrewHyatt]]

[new:DrewAdams:2008-08-06 17:26 UTC]
Good catch. Should be fixed now. And I improved `icicle-kmacro'.

I don't understand your comment about customization difficulty, however. It is trivial to change a single key binding. -- DrewAdams

Icicle-mode does not work correctly with emacs 23.0.60.3.  When using tab-completion on a path, the entire path prefix disappears.  Here's details:

# Load up emacs -q, load up icicles
# Assuming directory ~/foo/bar
# C-x C-f ~/foo/b <TAB>
# At this point ~/foo disappears leaving just b, which emacs then interprets as relative to the current directory.

emacs 23 has some changes to minibuffer completion, so I imagine there is a conflict. -- AndrewHyatt

I cannot reproduce that with the CVS build I have:
GNU Emacs 23.0.60.1 (i386-mingw-nt5.1.2600)
 of 2008-05-04 on LENNART-69DE564

Please always specify your Emacs version and platform (e.g. use Help > About Emacs), and make sure you are using the latest '''Icicles''' files. I have no access to a build later than 2008-05-04, for the moment. If you want to help, you could try debugging the problem:

# Load the '''Icicles''' source files (not byte-compiled files).
# Load the source file ##minibuffer.el## in the Emacs ##lisp## directory.
# ##M-x debug-on-entry icicle-find-file## (or whatever command you are using)

I'm using icicles 22.0, which seems to be the latest.  My system is linux, ubuntu Dapper distro.  

I traced the problem from `icicle-prefix-complete-1's call to `icicle-clear-minibuffer'.  It appears that clearing the minibuffer no longer completely clears it anymore?  Very strange.  I can trace more if you need to, maybe this is enough to go on. -- AndrewHyatt

[new:DrewAdams:2008-05-29 16:00 UTC]
Please do trace more. Please describe what happens when `icicle-clear-minibuffer' is called, versus what you expected it to do. All it does is call `delete-minibuffer-contents', but perhaps that is no longer sufficient. I see no difference, however, in the definition of `delete-minibuffer-contents' in my build and the latest CVS ##minibuffer.el## -- it just calls `delete-field'. (That is about the ''only'' part of ##minibuffer.el##  that is the same.) I suspect that the problem is not `icicle-clear-minibuffer'.

There are several places things could go wrong in the evaluation of `icicle-prefix-complete'. When you trace, here are some things to look for:

They are apparently changing ##minibuffer.el## (which is a new file for Emacs 23) willy nilly. As I said, I don't try to track the Emacs 23 evolution. But if you can determine where the problem is, I'll try to DTRT. Thx.

[new:DrewAdams:2008-05-30 19:13 UTC]
I just picked up a Windows binary built on 2008-05-29 (thanks, LennartBorgman), and gave it a try. I can't reproduce what you see. However, with IcompleteMode turned on, nothing works! They've changed something that makes insertions in the minibuffer by [[IcompleteMode#IcompleteModePlus|Icomplete Plus]] be considered part of the minibuffer input. 

I'll investigate that a little further, but please try to follow up on your bug report, to see if we can't figure it out. (If you use <tt>[[icomplete+.el]]</tt>, then first turn off `icomplete-mode', to eliminate that interference.) Thx -- DrewAdams

[new:DrewAdams:2008-05-31 08:37 UTC]
I updated <tt>[[icomplete+.el]]</tt> so it works now with Emacs 23 (until they change it again ;-)). For your bug, I need your debug input. Make sure to pick up the latest libraries before testing. Thx. -- DrewAdams

Sorry for the lack of reply.  I've been looking at this again.  Observations:

in icicle-prefix-complete-1, at the point of icicle-abbreviate-or-expand-file-name, things look messed up.  No 2nd arg (for the default dir) is given, and the filename passed in is relative (foo, in the example I gave).    I traced this to icicle-file-name-input-p, which returns a null, incorrectly, I think.  If I set this function to always return true, things work as I would expect.  The method relies of some minubuffer-specific variables which may have changed with the new minibuffer changes in emacs 23.

Here's why it fails:
(stringp minibuffer-completion-predicate) returns nil.  minibuffer-completion-predicate is in fact nil, and stays nil throughout a series of calls in the completion. -- AndrewHyatt

[new:DrewAdams:2008-07-08 15:10 UTC]
Thanks for the update, but I'm afraid it is not clear to me at all and I will need more input to be able to help.

* In reply to my asking about ##(abbreviate-file-name (substitute-in-file-name icicle-current-input))##, you say: ''"No 2nd arg (for the default dir) is given, and the filename passed in is relative (foo, in the example I gave)."'' No second arg should be passed, but in the example you gave, the input was ##~/foo/bar##, not ##foo##. The result of the sexp should be the same as the input, ##~/foo/bar##, as I said. Is it?

* You say ''"I traced this to icicle-file-name-input-p, which returns a null, incorrectly, I think."'' If that is `nil', then the sexp ##(abbreviate-file-name (substitute-in-file-name icicle-current-input))## would not even be evaluated, so I don't really know which part of the code you are referring to.  `icicle-file-name-input-p' should return non-`nil'. If it does not, that is a problem. But I wonder if you have the latest version of '''Icicles''' (which hasn't changed for some time), because `icicle-file-name-input-p' now simply evaluates `minibuffer-completing-file-name'. If that value is `nil', then there should also be a problem with vanilla Emacs.

* You say ''"Here's why it fails:
(stringp minibuffer-completion-predicate) returns nil.  minibuffer-completion-predicate is in fact nil, and stays nil throughout a series of calls in the completion."'' AND ''"in icicle-file-name-input-p, if I replace the stringp with a null, things work, at least for case."'' Again, I wonder if you have the latest '''Icicles'''. Where do you see ##(stringp minibuffer-completion-predicate)## in this code? In the past, that was part of the definition of `icicle-file-name-input-p', but that has not been the case for some time now.

I downloaded a new Windows binary, built on 2008-06-29, and retested (on Windows). I still cannot reproduce the problem. I have a directory ##~/foo/bar##, and I try ##C-x C-f ~/foo/b## (from any directory), and it completes fine, to ##~/foo/bar##. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the recipe, or perhaps the bug is only on a non-Windows platform. I suspect from the above, however, that you might simply not have the latest version of '''Icicles'''.

If not, please let me know just how debugging proceeds in `icicle-prefix-complete-1'-- just where the problem arises. There are several calls to `icicle-file-name-input-p'. Another thing to try is to debug `icicle-unsorted-file-name-apropos-candidates' to see what happens there. It should return a list of all matching file names. There is still a test for ##(stringp minibuffer-completion-predicate)## there that might need to be removed. If you find by debugging that that is the problem (so that you are sure), try commenting out the condition ##(not ##(stringp minibuffer-completion-predicate))## in `icicle-unsorted-file-name-apropos-candidates'.

See also the questions I asked previously:

* When tracing `icicle-file-name-prefix-candidates':
** What does ##(read-file-name-internal "b" "~/foo/" t)## return? It should return ##("bar/")##. And (later), ##(read-file-name-internal "b" "~/foo/" nil)## should return ##"bar/"##.
** What does `icicle-file-name-prefix-candidates' return? It should return ##("bar/")##.
* If everything looks good until this point, what happens in `icicle-save-or-restore-input'? It should return something like ##/home/ahyatt/foo/bar##, that is, ##~/foo/bar##, but with ##~## expanded to your home directory.

Sorry for not being able to find and fix this yet, but I will need some more help from you. Thx -- DrewAdams

Icicles and Gnus attachement:

[new:DrewAdams:2008-05-15 13:43 UTC]
Thanks for your report. I won't be able to take a look at it before this weekend. However, please try to give me a step-by-step recipe to reproduce it, starting with ##emacs -Q## (no InitFile). I don't use gnus, so if you can try to narrow it down further, that would help. You can also try loading the '''Icicles''' source files (not byte-compiled files) and then stepping through the debugger. For example, ##M-x debug-on-entry icicle-find-file## (or whatever command provokes the problem. Finally, keep in mind that Emacs developers are actively changing Emacs 23, and I don't necessarily try to track such changes. If we can find the problem, then I will try to fix it, but Emacs 23 is a moving target, so it's not my priority. Thx -- DrewAdams

[new:DrewAdams:2008-05-17 04:49 UTC]
I will definitely need more info, to look into this. You say "when Icicles is enabled" -- do you mean ''Icicle'' mode? If you turn off ''Icicle'' mode (##M-x icy-mode##) does the problem go away, or does the problem exist just from loading '''Icicles''' and stays a problem, even when ''Icicle'' mode is turned off? I ask this because AFAIK, '''Icicles''' should have nothing to do with inserting a file in gnus as an attachment -- '''Icicles''' should have an effect only when you perform completion (or if you use some top-level '''Icicles''' command).

What is the command you are using when this happens? Are you somehow using completion? If so, which completion keys are you using (`TAB', `S-TAB')? Do you get a similar error if you try to just open the same file using `C-x C-f' (`icicle-find-file')? Does ##/home/dad/~/test.txt## generally work when finding a file -- does it get transformed in the minibuffer to ##~/test.txt## (that is, does the first part get dimmed)? Does the file ##~/test.txt## exist?

Try to trace function `mm-insert-file-contents', after loading the source file ##mm-util.el## and the most recent version of the '''Icicles''' source files. Let me know all you can find out, so I can begin to look into this. In short, you will need to somehow connect the error message to some of the '''Icicles''' code. Otherwise, this is too far afield to be able to guess what is going on. It could be anything from a possible Emacs 23 change in the implementation of `insert-file-contents' to some interaction between the propertized string and file-name completion. I have no idea at this point and no info to go on. Thx -- DrewAdams

[new:DanielDehennin:2008-06-20 20:13 UTC+2]
Sorry for the delay,

I trace mml-attach-file under emacs -Q and see that when icicles is on, the function read-file-name return 
<pre>
#("~/test" 0 6 (auto-composed t))
</pre>

When icicles is off the same function only return the string "~/test".

Does it help you ? -- DanielDehennin

[new:DrewAdams:2008-06-20 20:55 UTC]
Both ###("~/test" 0 6 (auto-composed t))## and ##"~/test"## are strings. The first just has the text property `auto-composed' with value `t'. '''Icicles''' does not apply that text property; it must come from something else you are using -- perhaps GNUS. When GNUS or mml called `read-file-name', your input to `read-file-name' was apparently that propertized string. 

I prefer to let `read-file-name' return whatever string you input, even if it has text properties. That feature could be useful in certain contexts. I introduced doing that for `completing-read', and that has since been added to vanilla Emacs. In the case of `completing-read', it is clearly an advantage. In the case of `read-file-name', I think it could also be useful.

However, I guess I'll have to bend on this one, at least for now, since there is brain-dead code out there that assumes the string returned has no properties. It seems that GNUS or mml or whatever blindly prints the string out as the XML attribute value, without removing its properties. That is, it uses the wrong Lisp print function when building the code. It is amazing to me that it doesn't verify the data it plugs into XML, but you can't argue with the real world. ;-)

I've therefore stripped the text properties in `read-file-name'. Please try the latest <tt>[[icicles-fn.el]]</tt> to see if it fixes your problem. Let me know.

But IMO it is the GNUS or mml or whatever code that is at fault here. There is no reason to limit a general function such as `read-file-name' to returning a string with no properties. It would be nice if you grumbled on a GNUS mailing list that it shouldn't assume that `read-file-name' returns a string with no properties -- send them the XML snippet. There is really no excuse for code that naively plugs in a string as an XML attribute value without checking it first. The fix is for the GNUS code to use the proper Lisp print function when creating the XML code. Anyway, thanks for your report, and let me know... -- DrewAdams

[new:DanielDehennin:2008-06-21 10:00 UTC]
Ok, I understand, that the reason why other part can have properties too when I complete the input with TAB, the problem is obviously from Gnus, I'll send a bug report to the Gnus staff.
Thanks. -- DanielDehennin

[new:DrewAdams:2008-06-21 16:08 UTC]
Thanks for checking. Just to warn you: I will likely revert this fix, since I think '''Icicles''' should stay general about this. I will perhaps add a user option or something to let you choose the behavior. But please do report this as a GNUS bug. Thx -- DrewAdams

[new:DrewAdams:2008-06-22 23:18 UTC]
As I warned, I've reverted the fix. You can now set the new option '''`icicle-unpropertize-completion-result-flag'''' to non-`nil' to achieve the same effect. -- DrewAdams

I'm having some trouble with apropos completion.  When I press S-TAB, shift-tab, I get a message that says: [No prefix completions].  I think that message indicates that apropos completion is not happening, and I don't get any matches for the examples in the Icicles documentation, for example M-x \bes doesn't return any matches.  So I described the key S-tab and it says: 
<pre>
<tab> (translated from <S-tab>) runs the command icicle-prefix-complete
</pre>
I tried this in a vanilla emacs started with --no-init, then loaded icicles using "load-library", then turned on icicles with "icy-mode".  I just updated icicles this last weekend, didn't make a difference.  I looked at 'minibuffer-local-completion-map' to see what  icicle-apropos-complete is bound to: 

 (tab . icicle-prefix-complete)
 (backtab . icicle-apropos-complete)

Are backtab and S-tab the same? The I'm stumped, any help would be appreciated.  -- DavidBoon

[new:DrewAdams:2008-05-19 18:22 UTC]
Oops! Sorry about that. I "improved" the default value because ##[backtab]## is now the canonical representation of all of the `S-TAB' variations (##[S-tab]##, ##[S-iso-lefttab]##). But that is not true until Emacs 22. Should be fixed now. Thanks for the report; sorry for the inconvenience. -- DrewAdams

[new:DavidBoon:]
Maybe that wasn't the problem.  I just downloaded the latest icicles, and still have the same problem.  I asked a friend to describe their "S-TAB" and they get "<backtab> is undefined"   I get "TAB (translated from <S-tab>) runs the command indent-for-tab-command,"

I tried this:
##(define-key minibuffer-local-completion-map [S-tab] 'icicle-apropos-complete)##

And that fixes my issue...maybe a hack for now... -- DavidBoon

[new:DrewAdams:2008-05-20 14:37 UTC]
Hmm. What is the value of option `icicle-generic-S-tab-keys'? If you use Emacs 20 or 21, then it should be, by default, ##([S-tab] [S-iso-lefttab])##, which will make ##[S-tab]## DTRT. If you use Emacs 22 or 23, then ##[backtab]## should work (let me know if that is your case and ##[backtab]## doesn't work). You didn't identify your Emacs version.

If you use Emacs 20 or 21 and the value is still ##[backtab]##, then perhaps you are picking up an old value from your custom-file. If your custom-file has no value for this, then the default value should be ##([S-tab] [S-iso-lefttab])##, and that should work. If not, let me know the details (Emacs version, value in custom-file, etc.).

BTW, you do not want to just bind ##[S-tab]## to `icicle-apropos-complete' in any case -- it should be bound to `icicle-generic-S-tab'. That makes it work for both apropos completion and key completion in Emacs 22 or later, and it makes `S-TAB' move backwards among candidates in buffer `*Completions*'. IOW, `S-TAB' has multiple uses in '''Icicles'''. -- DrewAdams

[new:DrewAdams:2008-05-20 21:29 UTC]
What do you get for `C-h k' when you hit `S-TAB' at the top level (not from the minibuffer) in ''Icicle'' mode? It should say:

<pre>
<backtab> (translated from <S-tab>) runs the command
icicle-generic-S-tab, which is an interactive compiled Lisp function.

It is bound to <backtab>.
</pre>

It sounds like that might not be true in your case.

Next, try using ##([S-tab] [S-iso-lefttab])## as the value of `icicle-generic-S-tab-keys'. 
* If that doesn't work, then the problem is not with ##[backtab]##. Let me know, and we'll dig further.
* If that works, then something is wrong with ##[backtab]## getting mapped to those keys. That would be an Emacs problem. In that case, you might try upgrading to a more recent CVS snapshot. I'm using an Emacs 23 snapshot from 2008-05-04 on Windows, with no problem. It works for me also with Emacs 22. It also works for me with a January 2008 CVS snapshot (Emacs 23), however.

Rereading your first message, my impression is that ##[backtab]## is bound to the right keys in '''Icicles''', but when you hit `S-TAB' Emacs is not translating that to ##[backtab]##. I'm no expert on those low-level key translations. In this case, I suggest you contact an Emacs mailing list -- one of these:

 emacs-devel@gnu.org
 help-gnu-emacs@gnu.org

If that is the case, then there is no relation with '''Icicles''' -- you can use the workaround of skipping ##[backtab]## and using ##[S-tab]## directly. But you should try to find out why Emacs doesn't treat `S-TAB' as ##[backtab]## on your machine. Sounds like an Emacs bug.

BTW, you no longer need `icicle-control-reminder-prompt' and `icicle-prompt-suffix' -- they no longer exist. -- DrewAdams

[new:DavidBoon:2008-05-21 01:10 UTC]
Thanks Drew! Once again your level of support just rules.  Here's what I did to get around it as you suggested: 
(custom-set-variables  
 '(icicle-generic-S-tab-keys '([S-tab] [S-iso-lefttab])))

That works.  When I describe S-tab, I get:
<pre>
<S-tab> runs the command icicle-generic-S-tab, which is an interactive
compiled Lisp function in `icicles-cmd.el'.

It is bound to <S-tab>, <S-iso-lefttab>.
</pre>

My emacs version is: GNU Emacs 23.0.60.1 (i386-mingw-nt5.1.2600) of 2008-02-20 on mymachine
Which is pretty recent.  I reverted back to this version when the emacs trunk seemed unstable in the last week or so since the font-backend changes where merged in. 

With a very recent build(GNU Emacs 23.0.60.1 (i386-mingw-nt5.1.2600) of 2008-05-19 on U0103223-XPA), S-tab is translated to backtab correctly:
<pre>
<backtab> (translated from <S-tab>) runs the command backward-button,
which is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `button.el'.

It is bound to <backtab>, M-TAB.

</pre>
So this is not really an icicles bug and probably will work fine once I get back to using a recent trunk build.  Thanks for helping me out. -- DavidBoon

Regarding the backtab/S-tab/S-iso-tab problem,, I just want to report that it is broken on my system as well: GNU Emacs 22.2.1 (i386-apple-darwin8.11.1, Carbon Version 1.6.0).  I wonder if this problem is specific to Emacs 22/Mac OS 10.4?

The suggested fix works for me, but only if it precedes the (icy-mode 1) form:
<pre>
  (require 'icicles)
  (setq icicle-generic-S-tab-keys '([S-tab] [S-iso-lefttab]))
  (icy-mode 1)
</pre>

Perhaps that should be mentioned in the `icicle-generic-S-tab-keys' doc string. -- KevinRodgers

[new:DrewAdams:2008-08-21 15:32 UTC]
I think you're saying that `backtab' is apparently not being translated to `S-tab' and `S-iso-lefttab' on Mac OS 10.4. Is that correct? If so, please file an Emacs bug for that.

I've added a note in the doc string, as you suggest, though bugs and workarounds are not usually part of the normal doc (as opposed, e.g., to release notes etc.).

Wrt the code you use: Does it not work for you to customize `icicle-generic-S-tab-keys' (using [[Customize]])? If so, there might be an '''Icicles''' bug here. If not, that is the recommended way to go. I prefer not to get into telling people to use code such as you wrote, if Customize does the job correctly. 

IIUC, there is no '''Icicles''' bug here. Let me know if I misunderstand. Thx -- DrewAdams

[new]
Yes, in the Mac OS window system Emacs does not see S-tab or S-iso-lefttab.  In Emacs -Q `C-h k S-<tab>' says:

    TAB (translated from <S-tab>) runs the command indent-for-tab-command

I believe you that this is an Emacs bug, but I can't find any reference to backtab in the Emacs manual, the Emacs Lisp manual, or the NEWS file to support that so I'm not comfortable reporting it.

I appreciate your disdain for polluting the Icicles doc strings with notes like that -- perhaps a comment in the source instead would be enough for now.

And I understand your preference for using Customize, but I intend to stick to .emacs :-)

Thanks! -- KevinRodgers

[new:DrewAdams:2008-08-22 06:03 UTC]
I did add a note to the doc string, as I mentioned: 

 In Emacs 22 and later, `backtab' is the canonical key that represents
 both `S-tab' and `S-iso-lefttab', so that is used in the default
 value.  If, for some reason, `backtab' is not being translated to
 `S-tab' and `S-iso-lefttab' on your platform, you might want to
 customize the value to ([S-tab] [S-iso-lefttab]).  And if your Emacs
 version is 22 or later, please file an Emacs bug about the lack of
 translation.

Wrt reporting the bug: StefanMonnier stated that `backtab' is now the "canonical" form of Shift + Tab in Emacs, and he said that if it's not getting properly translated then it's a bug. I suggested that this be documented and he (and others) agreed. I don't know if that has been done yet. Here is the thread: http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2008-05/msg00256.html

Does that make you feel any better about reporting it? ;-) It's better if you are the one to report it, since you see it and can provide any details they might need.

Moved this to IciclesIssuesClosed. Thx -- DrewAdams

Icicles tab-completion does not work with current emacs 23 from cvs. this

 Find file: ~/src/

becomes after pressing tab

 File or directory: src

-- HannesJanetzek


[new:DrewAdams:2008-04-30 05:32 UTC]
I assume you mean ##File or directory:## as the prompt in both cases (not ##Find file:## in the first case), right? If not, then you need to explain what command you used -- `icicle-find-file' should use the same prompt always.

I cannot test Emacs 23 on UNIX or GNU/Linux, and I don't see the equivalent on Windows. I tried with a January build of Emacs 23 on Windows, and it behaves normally.

After pressing `TAB' the minibuffer should stay the same -- in your case that would be ##File or directory: ~/src/## -- but the contents of that directory should be shown as candidates in `*Completions*'. That is what I see on Windows and also what I see with Emacs 22 on GNU/Linux.

To go further with this, you'll need to provide some more information. Start with ##emacs -Q## (no ##.emacs##); then load only the '''Icicles''' source files (not the byte-compiled files); then ##M-x debug-on-entry icicle-find-file##; then `C-x C-f' and step through the debugger.

Keep in mind that CVS Emacs is a development version and is not necessarily supported by '''Icicles'''. There are currently lots of Emacs bugs in that version, and they are playing with some of the C-language completion code as we speak. Dunno if that's related. Dunno if what you're seeing is an '''Icicles''' problem or an Emacs problem. Can you try with Emacs 22, 21, or 20? If not, please try using the debugger to provide some more info. 

You can also report the info by email via ##M-x icicle-send-bug-report## -- DrewAdams

[new:DrewAdams:2008-04-30 06:28 UTC]
Actually, I suspect that this is an Emacs bug introduced in the last day or two. See the thread "##a bug rendering ido unusable##" in ##emacs-devel@gnu.org##[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2008-04/msg02064.html]. This seems to be the conclusion:

: "It turns out the problem is in file-name-all-completions:
 for some reason, it fails to add the expected trailing / on directories." -- StefanMonnier

So please test also with ''Icicle'' mode turned off to see if you get the same problem. Thx -- DrewAdams

[new:DrewAdams:2008-04-30 13:44 UTC]
Stefan says that Emacs bug should be fixed now in CVS. Please let me know if this is really what you ran into or if the problem still exists. -- DrewAdams

[new:HannesJanetzek:2008-04-30 18:44 UTC]
I wasnt sure if this is an emacs bug or if Icicles is not up to date with recent changes of Emacs. Probably it's a bug in Emacs. Yes, I mean icicles-find-file and the icicles version bzr rev 128 worked until now. The debugging method you mention above didnt showed anything after pressing tab. I started to track down where the bug was introduced. But it needs a bootstrap each time I try, so this might take a while. the checkout from 04-09 23:25 is the last working version i've found. so somewhere between then and 04-23 7:15 the bug appeared.. The todays version does not work. --HannesJanetzek

[new:HannesJanetzek:2008-04-30 20:25 UTC]
Ok, I found the commit causing the trouble. it is  "(Qdefault_directory): New variable." from 2008-04-21 23:26:00. Drew could you have a look this? I guess Icicles makes an assumption of what should be returned which doesnt hold anymore. -- HannesJanetzek

[new:DrewAdams:2008-04-30 23:01 UTC]
I don't update '''Icicles''' wrt CVS changes -- that's what I was saying above. If someone identifies a problem and I can see how the Emacs 23 Lisp code changed to provoke the problem, then I generally update '''Icicles''' to accommodate the change. But I am not trying to keep '''Icicles''' up-to-date wrt Emacs CVS as it evolves. Later, when it becomes more stable, I will attempt that. There are far too many Emacs bugs now and the code changes too often.

AFAIK, '''Icicles''' makes no assumptions beyond the signatures of the standard Lisp functions and the behavior of the standard variables, such as `default-directory'. If those change, then sometimes I need to update '''Icicles'''.  If you can determine any such Lisp interface changes, let me know, and I'll try to take them into account.

Please try without '''Icicles''', to see if you still see the problem. Then try with '''Icicles''' but with ''Icicle'' mode turned off, in case just loading '''Icicles''' provokes the problem. Then, please step through the debugger, letting me know what you see.

I don't know what you mean by "debugging method you mention above didnt showed anything after pressing tab". If the error is raised during execution of `icicle-find-file', then stepping through that function should show where things go wrong. You can also try setting `debug-on-error' to `t' and see what that backtrace shows. (Always use only source files, not byte-compiled files, for debugging.)

If this is an Emacs bug, and it was not fixed by Stefan's fix, then it should be reported using ##M-x report-emacs-bug##. You will need to give a narrow recipe, starting with ##emacs -Q##. Either way, '''Icicles''' bug or Emacs bug, it needs to be narrowed down some in order to tackle it. -- DrewAdams

[new:DrewAdams:2008-05-01 22:03 UTC]
FYI - Dunno if it affects this bug, but I just fixed another bug introduced by an Emacs 23 change (which allows a list of default values for minibuffer read functions). You might give the latest <tt>[[icicles-fn.el]]</tt> a try. -- DrewAdams

[new:DrewAdams:2008-05-05 23:33 UTC]
I made a change that seems to fix it, at least on Windows. Please try the latest and let me know. Thx - DrewAdams

When trying to visit a file, Emacs hangs without showing a prompt and finally returns back with the following message: condition-case: Variable binding depth exceeds max-specpdl-size
This happens even if I use find-file-literally, which shouldn't care about Icicles at all, AFAIK; and even if icicle-mode is deactivated (after being activated at start-up).

The really weird thing: this only seems to happen if Icicles is loaded during start-up. If I do 

 (require 'icicles)
 (icicle-mode t)

_after_ start-up, there is a slight pause before the prompt shows, but it does show. Is there _any_ reason this should matter? --AlexeyRomanov

[new:DrewAdams:2008-04-20 21:15 UTC]
This is an important bug, obviously. Please help by getting some more info for me. I don't want to scare you off by the long request that follows -- any information at all that you can provide will help. But the more you can tell me, the more I can help.

I assume you are using the latest '''Icicles''' files (if not, please do). What is your platform/OS?

What I really need is a step-by-step recipe to reproduce the problem, starting with ##emacs -Q## (that is, no ##.emacs##). First, however, get rid of any byte-compiled '''Icicles''' libraries, so you load only the Lisp source files.

Do ''not'' use your ##.emacs## file for testing, in particular. Do not use any other libraries except '''Icicles'''. Definitely, do not use anything that restores state from some previous Emacs invocation. (It is possible that you have out-of-date info saved in a ##desktop## file or your `custom-file' -- '''Icicles''' info, for example. You must not let Emacs see this.)

What does evaluating this give in your Emacs version immediately after ##emacs -Q## (i.e. without loading '''Icicles'''): ##(boundp 'read-file-name-function)##? What does evaluating this give: ##(symbol-function 'read-file-name)##?

For Emacs 22 and later, '''Icicles''' now takes advantage of variable `read-file-name-function', instead of redefining `read-file-name'. This change is no doubt at the heart of the problem you see, but I don't know what the problem is. If you know EmacsLisp a little, you can check the values of some variables and use the debugger a bit to see what is going on.

If you have Emacs 22 or 23, this is what should happen when you enter ''Icicle'' mode:

* `icicle-old-read-file-name-function' gets set to the value of `read-file-name-function'.
* `read-file-name-function' gets set to `icicle-read-file-name'.

When you exit ''Icicle'' mode:

* `icicle-old-read-file-name-function' gets set to the value of `read-file-name-function'.
* `read-file-name-function' gets set to the value of `icicle-old-read-file-name-function' .

`read-file-name' does its work by calling the value of `read-file-name-function'. In ''Icicle'' mode, this is `icicle-read-file-name'. When not in ''Icicle'' mode, this is whatever it was when you loaded '''Icicles'''. In ##emacs -Q##, this will be `nil'. If you have loaded some other library before '''Icicles''', and that library sets `read-file-name', then that value is restored when you quit ''Icicle'' mode.

When `icicle-read-file-name' is called, it binds `read-file-name-function' to `nil' and then calls the value of `icicle-old-read-file-name-fn' (or `read-file-name', if `nil'). This means that it calls whatever the value of `read-file-name-function' was before entering ''Icicle'' mode. That means that '''Icicles''' can now do its read-file thing on top of whatever other libraries might do to read files.

So please check the values of those variables: after loading '''Icicles''' and with ''Icicle'' mode and without it. Check twice, to see if exiting is the same as never having entered etc. You can also check ##(symbol-function 'read-file-name)## with ''Icicle'' mode and without it.

If you can, please also try ##M-x debug-on-entry icicle-read-file-name##, and then use `C-x C-f' and step through the debugger using `c' and `d'. (Make sure you don't use byte-compiled files.) Follow along looking at the source code while you do this, and let me know what you see. You can send me parts of the debugger backtrace that you think are helpful.

My suspicion and my hope is that the problem will go away with ##emacs -Q##. I suspect that there is something in your InitFile or `custom-file' or some other saved file that is restoring out-of-date state from a past version of '''Icicles'''.

Please let me know everything you can. Use ##M-x icicle-send-bug-report## to send me the info by email, if you can. That will be easier than communicating here.

Thanks very much for your help, Alexey. Sorry for the inconvenience. -- DrewAdams

`icicle-find-file` does not show *.map files as completion candidates. Reproduced as follows:

# Create more than two files with same name but different extensions including map as one of them: for example, hello.map, hello.c...
# Run `runemacs -Q`
# Evaluate `(require 'icicles)
# Evaluate `(icy-mode)`
# Invoke `icicle-find-file`, type hello and press tab. You will see hello.c is Sole prefix completion while there is hello.map too.

Hi, I'm having an issue with completion of files in 'default-directory', I'm using C-x C-f(icicle-find-file).  When I'm in the minibuffer, and I'm editing the default file path, for  example deleting directories or even just typing.  I suspect that the text I'm typing may be getting interpreted as remote paths. See the 'NET USE' below.  I first noticed this when my shell-file-name was set to "bash.exe", I was noticing pretty slow response, so I nil'd that, and I also have the same behavior with cmdproxy.  I started emacs with "runemacs --no-init" then I manually evaluated the loading of icicles all by itself in order to isolate the behavior.  This is output from procmon from sysinternals, which shows emacs trying to map my f: drive, which is local.  I do notice however, when editing the minibuffer when it includes a path like ~/somepath/somedir this problem doesn't happen.  Only seems to occur when I'm editing something that includes a colon in the path...

[new:DrewAdams:2008-03-29 04:30 UTC]
Thanks for the report, David. I will need your help if I'm to figure this out. 

It might depend on what Tramp version you have. I don't really master all that Tramp does in terms of trying to handle remote files. I spent a lot of time with Michael Albinus trying to work something out, so Tramp could be kept at bay. Supposedly, he has taken care of things in the Tramp code, but I don't know what Tramp version he fixed this in. You might try uncommenting the binding of `tramp-completion-mode' in `icicle-call-then-update-Completions' (and add a right paren at the function end) to see if that helps with your version of Tramp.

'''Icicles''' tries to test for a remote file, including a mapped network drive, and it then avoids going to tramp for a remote file name. The function `icicle-file-remote-p' tries to take care of this. On Windows, it calls ##NET USE## to test whether a drive is local or a mapped network drive. This code works for me, with both ##bash## (which is what I use, with Cygwin) and with ##cmdproxy##. It is hard for me to determine what might be going wrong in your context. 

I did have another user report a similar problem, but the problem was apparently with his system's network settings or something, and it magically got fixed (!). One thing to try would be to see what happens if you issue a ##NET USE## call outside Emacs, to simulate what '''Icicles''' does. If you are comfortable with Windows commands and if you can read the EmacsLisp code for `icicle-file-remote-p', then you can try to see what the problem is. The ##NET USE## call should not take long at all -- that's the reason I call it: to avoid accessing a network drive. It should return ##0## for a mapped network drive but not for a local drive.

If you don't make progress finding the problem, then there are some things you can do to prevent '''Icicles''' from trying so hard. See [[Icicles - Icompletion]], in particular, [[Icicles - Icompletion#toc4]]. There are two places where '''Icicles''' calls `icicle-remote-file-p': (1) for incremental completion and (2) for highlighting non-matching input. For #1, you can turn off incremental completion at any time via `##C-###', which toggles option ‘icicle-incremental-completion-flag’. For #2, you can customize options ‘icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure’, ‘icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure-delay’, and ‘icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure-threshold’.

It's a shame to give up either of these features, but if you must, you must. I would like to fix the problem, whatever it is, but I will need more info, since I can't reproduce it here. If you have the time, you might share your findings with Michael Albinus (the Tramp maintainer), if Tramp is implicated, as I suspect.

One thing you might try first is ##M-x debug-on-entry icicle-file-remote-p## (after loading ##icicles-fn.el##, not ##icicles-fn.elc##). Then step through the debugger. For a local drive (e.g. ##c:##), I get `nil' for all three `or' branches. Perhaps the last branch, which uses `file-remote-p', is giving you non-`nil'? Perhaps I can skip the second and third branches if the file name matches a Windows drive letter (since the first branch already takes care of that)? 

IOW, perhaps this would be better. I'm not sure if it is sufficient, but you might want to experiment with it:

  (defun icicle-file-remote-p (file)
   (if (and (eq system-type 'windows-nt)
             (let ((case-fold-search t))
               (string-match "\\`\\([a-z]:\\)" file)))
        (eq 0 (condition-case nil
                  (call-process shell-file-name nil nil nil
                                shell-command-switch
                                (concat "NET USE " (match-string 1 file)))
                (error nil)))
      (or (and (fboundp 'ffap-file-remote-p) (ffap-file-remote-p file))
          (and (fboundp 'file-remote-p) (file-remote-p file)))))

Please let me know what you try and what you find out. Sorry for the inconvenience. -- DrewAdams

[new:DrewAdams:2008-03-29 21:30 UTC]
I changed the definition of `icicle-file-remote-p' to that shown above. Let me know if that helps. To try it, just eval that definition (and then toggle `icy-mode' twice). Otherwise, you will need to download all of the '''Icicles''' files, because I updated all of them this morning. -- DrewAdams


[new]
I tried the new definition of `icicle-file-remote-p',   It seems to help a little.  Typing in the minbuffer is a little more responsive.  But, still noticably slow.  When I remove, by commenting out, the section that invokes the 'net use', responsiveness in the minibuffer is excellent.  So I think it's definately the 'net use'.  The one thing that seems odd is that 'net use' is invoked a lot, for just about every character I type.

[new:DrewAdams:2008-03-31 14:49 UTC]
See `icicle-Completions-display-min-input-chars' and the other variables I mentioned, for tuning ([[Icicles - Icompletion#toc4]]). If you don't, yes, it is tested for each edit, to detect whether the input is a non-match. That's the point. And that's why there are options to not do that in specific (or all) contexts. You should be able to find satisfactory behavior with those options. If not, let me know what the problem is. -- DrewAdams

For some reason `S-TAB' works as key completion even in minibuffer for me. 
It is bound to `icicle-generic-S-tab' (checked with `C-h k'). Icicle-apropos-complete works properly when called by M-x or from Minibuf menu.

I use the latest patched EmacsW32.

Icicles prompt shows ##<S-iso-lefttab>## instead of ##<S-tab>##, and I am not sure what key "iso" is supposed to mean. -- AlexeyRomanov

[new:DrewAdams:2008-03-08 22:51 UTC]
It means that your keyboard's `S-TAB' key is actually ##<S-iso-lefttab>##, not ##<S-tab>##. '''Icicles''' takes care of both types of keyboard. -- DrewAdams

[new:2008-02-28 8:55 UTC]
The same happens for me when i switch on CuaMode. I've tried to track this down and ended up in the icicle-completing-p function. The expression:

      (where-is-internal 'icicle-candidate-action nil 'first-only)

returns nil when cua-mod is enabled (without CUA mode, it evaluates to something != nil and everything is fine). -- KaiTetzlaff

[new:2008-03-08 15:04 UTC]
So is there a way to deal with this (without leaving CuaMode)? -- AlexeyRomanov

[new:DrewAdams:2008-03-08 22:37 UTC]
FYI -- 

1. A minor mode keymap (such as `cua-global-keymap') overrides all local keymaps (such as `minibuffer-local-completion-map').

2. CuaMode apparently binds `C-RET' to `cua-set-rectangle-mark' in the minor-mode keymap `cua-global-keymap'.

3. '''Icicles''', in order to determine whether completion is in effect, tests whether `icicle-candidate-action' is bound. It is bound to `C-RET' normally, but CUA mode's minor-mode binding overrides that. 

4. Other tests for completing are more expensive. Nevertheless, I've changed it now, so that it should work in this case. Please try the latest version.

5. ''However'', I cannot recommend that you use CUA mode with '''Icicles'''. It's untested. Unlike '''Icicles''', which binds mainly minibuffer keys, CUA mode binds tons of keys at the top (minor-mode) level, and these will all override the minibuffer key bindings, which are local. So you're on your own if you try to use CUA mode at the same time as '''Icicles'''. 

6. I expect that you will need to bind one or more keys differently, to accommodate both CUA mode and '''Icicles'''. At a minimum, you will need to either (a) bind `cua-set-rectangle-mark' to something besides `C-RET' in CUA mode or (b) bind `icicle-candidate-action' to something besides `C-RET' in each of the minibuffer completion maps when you are in ''Icicle'' mode.

7. More generally, I recommend that you wean yourself from CUA mode. I go back and forth all the time between Emacs, with its normal, non-CUA bindings, and MS Windows apps, with their CUA bindings, such as `C-v'. If I can do it, so can you. It might take some getting used to, but it is well worth it, IMO. Do as you like, of course -- just a word to the wise. -- DrewAdams

Filename completion seems to be broken for me. I have a directory ##F:\MyProgramming##.
When I try to use `icicle-find-file' and enter ##F:\MyProg <tab>## it doesn't find any prefix completions;
If I enter ##F:/MyProg <tab>## it completes to ##MyProgramming\##, losing ##F:##. -- AlexeyRomanov

[new:DrewAdams:2008-03-08 21:41 UTC]
Use ##F:/##, not ##F:\##. See http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/Icicles_-_Special_Characters_in_Input_Patterns. -- DrewAdams

[new:AlexeyRomanov:2008-03-09 09:08 UTC]
As I said, in this case it completed to ##MyProgramming/## (not ##\##, as I wrote above), which is interpreted as a subdirectory of the current directory. This turned out to be because insert-default-directory was nil. I changed it back to t and it works correctly now. -- AlexeyRomanov

[new:DrewAdams:2008-03-09 18:39 UTC]
No, it's not about `insert-default-directory'. The reason changing that back to `t' helped is that the directory that is then inserted uses '''`/'''', not '''`\''''. In '''Icicles''', always use '''`/'''' as the directory separator -- always. Then, you will have no problem, with or without `insert-default-directory'. -- DrewAdams

I am using emacs 21.3.1 on RHEL 3 

I have been using icicles for a while, but only using basic functions like S-TAB.  I recently decided to try the progressive completion feature, but have not been able to get it to work.  I updated icicles today 2007-Feb-28 (in case the problem had been fixed, but alas it is still not working for me). To do the update, I use the 'M-x icicles-download-wizard'.  I then byte compile when prompted.  Finally I exit emacs and restart emacs to test the new version of icicles.  BTW,  is there a way to print the icicles version?

When I try to follow the example on the progressive completion page, Step one works fine.  'C-h f char S-TAB' produces a list of functions containing "char"
However when I try the next step 'M-*' produces the following message: "No previous locations for find-tag invocation".  Not sure what is wrong.

Pressing 'C-h k' and then pressing 'M-*' produces "M-* runs the command icicle-pop-tag-mark"  (I even tried this while in the mini-buffer after using S-TAB to see if it the key was rebound  in the minibuffer, but apparently not).

Not sure if that is the problem, that the key is not being rebound in the minibuffer in my case.  -- IanPerryman

[new:DrewAdams:2008-02-28 16:27 UTC]
Thanks for your report. What version of Emacs are you using?

'''Icicles''' has no version number per se. Instead, each '''Icicles''' library has an '''`##Update ###'''' in the file header, which is updated automatically at each save.

I suspect that something in your InitFile is interfering somehow. Please try again, starting from ##emacs -Q## (or ##emacs -q --no-site-file##), to bypass your init file. If the problem goes away, then we can check what's happening in your init file.

It is fine that the global key binding of `M-*' be `icicle-pop-tag-mark'. The global binding should be irrelevant here, because `M-*' should have a local binding in the minibuffer completion keymaps.

To check the minibuffer binding, load library <tt>[[help-fns+.el]]</tt> (or <tt>[[help+20.el]]</tt> if you use a version of Emacs prior to 22). Then use `C-h M-k' and enter one of the minibuffer completion keymap names -- e.g. `minibuffer-local-completion-map'. You should see this binding of `M-*' in the list:

 M-*             icicle-narrow-candidates

If you don't want to load the help-enhancement library, then just use `C-h v minibuffer-local-completion-map', but in that case you will need to look for ##(27 keymap ... (42 . icicle-narrow-candidates)...)##:

  ...
  (27 keymap
     (25 . icicle-yank-secondary)
     (58 . icicle-pp-eval-expression)
     (67108902 . icicle-save-predicate-to-variable)
     (38 . icicle-narrow-candidates-with-predicate)
     (42 . icicle-narrow-candidates)
     ...

I expect, from your description, that you won't find `M-*' bound to `icicle-narrow-candidates' in this minibuffer keymap, and that is the problem. But I expect that there is something in your init file that is causing this.

Let me know what you find out. Thx -- DrewAdams

Thanks for the reply Drew

I am using emacs 21.3.1 on RHEL in a X-Windows environment (Gnome) ... you may have missed it at the top of the original post.
I get the same problem with "emacs -q --no-site-file"

When I loaded the help+20.el file and dumped the key bindings for minibuffer-local-completion-map, I get about 444 lines of stuff ... too much to post here.
However, of note there are many bindings that look like C-<char> bound to various icicle funcitons but only few M-<char> and all of these are in <> like this:

%%<M-S-delete>%%	icicle-erase-minibuffer

Then there are lots of ESC <char> type bindings including:

ESC *		icicle-narrow-candidates

However when I press that sequence (literally using the escape key and the *) I get the same behaviour as when I use the Alt key (which is my Meta key).  It is the same for both Alt-L and Alt-R if that matters.  In any case I get the same "No previous locations for find-tag invocation". 

(BTW, this was working previously since I made a post several months ago when I first started using icicles.) -- IanPerryman


[new:DrewAdams:2008-02-28 21:40 UTC]
Should be fixed now. Thanks for your help.

FYI, the problem was that `pop-to-mark' is bound starting with Emacs 21 to `M-*' (it doesn't exist in Emacs 20). And command remapping isn't available until Emacs 22. So, for Emacs 20 and 21, I use `substitute-key-definition', instead of remapping. Well, since a minor-mode keymap takes precedence over even a local keymap such as minibuffer bindings, the `M-*' binding in `icicle-mode', namely `icicle-pop-tag-mark', was taking precedence over `icicle-narrow-candidates'. The same problem exists for `M-.', but I had already taken care of that. Please try the latest <tt>[[icicles-mode.el]]</tt>. Thx -- DrewAdams

I'm getting similar results to dsl5402B33F.pool.t-online.hu at IciclesDiscussion, only I'm not in ClearCase -- just roaming local and networked drives.

I was using an old version of Icicles (Last-Updated: Wed Mar 14 16:48:05 2007 (-25200 Pacific Daylight Time) Update #: 20754) and it worked fine.  I just updated to the latest (Last-Updated: Sun Jan 13 13:56:00 2008 (-28800 Pacific Standard Time)Update #: 22004) and that is when the slowness started.

If I do a C-x C-f, it can take 2-3 seconds before the prompt appears. When I type in a directory, it can take up to 8 seconds before the cursor comes backup.

I tried what the user did above:
##(setq icicle-incremental-completion-threshold 0)##

##(setq icicle-incremental-completion-delay 1)##

And that did nothing to my slowness.  Again, it works fine with the older version and I'm not sure what changed. -- MikeHostetler

[new:DrewAdams:2008-01-22 23:57 UTC]
Sorry to hear that. I can think of a couple of possibilities you might check.

You can test whether the slowness is due to incremental completion, by toggling that off (`C-#' in the minibuffer).

What is the value of option `icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure-flag'? If it is `t', try setting it to `nil' to see if that helps. Toggling incremental completion off also turns this option off, so if `C-#' solves the problem, then you might try just setting `icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure-flag' to `nil' instead of turning off incremental completion.

I notice that with this (very useful) option turned on in Emacs 22 inputting characters is noticeably slower. I don't know why this would be true only for Emacs 22 (not Emacs 20). 

If the slowdown is mainly annoying in some contexts (e.g. file-name completion), and you want to keep the benefit of input non-match highlighting most of the time, then you might want to use `C-#' in those problematic contexts. If the problem is in fact mainly for file-name completion, thenaAnother solution is to set the option to `strict-only' -- the highlighting will then appear only for strict completion. (File-name completion is usually lax, not strict.)

What is the value of option `icicle-add-proxy-candidates-flag'? It should be nil. (You can toggle it in the minibuffer using `##C-M-_##'.)

Other than that, I have no clue. Let me know what you find wrt these suggestions. -- DrewAdams

[new:MikeHostetler 2008-01-23:2008-01-23 13:58 UTC]

Setting ##icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure-flag## to nil did the trick.  It's still slower than before, but not annoyingly so. `C-#' did make it faster yet but I like incremental completion,  so I turned it back on and turned off `icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure-flag' and it's very usable now.

`icicle-add-proxy-candidates-flag' was nil the whole time.

From your explanation, I did fail to understand what to set to `strict-only'.  Yes, this does seem to only happen with filename completion -- command completion is very snappy.

I failed to say what I was running -- NTmacs 22, which bills itself as: `GNU Emacs 22.1.50.1 (i386-mingw-nt5.1.2600'

Thanks for your help -- and a great package! -- MikeHostetler

[new:DrewAdams:2008-01-23 15:45 UTC]
Glad to see you solved it. Dunno why file-name completion is slow on Emacs 22. What I meant about `strict-only' is that you can customize `icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure-flag' to `strict-only', since file-name completion is (usually) lax. In Customize, the value is listed in the '''Value''' menu as ##Only during strict completion##. The actual value this gives is `strict-only'.

I will see if I can tell why Emacs 22 has a problem with file-name completion. Perhaps I will also set the default value to `strict-only', but that seems a shame. Thanks for the report. -- DrewAdams


[new:MikeHostetler :2008-01-23 17:46 UTC]

Okay, I tried setting `icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure-flag' to `strict-only' and that sped things up, but still annoying.  I went back to to setting it to nil and it's much better

FWIW -- Part of this may be that I spend as much time on network drives as I do local ones.  With `strict-only' the local drives are much snappier than the network.  Still, there was no difference when using Icicles from a year ago -- even with Emacs 22. -- MikeHostetler

[new:DrewAdams:2008-01-23 22:46 UTC]
That's interesting. That shouldn't happen. If you are completing a remote file name, then there should be no attempt to highlight the non-matching input. I would like to find and fix this bug.

Would you please test this for me? You can correspond by email; that would be easier: you can use `M-x icicle-send-bug-report' to get the email address.

Warning: The test will be a pain (but it will be short), because `icicle-highlight-input-noncompletion' is called each time you type a character. If you need to turn it off, the quickest way is ##M-: (cancel-debug-on-entry)##. That will bypass input updating -- it will take you forever to do `M-x cancel-debug-on-entry'.

To test:

1. Load the source code (not the byte-compiled code) of at least <tt>[[icicles-fn.el]]</tt>.

2. Toggle twice: `M-x icy-mode' `M-x icy-mode' to refresh to the source definition.

3. Set `icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure-flag' to non-`nil'.

4. `M-x debug-on-entry icicle-highlight-input-noncompletion RET'.

5. Try to type a remote file name using, e.g., `C-x C-f', or whatever you were doing that manifested the problem.

What ''should'' happen is that the first branch of the `cond' is taken, because ##(icicle-file-name-input-p)##, ##(fboundp 'file-remote-p)##, and ##(file-remote-p input)## ''should'' each return non-`nil'. It seems, however, that one of them is returning `nil' in your case. I want to learn why. If it is the first, then please descend into `icicle-file-name-input-p' to see if you can tell why. 

Question: Are you using Tramp? If so, which version? I had a lot of trouble with this, and Michael Albinus, the Tramp maintainer, fixed a few Tramp problems in this regard, but perhaps you have an older version or perhaps there are still some problems there. If Tramp is the problem, could you perhaps try using FTP as the Tramp method, to see if that bypasses the problem (just for a test). Also, you might try uncommenting the `let' binding of `tramp-completion-mode' in `icicle-call-then-update-Completions' (and add another `##)##' at the end).

This is an important bug. I realize that you already have a workaround, but I would really like to find out what is happening here.
Sorry for all the trouble. Again, feel free to email me. Thx -- DrewAdams

[new:DrewAdams:2008-01-30 18:52 UTC]
I've rewritten the code that highlights input mismatches. I improved the performance and I provided finer tuning in the option `icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure' (and removed the suffix `-flag' from its name).  In particular, you can now choose to never try to highlight mismatches in remote file names, or to do that only on demand (`TAB' or `S-TAB'). 
 
I also added treatment of Windows mapped network drives as remote files. There is nothing we can do about the time needed to access remote files, but now you can avoid input highlighting for them without turning off the highlighting for local file names. 
 
The highlighting code itself is snappier now, especially when the mismatch portion which gets highlighted is large - such as what happens when you yank a lot of mismatching text into the minibuffer or you delete a character that is far from the end. I use a binary search now, instead of proceeding a character at a time from the end. Please try the latest version. -- DrewAdams

Today I installed icicles with get_icicles.sh script. After running emacs with emacs -q -l .emacs_test, where .emacs_test file is:
(setq load-path
      (append (list "~/elisp/icicles) load-path))
(require 'icicles)
(icy-mode 1)
I get strange results. Namely, typing "C-h f char S-TAB" gives no completion, while typing "C-h f delete S-TAB" gives completion list where there are functions containing "char" substring. Any idea what's wrong?

Icicles is really nice, but found one quirk that may be a bug.  I am using icicles on a Linux system (RHEL3) emacs 21.3.1.  Say I start emacs in my home directory and I want to open a file that happens to be in a sub directory (say "sub"), but there are lots of files in that directory with similar names, but the one I want is the only one with "foo" in it.  

I hit `C-x' `C-f' s u b `S-TAB' `M-*' f o o `S-TAB' RET

This opens an empty buffer in my home directory with the name of the file from the sub directory.  How do I get the relative path (i.e. sub) of the file to be included in what gets returned to find-file so that the correct file is opened. -- rtp-isp-nat1.cisco.com

[new:DrewAdams:2007-09-20 17:38 UTC]
What you describe works for me. I probably need some more info, such as what happens when you hit `S-TAB' the first time -- e.g., whether there are other completions for `sub' besides `sub' itself. Please describe your directory structure and the files/directories whose names match `sub' and `foo'.

If there is only one completion for `sub', then when you hit `S-TAB' for it you need not follow that with `##M-*##'. You use `##M-*##' only when you want to narrow the current set of completion candidates by filtering it with an additional regexp. IOW, `##M-*##' at the place where you used it can only narrow the choices for the subdirectory. If you then type `foo', you are saying that you are looking for a file or directory that matches both `sub' and `foo'.

Here, I think, is what you want to do: 

  C-x C-f  s u b  S-TAB  f o o  S-TAB RET

That assumes that there is only one file/directory that matches `sub'. If that's not the case, then you will need to either type some more and use completion (possibly progressive completion, `##M-*##') or cycle to get to the subdirectory you want. Then, when the minibuffer input shows the complete name for that subdirectory, just hit `S-TAB' (or `TAB') to see all of its files as candidates. (If you cycled to get to the subdir name, then move the cursor first, to show that the subdir is the candidate you want.) Then type `##foo S-TAB##' to complete to the file you want.

It's easier to do than to describe. Essentially, you complete a single file or directory name at a time: first the subdir, then the file within the subdir. That's the way Emacs file-name completion works: The last part of a file-name is completed in the directory named by the first part. When a directory is the minibuffer input and you hit `TAB' or `S-TAB', all of its children (files and subdirectories) are displayed in `*Completions*' as the candidates. But first you need to complete the directory name (`sub') itself. Just play with it a bit, hitting `TAB' or `S-TAB' when you have a full directory name in the minibuffer; you'll see what I mean.

HTH - Let me know what you see, and if you still think you see a bug. -- DrewAdams

[new]
Thanks for the update ... 

Your modified sequence does the right thing ... Thanks... However, I don't understand why my sequence does not work.  Your sequence is fine if I know a priori what the unique identifier in the filename is, however, I often don't know, so I want to look at the completion list, and then narrow the search.

The directory `sub' is unique.  When I pres `S-TAB' the first time, it is to get a list of all the files in the `sub' directory.  I guess it is such habit to just hit `TAB', I forgot that I really typed `TAB' to get find file to stick the `/', after s u b and then I hit the `S-TAB' to get the list of files in the directory in the completions window.  I then hit `M-*' to search for the filename with foo in it.  I hit the S-TAB' to get the completion, since the string foo is unique in the filename that I am looking for.  However, the string that is returned in my minibuffer is only the filename, it does not include the 'sub/' needed to visit the correct file.  So emacs opens an empty buffer visiting a file in my home directory with the name of the file that I am looking for from the sub directory.

<pre>
My dir structure is like this:
    ~/home/
        sub/
           random_prefix1_a
           some_other_prefix_b
           yet_another_c
    ...
           the_file_i_am_looking_for_but_dont_know_the_prefix_foo
    ...
           file_etc
</pre>

Thanks, IanPerryman

[new:DrewAdams:2007-09-22 00:27 UTC]
As I said, you do not have to hit `##M-*##' to match `foo'; it is enough to type `foo'. But it does not hurt to hit `##M-*##'. I'm sorry, but I cannot reproduce the problem. Perhaps someone else can, and perhaps either they or you can debug it a little. Here is what I see, with directories and files similar to what you describe:

  C-x C-f sub TAB

That shows:

  /home/sub/ [Sole prefix completion]

I type `S-TAB' to see the files in `sub'. This is not necessary; you can just type `foo', then `S-TAB' to complete it -- but this doesn't hurt. I then type `##M-*##', which is also unnecessary, but it does not hurt. I then see:

  Match also (regexp): /home/sub/

I type `foo' (you did not say when you typed `foo', BTW). I type `S-TAB' to complete it. I then see this:

  /home/sub/the_file_i_am_looking_for_but_dont_know_the_prefix_foo [Sole apropos completion]

The file name (non-directory part) is highlighted with face `icicle-complete-input'. I hit `RET', and it opens that file. I think that's just what you described (except I don't know when you typed `foo'), but before you hit `RET' you apparently see only this (no `sub'):

  /home/the_file_i_am_looking_for_but_dont_know_the_prefix_foo

Or do you see this (no directory at all)?

  the_file_i_am_looking_for_but_dont_know_the_prefix_foo

You should not see the latter, but it should still work, since the `default-directory' should be ##/home/sub/##.

Question: You did hit `S-TAB' after you typed `foo', right? Since there is only one match, `foo' itself will be highlighted with face `icicle-complete-input' to indicate that. If you then hit `RET' without first completing with `S-TAB', it will open a new file `foo' in directory ##/home/sub/##. But I understand that what happens is that it opens a new file `the_file_i_am_looking_for_but_dont_know_the_prefix_foo' in directory ##/home/## (not ##/home/sub/##).

Anyway, I cannot do more without more info from debugging. If you want to do that, you can try. Are you using the default '''Icicles''' bindings, so that `C-x C-f' is bound to `icicle-find-file'? If so, you can try `M-x debug-on-entry read-file-name' or `M-x debug-on-entry icicle-find-file-w-wildcards'. 
Before you do that, load files ##icicles-cmd.el## and ##icicles-fn.el##, then toggle ''Icicle'' mode off, then on -- that way, you're using the source definitions, not the byte-compiled definitions. If, instead, `C-x C-f' is bound to, say, `find-file', then debug either `read-file-name' or `find-file'.

Let us know your platform (GNU/Linux? UNIX?). Perhaps someone else can reproduce the problem. -- DrewAdams

[new]
Sorry for the mess up.... I did not notice your update ... my bad.  I updated my earlier response without seeing your reply

I am using Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) I think it is version 4.... the version of emacs is 21.3.1.

You asked "You did hit `S-TAB' after you typed `foo', right?"  Yes I did, and it returned the filename, but not the directory.   I think the problem only occurs when I use the `M-*' which you have indicated is redundant.  After trying it your way (without `M-TAB'), it seems to work fine.  I can still hit `S-TAB' to get a completion list and then just `f o o' `S-TAB' to get the desired results.

You wrote:

I then type `##M-*##', which is also unnecessary, but it does not hurt. I then see:

  Match also (regexp): /home/sub/

I get:

  Match also (regexp):

It is blank .... when I type `f o o' it flashes something like ... only 1 completion.  I then hit `S-TAB' and I get the_file_i_am_looking_for_but_dont_know_the_prefix_foo.  I hit `RET' and then I get my empty buffer.  If I do a `M-x pwd' I get /home
I tried it using emacs -q to ensure that it is not something else in my setup.  It is probably something to do with emacs 21.3 and sounds like it is fixed in emacs 22.  You can close the issue if you like.

Thanks for the outstanding support! -- IanPerryman

[new:DrewAdams:2007-09-22 06:33 UTC]
Got it! It's definitely a (great) '''Icicles''' bug in Emacs 20 and 21 (but not Emacs 22). Those Emacs versions don't allow a ##PREDICATE## argument for `read-file-name', so I must switch to `completing-read' for the subsequent (progressive) completions. 

The fix is that I need to tack on the directory. So in Emacs < 22, you will see the directory as part of each completion candidate (e.g. in `*Completions*', should you happen to hit `S-TAB' again) instead of in the minibuffer. This is not ideal, but it works. It is not ideal because it is not really file-name completion -- you can no longer change directories, for example, once you've used `##M-*##'.

You've learned a lesson about when to complete (`S-TAB') and when you don't need `##M-*##', and I learned about a great bug that's been there for a few months. Thanks! Please try the latest version of <tt>[[icicles-mcmd.el]]</tt>. Thanks for your patience and perseverance. -- DrewAdams

Just discovered Icy's C-` in shell mode. Neat! (M-r hurts..). Couple of issues though:

1) It seems to work by scanning the current buffer for shell prompts, which results in all the entries in the `*Completions*' buffer having `[me@host ~]' (or whatever) prepended to them. I'm not sure this is useful. I think it's fine to highlight the full line of input, including the shell prompt, in the shell buffer itself, but the prompt should be stripped from the input lines when placed in the `*Completions*' buffer.

Here's a weird interaction that happens because of this: in directory `one', `echo foo'. In directory `two', `echo foo'. Now, try to complete on `foo'. It completes up to `[me@host ` because the two directories differ, but really they have nothing to do with the command being completed.

2) The `*Completions*' buffer contains duplicate entries, one for each time you previously entered the same command. I don't think it's useful to choose between one of n identical entries. Can only one be shown?

Thanks -- AvgJoe

: Try also '''`C-c TAB'''' (`icicle-comint-command'). That is also an '''Icicles''' multi-command, and it has these advantages over `##C-`##' (`icicle-comint-search'):

** You can access all commands in `comint-input-ring', not just commands that are visible in the buffer. This means you can also access commands in previous sessions.
** The prompt is not part of the candidate. This should take care of your prompt problem. (BTW, `S-TAB' should nevertheless show you all matches for `foo', regardless of the prompt (directory).)

: On the other hand, `##C-`##' has this advantage over `C-c TAB':

** The prompt is part of the candidate ;-). This means, in particular, that you can use `C-RET', `C-mouse-2', etc. to repeat multiple previous commands, or repeat the same command multiple times, without exiting completion. When you use `C-RET' etc. with `C-c TAB', the chosen command is inserted multiple times at the same prompt (e.g. ###lslsls##), instead of being executed multiple times.

: By default, duplicates ''are'' removed. And you can toggle this behavior at any time during completion, using '''`##C-$##''''. Perhaps you previously toggled this and forgot about it? If not, if you find that the default behavior is without duplicate removal or you cannot toggle this, then let me know -- that would be a bug.

: Keep in mind that these '''Icicles''' commands are basically only proof-of-concept functions, to show that it is easy to use '''Icicles''' search in different ways etc. They don't pretend to offer a whole lot in the way of shell interaction functionality. I'm open to useful improvements, but I won't try to get into sophisticated prompt manipulation and stuff -- not worth it for me (but others can try).

When using icicles together with mumamo-mode
(see http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/MuMaMo) completion in function
"mumamo-set-chunk-family" only works partially. 
Upon selecting a completion candidate the error 
"Wrong type argument: listp, 1" is thrown.

The relevant debug output is:

<pre>
[...]
  signal(error ("Wrong type argument: listp, 1"))
  error("%s" "Wrong type argument: listp, 1")
  (condition-case act-on-choice 
(let (...) (setq icicle-candidate-action-fn nil) 
(funcall ... cmd-choice)) 
(quit (icicle-try-switch-buffer orig-buff) (setq last-command last-cmd))
(error (icicle-try-switch-buffer orig-buff) (setq last-command last-cmd) 
(error "%s" ...)))
  (let* ((orig-buff ...) (orig-window ...) (last-cmd last-command)
(icicle-candidate-action-fn ...)) nil 
(condition-case act-on-choice (let ... ... ...) (quit ... ...) (error ... ... ...))
 (setq last-command last-cmd))
  icicle-execute-extended-command()
  call-interactively(icicle-execute-extended-command)
[...]
</pre>

To reproduce:

1. Install mumamo-mode and start it:
   e.g.:
   (load "../../EmacsW32/nxml/autostart.el")
   (mumamo-global-mode 'nil)

2. M-x mumamo-set-chunk-family

3. Select any candidate (in my case, I just hit <Tab>
   to accept default choice, i.e. "nXhtml Family")

4. Hit enter: "Wrong type argument: listp, 1"

Without icicles active, no error appears.  31.05.2007 - ClausKlingberg

# Try with the latest version of '''Icicles'''. If that doesn't solve the problem, continue.
# Identify your Emacs version.
# Explain how to download and install the necessary mumamo and nxhtml files.

What happens if you do `M-x debug-on-entry completing-read'? What are the arguments to `completing-read', particularly the second argument, ##TABLE##? I suspect that the ##TABLE## argument to `completing-read' might be the problem. If so, I will need to know what form it has (alist, function, etc.) and, if it is an alist, what a typical element in the list looks like.

What happens if you set `icicle-bind-top-level-commands-flag' to `nil'? If you don't see the problem, then you can do that as a workaround. You can also just bind `M-x' to `execute-extended-command', which is less drastic.

If you tell me clearly how to obtain and install the necessary libraries, without also installing Emacs (e.g. [[EmacsW32]]), then I will try to take a look. Thx -- DrewAdams

[new:ClausKlingberg:2007-06-01 13:23 UTC]
Drew,

let me provide you with some more information (see below) - if
that's not sufficient, here's how to download nxhtml-mode:

Latest version of nxhtml-mode (including mumamo-mode) can be downloaded
here: http://ourcomments.org/cgi-bin/emacsw32-dl-latest.pl (see link to zip-file near bottom of page) Installation is described in README file (nothing special from other
packages). I'm using v1.03 of nxhtml-mode as of 25/05/2007 with GNU Emacs 22.0.99.1
(i386-mingw-nt5.1.2600) of 2007-04-24

Icicles-mode is up to date (01/06/2007)

Now for some debug info:

I suspect the critical code is starting here, at function completing-read
(from mumamo.el):

<pre>
[...]
      (define-key minibuffer-local-must-match-map [up] up-fun)
      (define-key minibuffer-local-must-match-map [down] down-fun)
      (save-window-excursion
        (mumamo-describe-chunk-family default-name)
        (completing-read prompt
                         mumamo-chunk-family-list
                         nil ; predicate
                         t   ; require-match
                         default-name ;; initial-input
                         (cons 'hist histpos) ;; hist
                         )))))
  (when (= 0 (length chunk-family-name))
    (error "No chunk family given"))
[...]
</pre>

Since you mentioned the table-variable might be the culprit. From the
definition of 'mumamo-chunk-family-list' (an alist type variable):

C-h-v 'mumamo-chunk-family-list'

<pre>
[...]
The entries in this list has the format

  (CHUNKS-DEF-NAME MAJOR-MODE SUBMODE-CHUNK-FUNCTIONS)

CHUNKS-DEF-NAME is the key name by which the entry is recognized.
MAJOR-MODE is the main major mode used by this entry.
SUBMODE-CHUNK-FUNCTIONS is a list of the functions that does the
chunk division of the buffer.

[...]

Value:
(("nXhtml Family" nxhtml-mode
  (mumamo-chunk-xml-pi mumamo-chunk-inlined-style
   mumamo-chunk-inlined-script mumamo-chunk-style mumamo-chunk-onjs=))
 ("HTML Family" html-mode
  (mumamo-chunk-xml-pi mumamo-chunk-inlined-style
   mumamo-chunk-inlined-script mumamo-chunk-style mumamo-chunk-onjs=))
[...]
</pre>

BTW: Setting ‘icicle-bind-top-level-commands-flag’ to ‘nil’ makes no difference. HTH, ClausKlingberg

[new:DrewAdams:2007-06-01 13:33 UTC]
Thanks for the info, Claus. Very interesting problem.
Yes, this is an '''Icicles''' bug, and I'm not sure of the best way to fix it. I've posted a message to the Emacs developer's list with a question about it. I've also provided a quick-and-dirty fix, for now -- please try the latest version and let me know.

The problem is a name capture between the ##HIST## parameter of `icicle-completing-read' (to which `completing-read' is aliased when you are in ''Icicle'' mode). Mumamo passed ##(hist . 1)##, and `hist' is also the name of the parameter of `icicle-completing-read'. Although `hist' in ##(hist . 1)## was meant to refer to a global variable `hist', the name was captured by the parameter `hist', and the value was therefore ##(hist . 1)##!

No matter what I name that parameter, say `##jk$lj*&##' instead of `hist', if you (or Mumamo or whoever) pass an arg that refers to that name, say ##(jk$lj*& . 1)##, then `minibuffer-history-variable' picks up that value, ##(jk$lj*& . 1)##, instead of the value of `##jk$lj*&##'.

The only clean way around this that I can think of is to use a macro instead of a function, but that is unacceptable, because I need to alias `completing-read' to it. I need to have all code that calls `completing-read' pick up the '''Icicles''' definition. 

For now, I've used an ugly hack to fix this for 99.99999999% of the cases: just using a weird parameter name (e.g. `##jk$lj*&##').  If I hear of a better solution from someone on the emacs-devel list then I'll do that.

BTW, you also have another reported bug at [[#StaleIssues]] below. I marked it as stale because I never heard back from you. That too is about nxhtml. Please take a look. -- DrewAdams

[new:ClausKlingberg:2007-06-04 10:52 UTC]

Thanks for looking into this. Seems like a tricky issue not easily resolved. However, I can confirm your workaround fixes things for now; (which makes me happy since I became to rely heavily on Icy + nxhtml).

: Please provide a complete recipe to reproduce the problem, starting with ##emacs -Q##. Otherwise, I cannot follow. I don't know what you did, or when.

: You might want to do this, to help track down what's happening: 

## Load ##icicles-cmd.el##, even if you've already loaded '''Icicles'''.
## ##M-: (define-key icicle-mode-map "\M-x" 'execute-extended-command)## -- This makes debugging errors easier.
## ##M-x set-variable debug-on-error t##
## Do whatever you did to provoke the error.

: I don't have much hope that I will be able to fix this for you. Emacs 23 uses Unicode, and AFAIK, it changes stuff that has to do with keymaps quite a bit. The '''Icicles''' code that provides key completion works with the keymap features and functions of Emacs 22. This is a pretty hairy area, and I have no Emacs 23 source code (and don't have the time to investigate it).

: As a workaround, you can forego key completion, by changing ##(when (fboundp 'map-keymap)## just before the `defvar' for `icicle-complete-keys-alist' to ##(when (= emacs-major-version 22)##. That will at least get you up and running, without key completion. 

: When Emacs 23 comes out, replacing 22, I'll take a look at the key-completion code and try to fix it to work with Emacs 23. If that's not feasible, then I'll pull it out. That would be a shame, but I have no confidence that Emacs 23 will be amenable to key completion in the way the Emacs 22 is. We'll see...

I tried the above to get extra debuging info but it didn't seem to make any difference. Same error message, no backtrace, nothing extra in *Messages*.

Anyway, for clarity, here are the steps to reproduce. On startup, switch to the *Messages* buffer by typing Mes S-TAB. Works. In a *shell* buffer, try TAB completion. Works. In that same *shell* buffer, then try apropos S-TAB completion. Fails with above error messages. i.e., it only seems to affect apropos on files.

I tried your suggested change re: fboundp map-keymap, but seems to just dissable apropos completion all together, which isn't a step forward.

While byte compiling, I did get these messages which seem related to the unicode stuff:

icicles-cmd.el:4087:32:Warning: `char-valid-p' is an obsolete function (as of
    Emacs 23.1); use `characterp' instead.
icicles-cmd.el:3941:35:Warning: `generic-char-p' is an obsolete function (as
    of Emacs 23.1); Generic characters no longer exist

In end of data:
icicles-cmd.el:4202:1:Warning: the following functions are not known to be defined:
    icicle-kmacro-action, dired-get-file-for-visit,
    diredp-find-a-file, diredp-find-a-file-other-window,
    synonyms-ensure-synonyms-read-from-cache, apropos-function

It looks at least like characterp is available in emacs 22.

I can obvioulsy appreciate that you don't want to be working on a version of emacs beyond the one which hasn't even been released yet. I just wanted to mention that emacs 23 is the only one available where the fonts are antialiased, and therefore more people are using it than would otherwise. Packages for v23 are available for Linux distros, for example, where there's no packages for v22.

Oh yeah. This is a new bug for me, I just updated icicles (same version of emacs). I would guess the last version of iciles was from about a month ago, if that helps.

Thanks for looking Drew! -- ppp-80-47-127-162.lns.access.uk.tiscali.com 

[new:DrewAdams:2007-03-28 15:49 UTC]
: I'm sorry, but I just don't have the time or resources to try to track this down. Here is what I can offer, in hopes it helps somewhat. 

## You should have gotten a backtrace if you set `debug-on-error' to `t'. Check its value and check the binding of `M-x'. 

## I suspect you're confused about `S-TAB', but there could also be a bug. Please be clear about what you did in the shell buffer. It sounds like you were not using minibuffer completion, but were just using `TAB' and `S-TAB' at the top level. I say that because 1) you didn't say what you did, 2) `S-TAB' at top level does key completion, which is what calls `##icicle-add-key+cmd##', and 3) you say that adding `fboundp' for `map-keymap' disabled "apropos completion". `S-TAB' as apropos completion is completely independent from its use for key completion; for apropos completion, it is a minibuffer binding, not a top-level binding, and it takes effect only during minibuffer (i.e. input) completion. I've added the ##(fboundp 'map-keymap)##, so you need not do that. It should not affect (apropos) minibuffer completion at all; it should only disable key completion, that is, use of `S-TAB' at top level.

## Don't worry about the byte-compile warnings. However, the first ones you mention do indicate that Emacs 23 has changed considerably wrt the stuff I use for key completion, which was written only a couple of months ago. FWIW, the calls to `char-valid-p' and `generic-char-p' were suggested by the main Emacs developer of Emacs 23! I suspect they changed that after some discussion I had with that developer about some problems I ran into.

## There is lots of stuff in Emacs 22 that is not yet in Emacs 23, and vice versa. The former leads to some of your byte-compiler warnings. I cannot support Emacs 23 now. If you can get some use from '''Icicles''' with Emacs 23, that's good, but if you cannot, I'm not sure how much help I can be. I'm available for questions, of course.

## That's too bad about the anti-aliasing. I know what you mean. I use Emacs mostly on MS Windows, and there Emacs is able to take advantage of Windows anti-aliasing (e.g. ClearType font smoothing). I notice that that works for Emacs 20 and 22, but not for Emacs 21, for some reason. If you are not on MS Windows, then I guess you're out of luck on that, and you'll need to stay with Emacs 23 to get anti-aliasing.

: Sorry I couldn't be more help. -- DrewAdams

: P.S. I added your IP as a signature for you, so I and readers can keep track of who reported what. Feel free to change it to a name of some sort.


[new:DrewAdams:2007-05-28 15:46 UTC]

The new completions display with multiple columns and shrink fit windows is really nice!  Here's something weird though:  If I split the windows M-x 3, and then in the left window activate some completion, such as switch-buffer and TAB, the right window shows the completions and both windows shrink fit to the contents of the buffer list (a couple of lines). The mini buffer now takes up the whole screen.  It all seems to go back to normal when the compltion is done.

However, when I try the same thing with some shell mode directory completion, it works if I do it within the right window pane, i.e. the layout is weird but it returns to normal when completion is done. But if I try initiating completion in the left window buffer, the completions are left active in the right window when the completion is done.

I'm not sure what I expect here. I guess it make sense to use the 'other' window temporarily for completions, but It may also make sense to use just the bottom half of the initiating window, or a wide, low window accross the whole frame (if that's possible). Ideally, everything should return to the state it was when completion is finnished. Thanks. -- ppp-80-47-127-162.lns.access.uk.tiscali.com

: I suspect that what you mean is that when you hit `RET', it opens a buffer named `cus'. If that is what you mean, then see above, where I say "Keep in mind...". If `C-x b' is bound to `icicle-buffer' or to `switch-to-buffer', then it uses lax completion, to enable you to type any buffer name you want (e.g. `cus') and open a new buffer. That means that when a sole completion is identified, you must complete your input (`cus'), using `S-TAB', to that sole completion (`test_customer.py'). Otherwise, when you hit `RET', your partial input (`cus') is taken as the name of a new buffer.

Is there a way to have commands executed from the minibuffer (and expanded by apropos completion) added to the command history. 
At the moment only commands expanded by standard prefix completion are added. Is this a bug or a feature (or maybe I just did
miss a configuration option?)?

I use the current icicles version and could verify this behaviour for emacs22 on windows nt and linux.  -- Jost

[new:DrewAdams:2007-01-20 16:42 UTC]
Thanks for the report, Jost. I don't see that bug. In both Emacs 20 and 22 on Windows XP, the command `forward-word' is available at the beginning of the command history after doing this (apropos completion):

 M-x for.*word S-TAB
 RET

That is no different from doing this (prefix completion):

 M-x forward-wor TAB
 RET

What is your binding of `M-x' (use `C-h k M-x')? Is it `icicle-execute-extended-command'? Do you see a difference in behavior if you customize `icicle-bind-top-level-commands-flag' to `nil' before loading '''Icicles''' and entering ''Icicle'' mode? If that option is `nil', then `M-x' is bound to the standard command `execute-extended-command', not to `icicle-execute-extended-command'. A difference in behavior could point to `icicle-execute-extended-command' as the culprit.

FWIW -- One thing to keep in mind: Don't confuse the use of input in the minibuffer via, say, `C-RET' during an '''Icicles''' multi-command with its final use as input. That is, if you don't finish a command with `RET' (or `S-RET'), then your input is not recorded in a history list. Command `icicle-execute-extended-command' (`M-x') is in fact a multi-command, so if you use, say, `C-RET' to execute `forward-word' and then use `C-g' instead of `RET' to end `M-x', `forward-word' is not added to the history. That is so, regardless of whether you use prefix or apropos completion. I doubt that this is what you are reporting, but I thought I'd mention it, just in case.

Please provide an exact recipe to reproduce the problem you see. Don't forget to mention how you access the command history (or provide the beginning of the value of `command-history'). Thx - DrewAdams

[new]
Hi Drew, 

thanks for your quick response. I did the following

  M-x foward-wo TAB  
  -> previous command is forward-word
  M-x kward-wo  S-TAB
  -> previous commands are backward-word forward-word
  M-x line S-TAB M-* beg S-TAB 

-> `beginning-of-line' executed and previous commands are still: `backward-word', `forward-word'.

O.K. the problem seem only to exist if i narrow the search down,
standard apropos-completion works the way you mentioned. Does this
give you a hint? It seems that `M-*' is hardwired to my fingers, that I
didn't notice its use earlier.

I did check the command history by using `M-x M-p' (multiple times) and then `C-g'. `list-command-history' shows all three
commands with arguments.

My standard binding for `M-x' was `icicles-execute-extended-command'. Using `execute-extended-command' (via
setting `icicle-bind-top-level-commands-flag' to nil) did make no
difference. -- Jost

Is there a way to speed up or just selectively load icicles? I probably only use about 10% of its combined power (minibuffer for commands and file expansion almost exclusively) and would prefer 10% of the load time:

From dope.el:

    [471.65ms for line 73 of file /Users/ryan/Bin/elisp/emacs.el at file-depth 0]
     (icicle-mode 1)
    [393.00ms for line 72 of file /Users/ryan/Bin/elisp/emacs.el at file-depth 0]
     (require (quote icicles))

-- RyanDavis

[new:DrewAdams:2007-01-09 23:07 UTC]
I don't think there is an easy way to reduce the initialization time. You can try tweaking things, or perhaps someone else has a suggestion. I don't plan to try packaging it in optional pieces (with the possible exception of <tt>[[icicles-cmd.el]]</tt>, some of which could be made optionally loadable).

Make sure you byte-compile the libraries, of course, or your load time will suffer (as well as the time to enable ''Icicle'' mode).

What version of Emacs do you use? If you use Emacs 22, then there is a significant hit each time you enable or disable ''Icicle'' mode. There's nothing I can do about that, AFAIK -- I've discussed it on ##emacs-devel@gnu.org##. At least I found a way to remap commands instead of substituting key definitions; the latter takes incredibly long in Emacs 22 for `self-insert-command' (there are 80 zillion things bound to it).

It also depends how you use Emacs. If you open Emacs often, a la ##vi##, or you enable and disable ''Icicle'' mode often, then yes, I can see how it would be bothersome. I load Emacs once a day, at the most, and I stay in ''Icicle'' mode. Less than a second to load '''Icicles''' and enable ''Icicle'' mode is not too much when you use it that way, IMO.

Sorry I don't have a good answer for you. As I say, perhaps someone else has a suggestion. -- DrewAdams

[new:DrewAdams:2007-01-13 20:40 UTC]
Not a bug ;-). Actually, the story is more interesting than that. I use `intern-soft', not `intern', so that I can privilege describing ''existing'' symbols. By using `intern-soft' I can avoid creating symbols that name buffers etc. Symbols are described in this priority order:

# those for which `icicle-candidate-help-fn' is defined
# those naming functions
# those naming variables
# those naming faces
# those with plists

However, I've improved the code, with your request in mind. Now, if an existing symbol is not found, one is created with that name, and it is described, so you should get the behavior you wanted. 

Also, I've added description of file names, and I describe buffer and file candidates whether the candidate is a symbol or a string. If a buffer is visiting a file, the buffer is described; otherwise, the file is described.
You might want to bind the new command for describing a file to some key. Library <tt>[[setup-keys.el]]</tt> uses `C-h M-f'. 

There is currently an Emacs 22 bug (which I've reported) that the code tries to work around. However, the workaround is not 100%: The file of the current buffer gets described, not the buffer itself. That minor problem will go away when the Emacs bug is fixed. 

As always, thanks for your feedback. -- DrewAdams

I'll need some more information to find this problem. Please give me a specific recipe, starting with ##emacs -q --no-site-file##. I can use prefix completion with command names that start with numerals (e.g. `1on1-emacs') with no problem. Also, I find no occurrence of `completion-run-if-within-overlay' or `completion-use-hotkeys' in either the '''Icicles''' code or the vanilla GNU Emacs Lisp or C code. So, I suspect that maybe something else you are loading is causing this problem, not '''Icicles'''. What Emacs version are you running? Are you running a recent version of '''Icicles'''? 

I even tried googling for `completion-use-hot-keys', but couldn't find it anywhere. However, I was able to locate `completion-run-if-with-overlay' -- it is in TobyCubitt's PredictiveMode/CompletionUI code (Lisp:completion-ui.el).

So, the first step is to try to reproduce the problem with '''Icicles''' alone, starting with ##emacs -q --no-site-file##. I'm pretty confident you won't reproduce it. It's entirely possible that PredictiveMode/CompletionUI and '''Icicles''' don't play too well together. However, I believe that TobyCubitt himself uses '''Icicles''', so you might want to contact him about this problem. He is likely to know more than I about how to use the two together. After that, I'll be glad to try to help, if I can. Thx -- DrewAdams

This should now be fixed. Let me know if it's not.

FYI -- TobyCubitt pointed out that he binds anonymous functions to characters in the minibuffer completion maps. '''Icicles''' tests `last-command' and `this-command' symbols in various places, to see if the command was a cycling command, a completing command etc. Of course, an anonymous function is not a symbol, so ##(get last-command 'icicle-cycling-command)## was raising an error. 

It turns out that there is some vanilla EmacsLisp code that makes the same assumption that '''Icicles''' made that the last command was a named command. I'll report that to Emacs development, so those bugs get fixed too. Thx! -- DrewAdams

I usually have two or more windows open in a frame.  When I quit the `*Completions*' buffer, it kills my window, even if it wasn't what created it.

[new:DrewAdams:2006-08-26 22:57 UTC]
I'll try to help, but you'll need to give me some more information. What version of Emacs? Do you have the latest version of '''Icicles'''? I think you're saying that you use completion, and then end completion (using `C-g' or `RET'?), and one of the windows (which one?) you had open originally disappears (so you only have one window in the end). Is that right? What do you mean by "it wasn't what created it" -- what created what?

I wasn't able to reproduce your problem (if I understand it correctly). Can you give me an exact recipe to reproduce this, starting with ##emacs -q##, and specifying which window is selected when you use completion, how you "quit the `*Completions*' buffer", and which window disappears?

I don't see the connection with BrowseKillRing; perhaps if you explain that, it will help also. BrowseKillRing does not use completion, AFAIK.

BrowseKillRing is only relevant insofar as it has graceful handling of window behavior.  It pops things up in other windows, and when I get rid of it, it only kills them if it created the window itself.  Icicles seems to assume that it created the window that *Completions* is displayed in, and when I dismiss it, it wipes out the window.

To fix it, I just rebound C-x k to the normal kill-buffer command. -- saccade


[new:DrewAdams:2006-08-27 17:15 UTC]
Hmm. Well, I've uploaded a change that I think will take care of this when you use `q' in `*Completions*'. However, this "fix" is a bit against my better judgement, to be honest. 

Also, if you use `icicle-kill-buffer' to kill `*Completions*', instead of using `q', then you will see the same behavior as before. This behavior is normal, IMO: the `*Completions*' window should be removed when completion is finished. Plain `kill-buffer' does not use `completing-read', so it does not remove the `*Completions*' window; `icicle-kill-buffer' does use ('''Icicles''') `completing-read', so it does remove the `*Completions*' window. I see no reason why ending completion should not remove the `*Completions*' window (as you say, it was created and displayed by '''Icicles''' in this case).

I think the real issue is perhaps this: `*Completions*' might not always be displayed in a new window; instead, depending on your setup, it can perhaps sometimes reuse an existing window. In my own setup (OneOnOneEmacs), it always uses a new window (a separate frame, in fact), so it always makes sense to delete that window afterward. I can, if needed, ensure that `*Completions*' is always displayed in a new window, but I'm not sure that would be appreciated by everyone. Currently, I just use `with-output-to-temp-buffer' to display it. I don't bother using `temp-buffer-show-function' to ensure that a new window is created for the display.

I'm curious as to what your use case really is. What you described seems like a strange way to work (nothing wrong with strange ways of working; that's what led to things such as '''Icicles'''!). I understand that the recipe was just to reproduce the bug, but I wonder what you were actually doing (trying to do) that led you to do this. I'm curious, in particular, why anyone would switch to buffer `*Completions*' outside the context of completion, and then not want the `*Completions*' window to be removed when its buffer is killed.

Please let me know how you were working, so I can understand your use case. In my thinking (so far), `*Completions*' is tied to completion, and I always want to remove its window when completion is finished.

It's possible that I won't want to change '''Icicles''' to accomodate your use case, depending on what it is, but please let me know about it. And let me know if the `q' fix works for you, at least.

Thx for the bug report. -- DrewAdams

So, here is the workstyle that leads to this issue.  I have a bunch of desktops, about 4 or 5 of which normally have an emacs frame open filling the entire desktop.  The frame is subdivided into three or four columns, each of which is divided into one to three rows.  These contain things like chat, dired, the buffer list, gud, interpreters, notes, the kill ring, todo lists, and of course code.  I do this because this way emacs can make sure that nothing is partially overlapping anything else, which is a pet peeve of mine.  (Unsuprisingly I also have an absurdly pimped-out balance-windows function.)  Something I have in my mind basically all the time is what stuff is in what part of the screen on what desktop.  The fact that you develop this on OneOnOneEmacs explains a lot -- as an experiment I tried using Icicles with a bunch of frames rather than a bunch of windows, and sure enough, if I use it that way everything is totally copacetic.  Unfortunately, this would require me to change my entire MO.

I suggest that as an experiment, you try using a bunch of windows for a little while where you might use a bunch of frames, both with and without Icicles.  You'll probably notice that when you turn on Icicles, when you're using its capabilities (in find-file, extended-command, etc.) the contents and configuration of the windows start rearranging themselves rather unpredictably.  This is why I kept quitting the Completions buffer -- it kept showing up where I didn't expect it.  Whatever you did seems to have partially ameliorated the problem -- I turned icicles back on, and have been working with it for the past half-hour or so, and for whatever reason it's better behaved since the update.  Now the windows only unexpectedly rearrange themselves temporarily -- when I'm done using Icicles they've been going back to normal.

Thanks for the clear explanation. I don't have the time now to look into this, but when I do, I will. Probably what I'll do first is make `*Completions*' always open in a new window, instead of reusing an existing window. IIUC, that might take care of the problem.

FWIW, I suspect that there are many more people using Emacs the way you do (maximized frame(s) with multiple windows) than the way I do (OneOnOneEmacs). Thx -- DrewAdams

[new:DrewAdams:2006-09-02 20:17 UTC]
I'm sorry to say that I looked into this, but I don't see an easy way to change the behavior so that it DTRT in all contexts. I did spend some time on this, but it's not obvious to me. If you experiment and discover a good tweak, I'm open to looking at it.

Also, if you can debug a little, to determine more about the window rearrangement you mention, then I can look at that a little more. As it stands now, it's not clear to me what happens -- I haven't seen it.

I'm curious about one thing, also: Don't you see similar behavior with vanilla Emacs? `*Completions*' is displayed in an existing window (if you have more than one window), and that window is chosen unpredictably. When you quit completion, `*Completions*' disappears and is replaced by another buffer (generally the one that was last in that window). I don't see a difference in behavior, now, between '''Icicles''' and vanilla Emacs in this regard.

I did make some other changes (bug fixes), as a result of playing with '''Icicles''' in a maximized single frame (without non-`nil' `pop-up-frames'). In particular, I don't think `##icicle-help-on-(next|previous)-(apropos|prefix)-candidate##' and `##icicle-(next|previous)-(apropos|prefix)-candidate-action##' were working properly in that context before. 

I'm moving this to [[#ClosedIssues]], since I don't think there's more I can do with it now. -- DrewAdams

I tried the newest icicles, because I'm interested in icicle-comint-search. I opened up a new shell buffer and tried it, but it gave a "no match for regexp" error. Seemingly this function only searches the comint inputs with a regexp in the current buffer. Since it's a new buffer there's no input yet in it. However in variable `comint-input-ring' (which holds the previous inputs) there are lots of entries. Shouldn't `icicle-comint-search' use this variable instead of relying on regexp search?

As a side note I had to debug a bit to find out the actual error message, since icicles bailed out with the error (using Emacs version 21.1.4.): "Not enough arguments for format string".

Hi Tamas; thanks for the bug report.
I've just uploaded a new version of <tt>[[icicles-mac.el]]</tt>, which should fix the problem of not seeing the original error message. Let me know.

The answer to the real question you raise is that `comint-input-ring' cannot be used in the definition of `icicle-comint-search'. That command is based on `icicle-search', which, as you said, searches the buffer contents. I've defined a different command, `icicle-comint-command', bound to `C-TAB' in `comint-mode', which should do what you expected. It's not very sophisticated, but it does let you use the complete history, beyond the current session. Please try the latest version of <tt>[[icicles-cmd.el]]</tt>.  -- DrewAdams

I use icicle-incremental-completion-flag `always' to always display a completions buffer, as I find it more effective than using icomplete.
One problem is that when set to always, typing a single character will immediately try to complete. The following makes the completion behaviour nice:

Hi, while trying to use <code>skeleton-read</code> in a skeleton with icicles running, emacs gives me the following error:

<code>if: Wrong number of arguments: #<subr read-from-minibuffer>, 8</code>

Turning off icicles makes the error go away.  You can replicate this by the following test code:

<pre>
(define-skeleton test-skel
  "Test skeleton"
  ""
  > (skeleton-read "Input ?") \n
  )

The same error happens when I try to use <code>customize-face</code>.

Thanks for the report. Should be OK now; please try the latest version. FYI -- This comes from our trying to keep up with the bleeding edge.

* Is there a way to switch off the rectangular frame with the help text "S-TAB, TAB: list, C-h: help" which appears in minibuffer after I press e.g. C-h v?  This rectangle both causes the minibuffer to change its height to about 1.5 lines height, and occupies more than half of the minibuffer so that the interesting information wraps into a second line after entering a few characters.

Thanks, Hans-Christoph

I think I'll like icicles apropos cycling very much, however, I can't get it to work. 

This is icicles.el update 17508 on Gnu emacs 21.4.1

To reproduce: Enter 'C-h v line' then press pgdown.  Expected: apropos search starts.

Happens: Minibuffer opens, showing 'Describe variable: ' followed by a rectangular area with some help information, followed by 'inline' where 'line' is underlined.  

But: everything from 'be variable:' until the right end of the mininbuffer is highlighted yellow.
Subsequent presses of pgdown give me 'Text is readonly' error message in minibuffer.  

Further info: when I use cursor down/up (prefix matching) this works as expected, even 'insert' to switch back and forth to the completion buffer and navigate there, etc.

Even more info: apropos icicling after M-x works as expected. -- Hans-Christoph

I'm finding the `icicle-find-file' command very useful, but I've discovered another small problem with it. With the normal `find-file', if I enter a directory name and hit `Ret', that directory is opened in a dired buffer. If I do the same with `icicle-find-file', nothing happens. --TobyCubitt

[new:DrewAdams:2006-03-22 17:27 UTC]
Good point. I didn't notice this because I use Emacs 20 most of the time, and in Emacs 20 and Emacs 21 `find-file' acts the same way as what you saw with `icicle-find-file': it opens the file that you're in (in another window, if you use `find-file-other-window').

Please try the latest version. Closing this issue; feel free to reopen it if you see a problem with the fix.

FYI -- It turns out that this was a high-level fix that a user could make: `icicle-find-file' is defined with `icicle-define-file-command', which uses `read-file-name'. Function `read-file-name' uses the file that you're in, not the `default-directory' as the default value (what you get if you just hit `RET'). The fix was just to supply an explicit default value of `default-directory' to `icicle-define-file-command' in the definition of `icicle-find-file'. Standard Emacs command `find-file' does not have this "problem" in Emacs 22 because it does not use `read-file-name'. -- DrewAdams

Wow, thanks for '''`icicle-expand-input-to-common-match-flag''''! :) I turned it on and it works great. There is an issue with file name completion though. I cannot reproduce it right now, but if it is turned on and you go down a directory hierarchy by completing directories then the completed directories are sometimes duplicated (##lib/lib/##) after completion (using apropos completion of course).

[new:DrewAdams:2006-03-20 16:03 UTC]
Please try to be more specific, or I doubt if I can help. Let me know what you did to get the symptom, starting with ##emacs -q --no-site-file##. What '''Icicles''' options did you change, if any, besides `icicle-expand-input-to-common-match-flag'? What OS are you on? What version of Emacs?

I tried playing with directories and files, and tried setting `icicle-cycle-into-subdirs' to `t' (thinking perhaps that's what you meant by "go down a directory hierarchy"), but I could not reproduce the problem. Were you cycling candidates (##[next]##) or just using `S-TAB'? I'll need more info, and probably a clear recipe, if I'm to be able to help you on this. [P.S. I moved this to IciclesIssues.] Thx -- DrewAdams

[new]
Ok, here's a way to reproduce it starting with ##emacs -q --no-site-file## and setting `icicle-expand-input-to-common-match-flag' to ##t##:

* Change to the root directory: ##(find-file "/")##
* Try to open the directory ##/usr/local##: ##find-file##, type ##/usr/loc##, press `S-TAB'

Instead of ##/usr/local/## the completion will be ##/local/local/## if `icicle-expand-input-to-common-match-flag'  is enabled.

Yep. It seems to work fine now. Good job! :) I may post some further thoughts to icicles discussion about how I use icicles. Maybe you'll find some of them interesting.

BTW, you should think about making downloading icicles easier, so that it's not so cumbersome to get new releases. Currently I have to download all the libraries one by one. I'd like a single zip file instead containing all iciciles files which I could download and unzip. I assume you already have a script to post new releases to the wiki and doesn't do it by hand (at least that's what I would do). If so also creating a zip file and uploading it to the wiki should only be a couple of more lines in your release script.

pc-selection-mode redefines the standard movement keys (next-line -> next-line-nomark) and Icicles fails to recognize this, so the movement keys are not rebound properly for minibuffer completion. -- Anon

[new:DrewAdams:2006-03-17 15:19 UTC]
Your description is vague; I had to check the ##pc-select.el## code. Library ##pc-select.el## binds ##[down]## in the current global keymap to `next-line-nomark'. It also rebinds all of the other arrow keys, their Shift versions, Shift-Control versions, and Shift-Meta versions, plus ##[next]##, ##[prior]##, and lots of other keys.

Do you expect the '''Icicles''' code to examine all of the global bindings made by other libraries such as ##pc-select.el##, take them into account, and then restore them all when you leave ''Icicle'' mode? And account for all possible orders of loading those libraries?

That's not the way the real world works. I'm afraid you're going to have to become familiar with the various libraries you use, and deal with their various ways of binding keys.

The '''Icicles''' doc explains how '''Icicles''' deals with bindings. Armed with that knowledge, you can deal with your various other libraries as each requires -- only you know what libraries you use and in what order. 

In this case, I suspect that your problem ''might'' be solved by entering ''Icicle'' mode before PcSelectionMode. That will let '''Icicles''' pick up the standard Emacs global bindings, and '''Icicles''' doesn't change global bindings, so it should not affect PcSelectionMode (except in the minibuffer).

If I've misunderstood your problem, then you'll have to be more precise about it. As with all issues, please provide a clear recipe describing exactly what you do, starting from ##emacs -q --no-site-file##. Mention also the versions of Emacs and libraries you use, and your platform. -- DrewAdams

[new:DrewAdams:2006-03-17 16:52 UTC]
Emacs 21 and 22 have macro `define-minor-mode', which defines the minor-mode function so that it runs the mode hook. IOW, code that uses `define-minor-mode' does not need to explicitly run the hook. Try to use the hook. Closing this issue -- let me know if you actually run into a problem. -- DrewAdams

The ##icicle-find-file## multi-command doesn't seem to work properly. When I hit `C-RET' on a completion, instead of opening the file, a new file with that name gets created in my home directory. Same thing with `C-!' (only of course many new files get created instead of just one).

I assume the problem is that `icicle-find-file' only passes the filename part of the string to ##find-file##, not the full path, so  ##find-file## uses the default (home) directory, but I haven't had a chance to look at the Lisp code yet.

### Creation of buffers visiting the files, as expected.
### But no switching to any of the buffers.

:: The reason for #2 was that `switch-to-buffer' was trying to switch to the buffer in the minibuffer window (which is a no-no). The problem was that `C-RET' is executed from the minibuffer, and so, therefore, was the function passed to `icicle-define-file-command'.

:: I fixed the problem that I saw, I believe. I hope this has something to do with what you saw and that your problem is also fixed. Let me know -- DrewAdams


[new]
You're probably right about it just creating buffers, not files. But for me, the buffers were associated with new files in my home directory, and were therefore empty. It definitely didn't create buffers visiting the correct files. That's why I thought maybe only the filename without the path was being passed to `find-file'.

I'll try the new update and report back.

PS: Sorry for deleting that other reply last time! Completely unintentional.

[new]
Bad news. The latest version (22.0) has exactly the same problem as the old one: `C-Ret' or `C-!' from `icicles-find-file' open buffers associated with files in my home directory rather than buffers visiting the files they should.

Somewhere between the original version and this latest one, it sort of half worked. (Unfortunately I can't be more specific since I don't have that version lying around anymore. I seem to remember that `icicles-find-file' worked most of the time but prefix cycling was broken.)

File name autocompletion is broken. I'm using emacs 21.4.1 with icicles 19/08/2005.
icicle-cycle-into-subdirs-flag value is nil. For example when I try to autocomplete
<code>/site/e<tab></code> in the directory structure:
<pre>
  /site/
    /emacs/
    ...
</pre>
the already completed prefix changes to /etc. Also <code>/site/em<tab></code> doesn't find
any completion candidate. Etc. It seems as icicles is always trying to autocomplete from
root. Setting icicle-cycle-into-subdirs-flag to t doesn't help but instead brings a new
set of quirks into scene. The same applies to old-read-file-name, which works well
as read-file-name when icicles is not loaded, but as soon as I require icicles
becomes broken (with the behaviour described above) as old-read-file-name.

2. Can you try using the ''debugger'' to follow the execution path a bit. Load `<code>icicles.el</code>' (not `<code>icicles.elc</code>') before debugging. Debug whatever command you are using -- `icicle-prefix-complete', `icicle-next-prefix-candidate', etc. via `debug-on-entry'. As you step through the debugger in the relevant area, test variables `default-directory' and `icicles-default-directory' occasionally.

3. You might also try an older version of `<code>icicles.el</code>', prior to the fix that treats directories the same as files, for cycling. It could be that that fix reintroduced Carlos's problem. That is, try a version that is earlier than Revision 52 and later than Revision 32. The revisions are here: http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs?action=history;id=icicles.el.

If I get some more info on this, I'll follow up. For now, there's not much I can do with the info I have. You'll have to do some of the checking, on Mac OS. It might be something simple, but I have no way of knowing now. I've just verified that the current version works on Linux files and directories (via ange ftp from Windows). There's no reason this shouldn't be fixed for Mac users too!

If anyone else can help by checking the behavior on MacOS (and directly on Linux), I would appreciate it, as well.

Thanks -- DrewAdams, 2005-09-19

: [BTW -- You mention that you downloaded "all the code on which [Icicles] depends". '''<tt>[[icicles.el]]</tt>''' does not depend on any other code. The `require's in '''<tt>[[icicles.el]]</tt>''' are all soft requires, which means that you do not really need them. You need only standard library `<code>cl.el</code>', and that is needed only for byte-compiling.]

I had the problem with emacs-21.4 on a Linux system (Gentoo) using icicles.el revision 67.

I am not quite sure about the purpose of the (if...) that I have deleted. It would seem to remove all the path apart from the last name component of the filename if the name starts with a "/".  It seems on Linux for an example file "~/home/myname/incomplete_now_complete": that the first time I TAB complete I have "~/path/incomplete" completed to "/home/myname/path/incomplete_now_complete". Then hitting TAB again the leading "/" is picked up and the if statment becomes true so that I loose "/home/myname/path" and get (concat "/" "incomplete_now_complete"). Hope this helps.... -- MartinReed , 2005-10-05

[new:DrewAdams:2005-10-05 15:42 UTC]
Thanks for the report, Martin.

Your report helped. Yes, that is vestigial cruft code that was there before my general fix to this problem. I had removed 95% of it, but I had left this part because I wasn't sure whether it was still needed, and things seemed to work OK (on MS Windows) without it.

I've now removed that cruft. The same silly test existed in both functions `icicle-prefix-complete' and `icicle-apropos-complete-1'. Things seem to still work OK on Windows now (nothing broken), so let's give it a try. I'd be grateful if someone would test this on Linux, to see if the problem still exists.

BTW -- I don't know what you mean by revision '''67''' of '''Icicles'''. There is a `Version' number in the header, which is 22.0, which I don't change and which indicates more or less the version of Emacs current when I introduced the library (it doesn't mean much). And there is an `Update' number in the header, which truly indicates the revision of '''Icicles''' (my library '''<tt>[[header2.el]]</tt>''' updates this number each time I save the file after changing it). 

Thanks again! -- Drew

[new:MartinReed:2005-10-06 22:12 UTC]
Yes new "revision" works fine in Linux (Gentoo), Emacs 21.4.

Drew: you said "I don't know what you mean by revision '''67''' of Icicles". I was just following your revision description in your earlier response and using the "revisions" listed there as you said :" 3. You might also try an older version of `icicles.el', prior to the fix that treats directories the same as files, for cycling. It could be that that fix reintroduced Carlos's problem. That is, try a version that is earlier than Revision 52 and later than Revision 32. The revisions are here: http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs?action=history;id=icicles.el." (you might want to remove this last comment and your "BTW";-) )

BTW great library, I am starting to get into the other "icicle" family members as well - I wish they were packaged up with most of the common Emacs disributions....


[new:DrewAdams:2005-10-06 23:26 UTC]
''Great!'' Glad it finally seems to work on Linux.

Ah, sorry, I see what you mean about "revision" -- you meant Emacs-Wiki revision. In general, the `Update' number in the file itself is the best way to identify a given version.

I'm happy to see some people are trying out '''Icicles'''. Let me know of any ideas that come to you, at '''IciclesDiscussion'''. -- DrewAdams

icicles/icomplete+ 
Regexp search in history does not work - [No Match] is shown.

GNU Emacs 22.0.50.1 (i686-pc-cygwin, X toolkit, Xaw3d scroll bars) and
GNU Emacs 22.0.50.1 (i386-msvc-nt5.1.2600) of 2005-09-11

How to reproduce:
- .emacs with only icomplete+, icicles;

 M-x ve <ret> - ok, prints version;
 M-x ph <ret> - ok, prints phases-of-moon;
 M-x M-r mo <ret> - completes to phases-of-moon;

 <ret> - shows "M-x phases-of-moon [No Match]" in minibuffer;

The same way "M-x M-r" behaves when delsel.el loaded, but at least there is default delsel.el in <code>emacs/lisp/</code> which looks ok.
Sorry for putting it here, there is no discussion for icomplete+/delsel.

- Andrey - susuman_at_hotmail_dot_com

[new:DrewAdams:2005-09-30 15:57 UTC]
Thanks for the report. Please try the latest versions of '''<tt>;[[icicles.el]]</tt>''' and '''<tt>[[icomplete+.el]]</tt>'''.

The problem was in fact more important that what you described. It was not just that <code>[No match]</code> was displayed (inappropriately). In addition, you ''could not use <code><ret></code> to re-execute the command!'' The reason was that I was resetting `minibuffer-completion-table' to `nil', so no input was being recognized as a valid completion.

'''La Petite Histoire:''' Long, long ago (long before '''Icicles'''), I added code to '''<tt>[[icomplete+.el]]</tt>''' that resets the `minibuffer-completion-table' to `nil'. This was to prevent icompletion from displaying irrelevant stuff during input by `read-string', `read-from-minibuffer' etc., since completion (and icompletion) is not pertinent during those kinds of minibuffer input. 

Similarly, in the predecessor to '''Icicles''' (<code>elect-mbuf.el</code>), my definitions of `exit-minibuffer' and (the predecessor of) `icicle-abort-minibuffer-input' also reset `minibuffer-completion-table' to `nil', for the same reason.

I've now removed that legacy code designed to prevent inappropriate icompletion, and that fixes the problem you report. I suspect that Emacs has long ago fixed the icomplete display bugs that this code tried to work around, but I'm not sure. If not, I might need to revisit this later, to try some other way to prevent the inappropriate icomplete display.

Note that if you used the previous version of '''<tt>[[icomplete+.el]]</tt>''' and you also use any of my libraries that use `read-string', `read-from-minibuffer', or `read-no-blanks-input', you will ''need to re-`byte-compile' those libraries''.

Finally, I don't understand your last paragraph. What is the connection with delsel? Are you making a distinction there between my version of delsel ('''<tt>[[delsel.el]]</tt>''') and the standard version in <code>emacs/lisp/</code>? Sorry, I don't get your point here. Let me know if there is still a problem.

Thanks -- DrewAdams.

[new]
Thanks! That's exactly what I meant - could not execute
command after completion.

Concerning yours delsel, it turns out to be the same icomplete+ issue, you have fixed. delsel loads frame-cmds and frame-cmds loads icomlete+. I ran tests with clean dot-emacs but forget to clean site-lisp, so when entering pc-selection-mode, I had the same problem with minibuffer history. Renaming yours delsel.el helped and I thought it was a source of a problem too.

Now everything works fine.

Hi !

First of all: I like this "cycle everything the same way" idea very much but nevertheless I have a problem: If I try to open a file with C-x C-f and 'icicle-cycle-into-subdirs-flag' is 'nil' I have no subdirectory name completion. If 'icicle-cycle-into-subdirs-flag' is non-'nil' icicle starts to descend into the subdirs immediately as soon as it meets the first one with no return (it cycles in the deepest subdir forever). IMHO this is no meaningful behaviour. May it not be better to cycle in the current dir with name completion to all files and subdirs (like emacs or bash standard behaviour) ? Or is there a trick to work around ? 

Thanks to Drew Adams for icicle.el

icicles.el Update #: 6195 from Tue Sep 06 21:22:05 2005 - GNU Emacs 21.3.1

GNU Emacs 21.3.1 - General bug on all tested systems (minor priority): If I switch with [insert] into the "Completion" buffer the first four entries cannot be selected. In the "Completion" buffer cursor movement is only possible between the fifth (bug) and the last entry where icicles stops and doesn't cycle at all (maybe normal - it's not important to me). Cycling all entries in the minibuffer works fine.

[new:DrewAdams:2005-09-08 16:04 UTC]

Again, thanks for the feedback. I don't have much time right now, but it turned out that your `*Completions*' bug was a simple one to find and fix.

'''a.''' In `*Completions*', you should have seen this at the top of the buffer:

  Click <mouse-2> on a completion to select it.  (C-h: help)

  Possible completions are:
  <first entry here>                 <second entry here>
  <third entry here>                 <fourth entry here>

but you were seeing only this:

  Possible completions are:
  <first entry here>                 <second entry here>
  <third entry here>                 <fourth entry here>

The arrow keys that let you navigate among entries do not let you access the first three lines, which are heading text. Since your heading text was missing two lines, you couldn't access the first two lines of entries.

This problem -- not being able to access the first two lines of `*Completions*' entries usig the arrow keys -- arose from my trying to provide a workable `completion-setup-function' for different Emacs versions.  I still use Emacs 20, mostly, but I test with 20 and 22 -- I don't test with 21.  Function `completion-setup-function' changed between 20 and 22, and I assumed it changed between 20 and 21 -- so, I used the 22 version for 21 also.

Luckily, I have an old Emacs 21.3.1 I can test with, so I was able to find the problem. Please download the latest '''<tt>[[icicles.el]]</tt>''' and see if the problem is fixed.


'''b.''' It is "normal" (i.e., by design) that the `<code>[down]</code>' and `<code>[right]</code>' arrows do not move beyond the last entry (do not cycle back to the first entry). When you are navigating in `*Completions*', you are not cycling completion candidates. -- DrewAdams

[new:DrewAdams:2005-09-14 18:50 UTC]
I just fixed '''b'''. Using `right'/`left' (or `TAB'/`S-TAB') and `down'/`up' to navigate in `*Completions*' now wraps around.  -- DrewAdams

Some good and some bad news: The "Completion" buffer now lets me navigate all entries (and also the highlighting works now) but as soon as I select one of that entries there appears a "let*: Symbol's function definition is void: minubufferp" error. 

But before you get completely nuts: This is not so important to me. Cycling in the minibuffer works fine and everything else I have written to this page for the reason that people who have similar problems may have some hints how to work around. I do not expect icicles to be fixed until tomorrow morning. Emacs is a developers environment and not a "Push-the-Button" application. I have started to read the icicles source code and as soon as I have an idea how to help I will tell you. 

Don't be worried: it's not my interest to spread hacked versions of icicles and I surely will not do so but we just try to use Emacs as a developers environment for "Nyquist" (based on XLisp), a language for music composition and audio processing and icicles could be very useful as a kind of "unified users interface and help center" for all the involved lisp languages and dialects (cycling different lisp interpreters). :-)

[new:DrewAdams:2005-08-15 21:32 UTC]
Great bug description -- thanks. This is what comes from trying to create a library that works for multiple Emacs versions. And there is a coding lesson (moral) here...

I generally test in Emacs 20 and 22 (CVS, though not the latest), but not in Emacs 21 (pre 21.3.50). Knowing that `read-file-name' takes 6 args (max) in Emacs 22 (CVS), but 5 args (max) in Emacs 20, I used this:

 (if (boundp 'minibuffer-prompt-properties) ; If Emacs 22+, use predicate arg.
     (setq result (old-read-file-name icicle-prompt dir default-filename
                                      require-match initial-input predicate))
   (setq result (old-read-file-name icicle-prompt dir default-filename
                                    require-match initial-input)))

That works OK in Emacs 20 and 22, and testing with `boundp' is generally preferable to tests involving the version. (Also, in the actual code, I need to test for `<code>(boundp 'minibuffer-prompt-properties)</code>' anyway.)

''However'', the `boundp' was not specific to the code it protects (I cheated, figuring someone like MaDa would put me wise if there was a problem).

Here is the right way to do it:

 (condition-case nil                ; If Emacs 22+, use predicate arg.
   (setq result (old-read-file-name icicle-prompt dir default-filename
                                    require-match initial-input predicate))
  (wrong-number-of-arguments
    (setq result (old-read-file-name icicle-prompt dir default-filename
                                     require-match initial-input))))

Please download the new version and give it a try. Let me know if you there any problems.  Thanks -- DrewAdams

Icicles causes this error when I start Emacs in a terminal/console:

error: no such color: "unspecified-bg"

Only commenting out the appropriate lines helps:

 ;;  (require 'icicles)
 ;;  (require 'icicles-menu)
 ;;  (icicle-mode 1)

'''Icicles''' isn't intended for console mode. The problems for console mode are colors and key bindings. Console mode doesn't have bindings such as `S-TAB' and `C-RET'. If you rebind all commands bound to such unavailable bindings, and you use only available colors, you might be OK, but that's a lot of bindings! It really isn't intended for use in a console. <tt>[[icicles-menu.el]]</tt> might work in console mode, however; it is not really related to '''Icicles''', in spite of the name. -- DrewAdams

FWIW, I've become aware that some '''Icicles''' users do in fact use it in console mode, and some of those use it together with ViperMode. -- DrewAdams
