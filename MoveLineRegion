These, in combination with MoveLine and MoveRegion, provide behavior similar to Eclipse's Alt-Up/Down.  They use MoveLine if there is no active [[region]], MoveRegion if there is.  Note that unlike in Eclipse, the [[region]] will not expand to the beginning of the first line or the end of the last line.
