== About ==

The [[Git]] repository imports and extends the content of the
[[SVN repository]]. Unlike the subversion mirror it not only features
a branch containing all files hosted on the Emacswiki but also other
branches that only contain reasonable subsets thereof.

The mirror can be found at http://github.com/tarsius/emacswiki.  That
page also contains some additional usage information as well as a list
of planned features - so really you should be reading that instead of
this page.

== Branches ==

The following branches are useful for users:

* *about* -- contains a readme and metadata
* *master* -- contains the complete Emacswiki
  (same as the [[SVN repository]])
* *wikipages* -- contains most webpages
  (excluding homepages, news and obsolete stuff)
* *homepages* -- contains personal homepages
* *wikinews* -- contains news from the wiki
* *emacslisp* -- contains most Emacs Lisp files
* *libraries* -- contains actual Emacs Lisp libraries
* *snippets* -- contains Emacs Lisp files that don't qualify as libraries
