The EmacsWiki [[Git]] repository checks in every change on the Emacswiki (with username and summary being used as author and commit message). It contains the raw text of all Emacswiki pages, except for pages marked as deleted.

It uses [[Git]] and can be found [http://github.com/emacsmirror/emacswiki.org here] on github.

== Package Branches ==

Additionally individual packages distributed on the Emacswiki are available from this repository in separate _branches_ (named pkg/NAME). Such a branch contains the full history of all files that are part of a particular package but purges all other history. These branches can lag behind a few days.

_Most_ of these package branches are also available as individual _repositories_ from the [[Emacsmirror]] (http://github.com/emacsmirror/NAME), which is probably more convenient if you just need a few packages. 

Also, if you are already comfortable using git and need to make changes to a package which can't be merged right away, branch that package's repository from the Emacsmirror and hack away without having to worry about stepping on somebodies tows (as it can happen when you edit somebodies package here on the Emacswiki without prior approval). As always when you fork: don't forget to ask upstream to merge once you are satisfied with your changes!

== Technical Details ==

The master branch containing the full history of all pages and libraries since the 8th August 2009. The first 800 commits have been created by importing from the [[SVN_repository]]. Each of these commits contains all changes of a complete day and have no meaningful commit messages.

Since the 20th November 2011 this repository is integrated with Oddmuse - every edit results in a separate commit. The announcement can be found [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/2011-11-04 here].

The package branches and repositories are created by JonasBernoulli as part of the Emacsmirror. While the EmacsWiki and the [[Emacsmirror]] are separate projects the [http://github.com/emacsmirror/emacswiki.org Emacswiki repository] can be considered part of both.

== Discussion ==

[new]
I have moved this conversation here from [[SVN_repository]] because git would be more appropriate to implement this and because the git repository is now also an official repository.

I personally don't think that it is _necessary_ to implement the below suggestion but do think it would be _nice to have_. But like Alex I don't feel like working on it.

My preference (if someone else implemented it) would be a switch to org-mode and something like the worg wiki (http://orgmode.org/worg/) but that would mean that all pages need to be converted to org-mode and support for editing through the webpage would have to be implemented.

In summary I don't think this likely to ever happen unless _you_ start working on it ;-)

Why not make this DVC be part of the "Save modification" process ?
This would help in making it a AppropriateMedia of choice instead of
the EmacsNewsgroups or EmacsMailingLists to discuss or to have
know-how content on this wiki. Why ? Because we could easily browse it
offline, edit it offline and commit our changes when online. This is
how ikiwiki wiki engine is working and it damned efficient. -- XavierMaillard

[new]
I agree with Xavier. I think it would be really nice to have instant local access to the wiki,
and I think at least I would be more efficient in contributing to the wiki. Is there anything we could help with to make this happen? -- JoakimVerona

At one time I had a job running that would update from SVN, and if people had made changes offline, it would edit the wiki pages, too. That was possible without having to switch the wiki backend from simple files to SVN. On the wiki where I tested it, nobody ever used it, so I disabled it again. There was also the question of usability. At the time the job would just commit changes back to the wiki, but loosing SVN username and loosing SVN commit messages (since the job only ran once every 24h).

The alternative would be to write a module for Oddmuse to switch the backend from simple files to SVN. I'm assuming that will be a tricky thing to do.

Yet another alternative would be to switch Emacs Wiki from Oddmuse to Ikiwiki or any other related wiki engine. In that case, however, somebody else would have to take over maintainership. If you volunteer to do that, I suggest you start with a copy of the wiki somewhere, migrate the data, and then we'll do the domain hand-over once everybody is convinced that the new wiki is cool.

The reason the emacswiki is alive and well is because of its splendid maintainership, I think, so anything making the current maintaner uncomfortable would be 
ruled out IMHO. Technology cant replace humans(yet).

I dont now anything about OddMuse, but I can have a look since I have basically the same problem with trac based wikis at work.

--JoakimVerona

[new]
Do you not like the first option? A sync every 24h, simple to implement but loosing some information on the way? I must confess I like that approach best because it promises running code at all times -- we will be able to improve it incrementally. -- Alex

[new]
A 24h svn sync would be fine by me I think. Ideally it would be more often, but the important thing is that it works, and that you can edit locally and upload changes that way.
When this basic support works, one could implement direct sync with filesystem hooks and svn hooks.
--JoakimVerona

[new]
The benefit of a wiki is, of course, that anybody can just write. Anybody who wants write access to SVN, however, needs to apply for it, the admin has to do something, and so on. I don't like it very much. Somebody else will have to work on this. -- AlexSchroeder
