The Git repository is run by JonasBernoulli and hosted on Github. It is an import of the [[SVN repository]] and contains the raw text of all wiki pages. A cron job updates the repository every 24h some time after the subversion repository has been updated. Clone it like this:

    git remote add origin git://github.com/tarsius/emacswiki.git -t master -m master
