The Git repository is run by JonasBernoulli and hosted on Github. It is an import of the [[SVN repository]] and contains the raw text of all wiki pages. A cron job updates the repository every 24h (or less often) some time after the subversion repository has been updated. Clone it like this:

    git clone git://github.com/emacsmirror/emacswiki.org.git

There's lots of non-ascii pages.  This moves them to another directory:

    mkdir OTHER
    mv `ls -1 | awk '$1>"z" {print $1}'` OTHER/

Yes I know. Because of that I am working on creating branches for subsets of all files, like e.g. libraries and wikipages. -- JonasBernoulli
