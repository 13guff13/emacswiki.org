== About ==

The [[Git]] repository imports and extends the content of the [[SVN repository]]. Unlike the subversion mirror it not only features a branch containing all files hosted on the Emacswiki but also other branches that only contain reasonable subsets thereof.

The mirror can be found at http://github.com/tarsius/emacswiki.

== Usage ==

To get a *complete* copy of the repository simply run:

    git clone git://github.com/tarsius/emacswiki.git

Or fetch individual branches only:

    mkdir <dir>
    cd <dir>
    git init
    git remote add origin git://github.com/tarsius/emacswiki.git -t <branch> -m <branch>
    git pull origin

== Branches ==

The following branches are useful for users:

* *about* -- contains a readme and metadata
* *master* -- contains the complete Emacswiki (same as the [[SVN repository]])
* *pages* -- contains most webpages (excluding homepages, news and obsolete stuff)
* *homepages* -- contains personal homepages
* *news* -- contains news
* *emacslisp* -- contains most Emacs Lisp files
* *libraries* -- contains actual Emacs Lisp libraries
* *snippets* -- contains Emacs Lisp files that don't qualify as libraries

*trim-1* and *trim-2* are just intermediate steps and should not be used. 

== Status ==

* The above branches have been created and will be synchronized regularly.
* TODO Create a branch for each library.
* TODO Each such branch should have it's own repository (on github?).
* TODO Generate metadata from libraries (like README).

Since the repository is still fresh and might contain some fundamental flaws I can not promise never to rebase. However I do not intend to keep it that way.
