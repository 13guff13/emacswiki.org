== About ==

The [[Git]] repository imports and extends the content of the
[[SVN repository]]. Unlike the subversion mirror it not only features
a branch containing all files hosted on the Emacswiki but also other
branches that only contain reasonable subsets thereof.

The mirror can be found at http://github.com/emacsmirror/emacswiki.

== Branches ==

The following branches exist:

* *master* -- contains the complete Emacswiki
  (same as the [[SVN repository]])
* *all-clean* -- like master but with cruft removed
* *all-pages* -- contains most webpages
* *all-elisp* -- contains most Emacs Lisp files
* *packages* -- contains actual Emacs Lisp packages
* *snippets* -- contains Emacs Lisp files that don't qualify as packages

More branches might be created in the future. For example it would
be very easy to create branches containing only [News wikinews] or
[CategoryHomepage homepages].  Other branches (e.g only English pages
or only pages describing packages) could also be created but this would
be more work.  As of now I do not see any use for such branches so I have
not created them yet -- please tell me about possible use cases.

== Packages ==

The [[Emacsmirror]] contains repositories for most packages distributed
on the EmacsWiki.
