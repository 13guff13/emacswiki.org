The Git repository is run by JonasBernoulli and hosted on Github. It is an import of the [[SVN repository]] and contains the raw text of all wiki pages. A cron job updates the repository every 24h some time after the subversion repository has been updated. Clone it like this:

    git clone git://github.com/emacsmirror/emacswiki.org.git

I got "fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git".

Yes, the instructions were incomplete, sorry about that.  Since there currently is only one branch, I changed the instructions to the simple case of cloning the complete repository. I also changed the default location of the repository but the old location will continue to work too. -- JonasBernoulli

There's lots of non-ascii pages.  This moves them to another directory:

    mkdir OTHER
    mv `ls -1 | awk '$1>"z" {print $1}'` OTHER/

Yes I know. Because of that I am working on creating branches for subsets of all files, like e.g. libraries and wikipages. However I do not have the time to complete this at the moment so for now this mirror is pretty boring. (But see the older revisions of this page for an idea what I am working on.) -- JonasBernoulli
