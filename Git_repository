== About ==

The [[Git]] repository mirrores the [[SVN repository]], it contains the
raw text of all Emacswiki pages.

It can be found at http://github.com/emacsmirror/emacswiki.org

== Packages ==

The [[Emacsmirror]] contains repositories for most packages distributed
on the EmacsWiki.

The code used to synchronize these repositories with edits on the
Emacswiki is being rewritten right now, so there won't be any updates in
the near futur.

== Branches ==

The repository used to feature branches that contained only subsets of
the files from the Emacswiki, like e.g. only web pages or Emacs lisp
files.

The code used to create these branches was to complicated and will
eventually be replaced.  But due to the lack of interest in these branches
I won't do this until I have more time.
