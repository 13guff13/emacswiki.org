The Git repository is run by JonasBernoulli and hosted on Github. It is an import of the [[SVN repository]] and contains the raw text of all wiki pages. A cron job updates the repository every 24h some time after the subversion repository has been updated. Clone it like this:

    git remote add origin git://github.com/tarsius/emacswiki.git -t master -m master

== Troubleshooting ==

I got "fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git".  This seems to work:

    mkdir emacswiki
    cd emacswiki
    git init
    git remote add origin git://github.com/tarsius/emacswiki.git -t master -m master
    git pull

There's lots of non-ascii pages.  This moves them to another directory:

    mkdir OTHER
    mv `ls -1 | awk '$1>"z" {print $1}'` OTHER/
