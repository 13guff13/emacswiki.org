A cron job copies the entire EmacsWiki setup to a machine that [[zeus]] is running,
producing the [[Rsync repository]]. Another cron job then uses that to check it all
into a *Git repository* run by JonasBernoulli.

To get a *complete* copy simply run:

    git clone git://github.com/tarsius/emacswiki.git

You can also browse the repository at:

* http://github.com/tarsius/emacswiki

Or fetch individual branches only:

    mkdir <dir>
    cd <dir>
    git init
    git remote add origin git://github.com/tarsius/emacswiki.git -t <branch> -m <branch>
    git pull origin

== Branches ==

The repository contains several branches (with completely separate history):

* master -- contains the files used to maintain the repository
* wiki -- contains the entire Emacswiki setup
* plain -- contains all pages converted to plain text
* pages -- contains most webpages converted to plain text (excluding deleted and redirected pages)
* elisp -- contains all Emacs Lisp files converted to plain text

/wiki/ is like the [[Rsync repository]] (but excludes backup files), /pages/ is like the [[SVN repository]], /elisp/ is like the [[CVS repository]] and /plain/ is like the SVN and CVS repositories combined.

Still dead as of 2009-08-14. Can we delete this page? --RyanDavis

Perhaps it was broken because the [[Rsync repository]] was broken.
I think it should be possible to get it started again. -- AlexSchroeder
