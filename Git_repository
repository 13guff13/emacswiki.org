[http://github.com/emacsmirror/emacswiki.org This] repository mirrors the
[[SVN repository]], it contains the raw text of all Emacswiki pages.  It uses
[[Git]] and can be found [http://github.com/emacsmirror/emacswiki.org here].

== Package Branches ==

Additionally individual packages distributed on the EmacsWiki are available
from the [[Emacsmirror]] - each in it's own _repository_.

These packages are also
[http://github.com/emacsmirror/emacswiki.org/branches available]
as individual _branches_ directly from the EmacsWiki mirror repository.

== Categorization ==

The EmacsWiki repository also contains a
[http://github.com/emacsmirror/emacswiki.org/tree/categorization branch],
which categorizes all pages on the EmacsWiki.

== Discussion ==

[new]
I've written [http://www.oddmuse.org/cgi-bin/oddmuse/Git_Extension a little extension]
to the wiki that will track additions, edits and deletions to a local git repository.
I also created a user called "kensanata" on github and uploaded my SSH key.
What next? The goal would be for me to push changes to your repository from the maintenance job, I guess.
