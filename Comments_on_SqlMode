I'm new to emacs.
When trying the sql-mysql, I got the error message as below:
Unable to locate SQL Program 'mysql'.

Appreciate your help :)

Emacs will use a command line client to communicate to the database. Do you have it installed and is it called `mysql'?

If it is, and it works from a terminal but not within Emacs, then you need to its directory to `exec-path'.
