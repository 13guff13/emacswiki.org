You can read man pages using <code>M-x man</code> (if you have man installed) or using <code>M-x woman</code> (if you don't).  See [[Manual:manual page]] for basic information.

<code>M-x man</code> can prepare man pages in the
background using the external man program, so it might be a bit nicer
to use when reading long man pages, or when the system is very slow.
On the other hand, the man page will pop up seconds later, and some
find that disturbing, too.  See WomanMode for the elisp-only
alternative.

The man program will use the <code>MANWIDTH</code> or <code>COLUMNS</code> environment variables
to determine how wide man pages are.  Emacs sets the <code>COLUMNS</code>
environment variable to the frame width, if neither is set.

    (setenv "MANWIDTH" "72")

= Completion =

There's no page name completion with <code>M-x man</code>, but [http://user42.tuxfamily.org/man-completion/index.html man-completion.el] or [[Iman]] are possibilities.  <code>man-completion.el</code> can notice a [[Perl]] module name at point for the default.

You can also try the following to press the completion from WoMan into service (getting filenames instead of page names as such, so possibly with subtle differences in pages found)

    (defadvice man (before my-woman-prompt activate)
      (interactive (progn
                     (require 'woman)
                     (list (woman-file-name nil)))))
