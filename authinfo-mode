Authinfo Mode is a mode to hide all but the current line of your ##~/.authinfo.gpg## file.

* [https://github.com/kensanata/emacs-setup/blob/master/config/authinfo-conf.el find it on GitHub]

Things I might want to add in the future:
* hide passwords even if we show the line
* provide a keybinding to copy invisible passwords
* add a timer to wipe the clipboard containing the password after 10s
