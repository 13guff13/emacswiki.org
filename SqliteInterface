EMACS and SQLITE as a rapid application development environment

item 3 at http://mysite.verizon.net/mbcladwell/

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My attempt to clean up and use Cladwell's SQLite code pointed
out some major flaws in it:

* It sprays temp buffers everywhere
* It can only "connect" to a single database
* It doesn't return all the rows in the result set

In the process of fixing it, I rewrote it and added more features.
It and a demo form using Emacs widgets can be found on 
[http://www.jasonfruit.com/page/emacs_sqlite_and_widgets this page of my website].
