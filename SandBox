This page is not to be confused with //sandbox.el// at
http://panix.com/~tehom/my-code/, which can be used to help check the
security of new elisp code.

This page is the place to '''try stuff'''. You can also use the
[http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/test Test Wiki] for testing.
If you need your own wiki, try the

'''Please make all edits here minor:''' check the box below the
editing field marked "This change is a minor edit."
