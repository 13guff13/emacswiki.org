I've used Emacs for a few years, mostly on Windows PCs, since the Lucid days.  I like to tinker with it, still trying to get the 'perfect' .emacs file ("it's the journey that counts..."), learn how to use all the great packages it has, and trying to learn elisp programming when I get time, and of course doing a little promoting of Emacs amongst the other computer users I work with.

I help co-administer the help-emacs-windows mailing list on gnu.org with David Vanderschel.
And I made the icons used in the Windows version of Emacs, and some made from Luis Fernandes' Emacs logo (but they're not in the distribution yet): <http://users.adelphia.net/~rob.davenport/gnuicons.html>
