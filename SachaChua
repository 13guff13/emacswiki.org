How I use Emacs

=== Planning ===

I used to use PlannerMode a lot. Then I switched my blog to Wordpress (http://sachachua.com) and started using Emacs Org + Toodledo for my task management. Now I use org2blog to post some entries from my Giant Org File of Awesomeness.

=== Communication ===

I use Gnus, the built-in mail/newsreader that slices, dices and juliennes. I compile CVS Gnus (http://www.gnus.org) every other day or so. Yes, it's dangerous, but it's also fun. It's fast, sleek, and feature-rich. I've got basic splitting set up to file my mail into separate groups neatly organized in a hierarchical tree that allows me to see at a glance how much mailing list messages I've received. I can use "c" to catch-up groups or even whole subtrees, mark threads as read or even uninteresting. Adaptive scoring means that I don't have to manually specify my reading preferences - gnus learns what I don't like to read, so that I don't have to read related messages next time unless I really want to. I've actually set it to score down all messages from hotmail or aol unless I like the author. ;) I elide mailing list identifiers so I don't see those [....] things, banners like the ads at the end of yahoogroups, really long signatures or To: headers. Gnus is _definitely_ a mail/newsreader for the netiquette-sensitive. :-) 

BbdbMode integrates well with Gnus, so I can easily bring up or create contact records for the people I receive mail from. I have Gnus automatically add notes for the people I know, and it's interesting to see what mailing lists people are subscribed to. I can add notes, check phone numbers, and even see when someone wrote me last. (Time to write a "Haven't heard from you in a while!" note...)

Speaking of mail... Reportmail notifies me when I receive messages. It briefly flashes the author and subject in the echo area, and leaves the author in the modeline. That way I am quickly alerted to the arrival of _interesting_ mail. :-) Emacspeak reads these announcements too, so I also get an audible alert.

Mail is a somewhat dangerous thing to experiment with, of course. :-) I had lost some outgoing mail due to masqmail silently failing if you specify the -f flag (evil!), but some debugging later turned up a message-sendmail-f-is-evil variable I could set to t. I have since then moved to postfix so that I could use + as an address separator, so I haven't needed that.

Ah, yes, text messaging. SMS is pretty big here in the Philippines. I am a lazy computer geek who would rather type than fish out my cellphone and start texting. Besides, I kinda like having all of my text messages stored on my laptop - search, store, reply, and even see threaded displays. :-)
I used to use gnokii, alamin, postfix, bbdb and gnus in order to have practically seamless SMS sending. :-) Here's how it works. I've set up alamin (a GSM-SMS gateway that can talk to a gnokii-supported phone) to poll my cellphone for incoming text messages and convert any such to e-mail messages from alamin+<SOMENUMBER>@localhost to sacha@localhost. I receive those messages in Gnus in my mail.text group, and BBDB steps in to fill in the name from my contact database thanks to (gnus-summary-line-format "%U%-40,40uB %S\n"), (bbdb/gnus-summary-prefer-bbdb-data t) and (bbdb/gnus-summary-prefer-real-names 'bbdb) in the group parameters. My reply is processed by postfix and piped through email2sms, a short Perl script I wrote that just invokes alamin's client program. Alamin queues the message and tries to resend it at regular intervals until it is finally sent. No more dealing with "Message failed." or lack of signal, _and_ I get a full record of all of my text messages, _and_ I can text while in class.. ;) Unfortunately, I don't have a serial port any more, and my phone is not Linux-friendly. Can't pull off this neat hack these days.

(I no longer send text messages from my computer. I'm in Canada now, and text messages are expensive!)

=== Taking notes ===

I keep all of my notes in plain text files. I find that typing on my laptop encourages me to keep more complete notes because I can type faster than I handwrite (and it's much less tiring!). AllOut makes it easy to keep my notes in outline mode. During classes, I practically transcribe what the teacher says, occasionally doing some basic outlining if the lesson has a recognizable structure. I review by going over my old notes, using the time to also organize it into some semblance of an outline. I'm moving to keeping all of my notes in PlannerMode, because then I can easily wikify it with EmacsWikiMode. That will also allow me to use PlannerMode to schedule tasks, remind me of assignments, and use EmacsWikiMode-style references to bbdb, gnus, and other modules.

(Update: Now using Org for my notes)

=== Internet relay chat ===

ERC! EmacsIRCClient forever. Well, not really forever, but I've tried quite a few Internet relay chat clients and I must say that ERC is really cool. erc-track lets me keep track of channels that have changed even though I've got my notes maximized, and since it's part of my editor I can easily cut/paste/navigate/tweak/do-funky-stuff. I hang out on OPN#emacs and Undernet#linuxhelp, and it's tons of fun.

Well, that's it for now, because I really have to be getting back to work.

== Messages ==

I'm not sure PlannerModeCommentary is better of with including the text.  It seems to be very slow from this side of the globe...  :D -- AlexSchroeder

Wow. Everywhere I look I can see your planner oh PlannerMode goddess :) --RinoMardo
