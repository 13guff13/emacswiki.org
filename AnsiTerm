This is a terminal emulator written in EmacsLisp.
Now you can run vi (or mutt! (see MuttInEmacs) (or Emacs! :))) in an Emacs buffer!

Use M-x ansi-term to start it.

Note that M-x ansi-term differs from M-x term: ansi-term will render colors, too.

Also note that ansi-term remaps your default C-x key to C-c.

In Emacs 22, try prefixing actions that aren't recognized by their standard key commands with C-x.  For example, M-x becomes C-x M-x.
