Libnotify notifications for [[rcirc]].

Source:

* Lisp:rcirc-notify.el

To install, put it in your LoadPath and add the following to your InitFile:

    (eval-after-load 'rcirc '(require 'rcirc-notify))

This library tries to use the following binaries to send the message:


; notify-send: Available in packages libnotify-bin on Ubuntu, for example
; growlnotify: Newer Mac OSX
; osascript: Older Mac OSX

== How do I change the message? ==

Redefine `my-rcirc-notify-message`. Use %s for where you want the name of the person calling your name to go.

== Strange notifications? ==

You might see a message saying "X is calling your name" but when you check your active rcirc buffers, you see nothing.
What happened?

I found the following to be useful:

{{{
(defun occur-irc (regexp)
  "Run `multi-occur' for all buffers in `rcirc-mode'."
  (interactive "sList lines matching regexp: ")
  (multi-occur (let (result)
		 (dolist (buf (buffer-list))
		   (with-current-buffer buf
		     (when (eq major-mode 'rcirc-mode)
		       (setq result (cons buf result)))))
		 result) regexp))
}}}

Use it to find X in all your rcirc buffers. I discovered what had happened: ##*** X MODE +oooo kensanata## -- aaaah! :)

== Windows ==

Install [http://www.growlforwindows.com/gfw/ Growl for Windows] and run ##Growl.exe## in order to start the server.

Register Emacs by running the following command from a shell, eg. from [[Eshell]]: ##"/Program Files (x86)/Growl for Windows/growlnotify.exe" /t:IRC /ai:http://www.emacswiki.org/pics/static/CarbonEmacsPackageIcon.png /a:Emacs /r:IRC /n:IRC foo##

Add the path to your ##exec-path##:

{{{
(add-to-list 'exec-path "C:/Program Files (x86)/Growl for Windows")
}}}

Test it by evaluating ##(my-page-me "foo")##.
