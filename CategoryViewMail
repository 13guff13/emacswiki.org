[::VM]
is a mail reader that runs inside GNU Emacs and XEmacs.  The name is the short form of "View Mail" and it is also occasionally referred to by its long name (e.g., in the title of this page).

VM is shipped with XEmacs but not with GNU Emacs. You can get the latest version (8.0.0 and up) at its official home: http://www.nongnu.org/viewmail/.  Version 7.19 is hosted at its old official home: http://www.wonderworks.com/vm/.

The code base and the latest pre-releases of VM can be browsed at https://launchpad.net/vm.

VM is very well documented. It comes with a fine set of info pages, and there are two EmacsNewsgroups dealing with VM. These pages attempt to distill some of the useful information from the other sources.
