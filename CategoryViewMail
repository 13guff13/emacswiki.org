[::VM]
is a mail reader that runs inside GNU Emacs and XEmacs.

VM is shipped with XEmacs but not with GNU Emacs. You can get the latest version (8.0.0 and up) at its official home: http://www.nongnu.org/viewmail/.  Version 7.19 is hosted at its old official home: http://www.wonderworks.com/vm/.

VM is very well documented. It comes with a fine set of info pages, and there are two EmacsNewsgroups dealing with VM. These pages attempt to distill some of the useful information from the other sources.
