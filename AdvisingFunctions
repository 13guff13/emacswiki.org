WikiTodo: Add basic advising help.

== When to Use Advice? ==

See AdviceVsHooks for a discussion of when to use advice. '''''Summary:''''' advice is good to have, but not necessarily good to follow all the time ;-).

== Advised hello world ==

 (defun foo()
   (interactive)
   (message "hello world"))

 ;; advice the foo function
 (defadvice foo(around advice-foo activate)
   (interactive)
   (message "hello advised world")
   (sit-for 1)
   ;; and here it calls the advised function
   ad-do-it)

 ;; now you can unadvise the advised function
 (ad-unadvise 'foo)

 ;; now it will correspond to the original definition
 (foo)



== Interactive functions ==

Maintaining interactive-p inside an advised function can be a pain.
For details on this, read up the comments etc. in advice.el.  Here's
an example from Le Wang on how to maintain interactive-p inside the
function definition of an advised function.

    (defun bar ()
      (interactive)
      (message "bar interactive: %s" (interactive-p))
      (sit-for 1))

    (defadvice bar (around advice-bar activate)
      (interactive)
      (if (interactive-p)
	  (progn
	    (message "advice-bar interactive: %s" (interactive-p))
	    (sit-for 1)
	    (call-interactively 'ad-Orig-bar))
	ad-do-it))
