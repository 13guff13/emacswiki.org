== Commentary ==
latex-math-preview.el has the following three main commands.

M-x `latex-math-preview-expression' previews mathematical expressions pointed
by cursor in LaTeX files or strings of selected region with transient-mark on.
The result of this command is shown as image in new buffer.

M-x `latex-math-preview-insert-symbol' displays the list of LaTeX symbols.
Selecting a LaTeX symbol from it, you can insert it.
Depending on whether cursor is in mathematical expression or not,
this commands choose the symbol list.
If you don't want to use the automatic selection,
alternatively you may use M-x `latex-math-preview-insert-mathematical-symbol'
and M-x `latex-math-preview-insert-text-symbol' for mathematical symbol
and normal text symbol, respectively.

M-x `latex-math-preview-save-image-file' make an image for the same object
as `latex-math-preview-expression' and save it as a file which is png or eps.
When making an image, this command may remove number of mathematical formulas.

Buffer local variable `latex-math-preview-usepackage-cache' has
the values of \usepackage for previewing.
If you want to reload this variable, you use
M-x `latex-math-preview-reload-usepackage'.

latex-math-preview.el is a modified version which is based on
tex-math-preview.el and has been created at July 2009.
This emacs lisp is made by reducing some features of tex-math-preview.el
and adjusting it to LaTeX files.
tex-math-preview.el is made by Kevin Ryde and 
has some features which latex-math-preview does not have.
Please see http://user42.tuxfamily.org/tex-math-preview/index.html
for details of tex-math-preview.el.

== Requirements ==
You need to install the following softwares.

* Emacs (version 22 or 23) on Linux or Meadow3 on Windows.
* dvipng
* dvips
* latex (or platex)

latex and dvipng is used for making preview image.
dvips is for making eps image and not for previewing.

== Install ==
Put latex-math-preview.el to your load-path of Emacs and
write the following code in ~/.emacs.el.

<pre>
(autoload 'latex-math-preview-expression "latex-math-preview" nil t)
(autoload 'latex-math-preview-insert-symbol "latex-math-preview" nil t)
(autoload 'latex-math-preview-save-image-file "latex-math-preview" nil t)
</pre>

Please set key bindings of TeX mode which you prefer if desired.

== Install for YaTeX ==
For YaTeX mode, in addition to above settings,
you may add the follwing to ~/.emacs.el if desired.

<pre>
(add-hook 'yatex-mode-hook
         '(lambda ()
         (YaTeX-define-key "p" 'latex-math-preview-expression)
         (YaTeX-define-key "\C-p" 'latex-math-preview-save-image-file)
         (YaTeX-define-key "j" 'latex-math-preview-insert-symbol)
         (YaTeX-define-key "\C-j" 'latex-math-preview-last-symbol-again)))
(setq latex-math-preview-in-math-mode-p-func 'YaTeX-in-math-mode-p)
</pre>

In particular case latex-math-preview-in-math-mode-p does not work well.
So you may use YaTeX-in-math-mode-p alternatively.

This setting almost binds latex-math-preview-expression to "C-c p",
latex-math-preview-save-image-file to "C-c C-p",
latex-math-preview-insert-symbol to "C-c j"
and latex-math-preview-last-symbol-again to "C-c C-j".

== Usage ==
=== latex-math-preview-expression ===
If you type "M-x latex-math-preview-expression" when cursor points to 
a mathematical expression, new buffer including an image is created.
In this buffer, you check the result of LaTeX mathematical
expression and type 'q' to exit the window.
Also, you can preview the strings of selected region 
if transient-mark is on (type "\C-@" twice).

In preview window, the following binded key is applicable.
* q: exit preview buffer
* Q: delete preview buffer
* j: scroll up
* k: scroll down

[[image:LaTeXMathPreviewScreenshot]]

=== latex-math-preview-insert-symbol ===
You can browse the list of LaTeX symbols if you execute 
"M-x latex-math-preview-insert-symbol".
Then you select the symbol by cursor which you want to insert and
may type RET to insert it.
When inserting symbols, you may look at the description of key map 
on the head of buffer.

When you open viewing buffer, if there is not image caches then
you want for a while until the program finish making images.
Also, you can make all image caches by
M-x `latex-math-preview-make-all-cache-images'.

C-u M-x `latex-math-preview-insert-symbol' asks you the page
that you want to open before preview buffer is created.
M-x `latex-math-preview-last-symbol-again' make you
insert the last inserted symbol.
Also, if you insert a symbol, not depending on the context, you can use
M-x `latex-math-preview-mathematical-symbol-datasets' or
M-x `latex-math-preview-insert-text-symbol'.

[[image:LaTeXMathPreviewInsertScreenshot]]

=== latex-math-preview-save-image-file ===
First, M-x `latex-math-preview-save-image-file' asks you abount path of
an outputted image. Then, you must input the path of which extention is
'png' or 'eps'. The program makes an image and you may get a desired one.

== Settings ==
=== Path of programs ===
latex-math-preview.el uses 'latex', 'dvipng' and 'dvips'.
So, if these programs are not in the load path of system or
you want to use the different programs from the default,
you need to change the following variables according to your system.

* latex-math-preview-latex-command
* latex-math-preview-command-dvipng
* latex-math-preview-command-dvips

For example,
<pre>
(setq latex-math-preview-latex-command "/usr/bin/platex")
(setq latex-math-preview-command-dvipng "/usr/bin/dvipng")
(setq latex-math-preview-command-dvips "/usr/bin/dvips")
</pre>

=== LaTeX template ===
latex-math-preview.el makes a temporary file and gets an image
by commands 'latex' and 'dvipng'.
The construction of a temporary latex file is the following.
<pre>
(part of `latex-math-preview-latex-template-header'
 the default value is the following)
\documentclass{article}
\pagestyle{empty}

(part of usepackages
 the values of \usepackage searched from current buffer or
 `latex-math-preview-latex-usepackage-for-not-tex-file')

\begin{document}
(some mathematical expressions)
\par
\end{document}
</pre>

If you can change the header in temporary latex files,
you should set the customized value to
`latex-math-preview-latex-template-header'.
latex-math-preview searches '\\usepackage' in current buffer and
uses its value when making images.
But when there is no '\\usepackage' strings, alternatively
`latex-math-preview-latex-usepackage-for-not-tex-file' is used.
So you can set a preferd value to
`latex-math-preview-latex-usepackage-for-not-tex-file'.
The following variables is prepared for making image files.
* `latex-math-preview-latex-make-png-file-template-header'
* `latex-math-preview-latex-make-eps-file-template-header'

=== Options of commands ===
The options of 'dvipng'  is set by `latex-math-preview-dvipng-option'
for previewing.
In particular, the color options of 'dvipng' is determined by
`latex-math-preview-image-foreground-color' and
`latex-math-preview-image-background-color', which define
the foreground and background colors of png images respectively.
If these variables are nil, these colors are the same as it of
 the default face.

The following variables of command options is prepared for
making image files.
* `latex-math-preview-dvipng-option-make-png-file'
* `latex-math-preview-dvips-option-make-eps-file'

=== Matching mathematical expression ===
When you make preview images, 
the default setting supports the following LaTeX mathematical
expressions for "M-x latex-math-preview-expression".

* $ ... $
* $$ ... $$
* \[ ... \]
* \begin{math} ... \end{math}
* \begin{displaymath} ... \end{displaymath}
* \begin{equation} ... \end{equation}
* \begin{gather} ... \end{gather}
* \begin{align} ... \end{align}
* \begin{alignat} ... \end{alignat}

If you want to preview other LaTeX mathematical expressions,
please customize the variable `latex-math-preview-match-expression'.

=== List of symbols for insertion ===
To change symbol set, you may customize the variable
`latex-math-preview-mathematical-symbol-datasets'.
If you always open the same inital page,
you set nil to `latex-math-preview-restore-last-page-of-symbol-list'
and string of initial page name to 
`latex-math-preview-initial-page-of-symbol-list'.

This program keep the created images as cache.
These images saved in `latex-math-preview-cache-directory-for-insertion'
of which default value is "~/.emacs.d/latex-math-preview-cache".
If you change the cache directory, please put the following code
in "~/.emacs.el".

<pre>
(setq latex-math-preview-cache-directory-for-insertion
      "cache directory in your system")
</pre>

== Extra data ==
You may extra data for insertion of LaTeX symbols.
The file is [Lisp:latex-math-preview-extra-data.el latex-math-preview-extra-data.el].
To use extra data, you put latex-math-preview-extra-data.el to load path and
require latex-math-preview.el and latex-math-preview-extra-data.el and 
write the following in ~/.emacs.el.

<pre>
(add-to-list 'latex-math-preview-text-symbol-datasets
	     latex-math-preview-textcomp-symbol-data)
(add-to-list 'latex-math-preview-text-symbol-datasets
	     latex-math-preview-pifont-zapf-dingbats-symbol-data)
(add-to-list 'latex-math-preview-text-symbol-datasets
	     latex-math-preview-pifont-symbol-fonts-symbol-data)
</pre>

== Discussion ==
[new]
Is it possible to write a native elisp MathML previewer (maybe using nXML) and a converter to convert TeX/LaTeX formulae to MathML? I think Emacs can benefit from a MathML preview package. - Leo

latex-math-preview makes png images of mathematical formulas by dvipng and display it in Emacs.
So if there is software which convert MathML to png file, previewing MathML is maybe possible in the way of latex-math-preview.
But because I have not used MathML yet, I don't know about MathML at all and think I will not implement the functions about MathML. - Yamaguchi
