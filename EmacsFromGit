A [[Git]] mirror of the [EmacsFromBazaar Emacs Bazaar repository] is available.
It seems to be [http://article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.devel/119614 semi-official].

<pre>
 git clone git://repo.or.cz/emacs.git
</pre>
or for those behind a proxy:
<pre>
 git clone http://repo.or.cz/r/emacs.git
</pre>

You can also browse the repository at http://repo.or.cz/w/emacs.git.

Mirrors of the above git repository exist on
[http://github.com/emacsmirror/emacs github] and
[http://gitorious.org/emacsmirror/emacs gitorious].
But be aware that these currently lag behind a bit.

Beware that this (by design) includes the entire history and therefore
weighs about 300MB.
