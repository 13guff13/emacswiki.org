A [[Git]] mirror of the [EmacsFromBazaar Emacs Bazaar repository] is available. <b>Note:</b> Only Bazaar repo is official!

<b>Note:</b> Seems that all Git mirrors are near one day old! Read [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.help/79267 discussion].

<b>Note:</b> <code>clone/pull</code> operations on Bazaar repo seems have same time, network efficient as Git when used <code>bzr://</code> or <code>nosmart+bzr://</code> protocols. <code>http://</code> protocols for Bazaar and for Git both are not efficient!

<b>Note:</b> Git repository includes the entire history of GNU Emacs development and therefore weighs about 300MB.

Official [http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/emacs Savannah Emacs page] reffer to git Emacs mirror intended for those who prefer to use git as their VCS:
<pre>
  $ git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs.git
</pre>

There are exist another [http://article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.devel/119614 semi-official] mirrors:

<pre>
 git clone git://repo.or.cz/emacs.git
</pre>
or for those behind a proxy:
<pre>
 git clone http://repo.or.cz/r/emacs.git
</pre>

You can also browse the repository at http://repo.or.cz/w/emacs.git.

Mirrors of the above git repository exist on
[http://github.com/emacsmirror/emacs github] and
[http://gitorious.org/emacsmirror/emacs gitorious].
But be aware that these currently lag behind a bit.
