= Get Emacs with Git =

A Git mirror of the Emacs CVS repository is available.

<pre>
 git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/emacs.git
</pre>
or for those behind a proxy:
<pre>
 git clone http://git.sv.gnu.org/r/emacs.git
</pre>

Beware that this (by design) includes the entire history and therefore weighs about 300MB.

= On the move =

Now that Emacs development has moved to [[Bazaar]] it seems like their is no canonical git mirror yet
(see http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.devel/118918).  Once more information is available I will
update this page (but feel free to do it yourself).
