= Get Emacs with Git =

A Git mirror of the Emacs Bazaar repository is available.

<pre>
 git clone git://repo.or.cz/emacs.git
</pre>
or for those behind a proxy:
<pre>
 git clone http://repo.or.cz/r/emacs.git
</pre>
You can also browse the repository at http://repo.or.cz/w/emacs.git.

Mirrors of the above git repository exist on [http://github.com/emacsmirror/emacs Github] and
[http://gitorious.org/emacsmirror/emacs Gitorious]. But be aware that these currently lag behind a bit.

Beware that this (by design) includes the entire history and therefore weighs about 300MB.

= On the move =

Now that Emacs development has moved to [[Bazaar]] it seems like their is no canonical git mirror yet
(see http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.devel/118918).  Once more information is available I will
update this page (but feel free to do it yourself). Update: the above seams to be the new semi-official
git mirror.
