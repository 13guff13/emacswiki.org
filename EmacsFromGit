== Emacs is moving ==

Once Emacs 24.4 has been released, the current [[Bazaar]] repository is going to be converted to a Git repository.

There have been many attempts to encoure a move to Git, but until [http://article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.devel/167023/match=bzr+dying+emacs+needs+move this] attempt by Eric S. Raymond this was always rejected.  But this time the [http://article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.devel/167032 response] was different.  By now it is clear to many people, not just us Git fanboys, that Bazaar is a sinking ship. Also Eric not only suggested that Emacs move, he also offered to do the hard work himself, which probably helped a lot too.

So thanks to Eric, Richard, Stefan and everyone else who made this a reality.

== Meanwhile... ==

Well almost a reality, as mentioned the move won't be carried out until after Emacs 24.4 is released.  So for now you have to use the official Git /mirror/.  This repository is regularly updated from the Bazaar repository and can be used to build Emacs and also, with some limitations, for development.  Obviously you won't be able to push changes upstream and have to instead send patches by mail, but locally you can work on Emacs using Git.

The current Git mirror is available from Emacs Savannah presence. See [http://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=emacs this] page on Savannah for instructions on how to clone or browse the repository.

<pre>
git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs.git
</pre>

Note that the GNU Elpa package repository is already now maintained using Git.  See the same page for the clone urls.

<pre>
git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs/elpa.git
</pre>

== Alternatives ==

A mirror of the mirror is available at http://repo.or.cz/w/emacs.git and a mirror of that mirror of the other mirror at https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs. Yay, to distributed version control.

If you always just /need/ the very latest commit from the Bazaar repository, you might want to import the Bazaar repository yourself.  You could use one of the many implementations of ##git-bzr## for that purpose.  That's how the current mirror is created.  Or you could use the new remote-helper [https://github.com/felipec/git-remote-bzr git-remote-bzr], which works like this:

<pre>
git clone bzr://bzr.savannah.gnu.org/emacs
</pre>
