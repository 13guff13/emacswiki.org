This has the same goal as ShellDirtrackByPrompt but uses a different approach.
It doesn't require you to change your shell's rc-file.

  (defun track-shell-directory/procfs ()
    (shell-dirtrack-mode 0)
    (add-hook 'comint-preoutput-filter-functions
              (lambda (str)
                (prog1 str
                  (when (string-match comint-prompt-regexp str)
                    (cd (file-symlink-p
                         (format "/proc/%s/cwd" (process-id
                                                 (get-buffer-process
                                                  (current-buffer)))))))))
              nil t))

  (add-hook 'shell-mode-hook 'track-shell-directory/procfs)

This is a problem that disturbed me for a long long time. A very neat solution without making changes to shell script.
