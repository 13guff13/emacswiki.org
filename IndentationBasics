The ##<tab>## key is usually bound to do some mode-specific indentation. People new to Emacs often feel like they just want ##<tab>## to insert a tab. This is of course possible, but discouraged. Why make Emacs dumber than it is? Emacs can figure out how much indentation you need and do the right thing!

Remember, often the indentation engines of major modes can be customized. Specially modes based on [CcMode CC Mode] are notorious for their support of /styles/. See IndentingC for examples.

== Basic Control ==

The variable ##indent-tabs-mode## controls whether tabs are used for indentation. It is ##t## (true) by default; to deactivate it, put the following in <tt>[InitFile .emacs]</tt>.

    (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)

The rest of this page will assume tabs are used and discuss the use of the following two variables:

* ##c-basic-offset##: The basic indentation offset in [CcMode CC Mode], default is 2. For Perl, it is controlled by ##cperl-indent-level##.
* ##tab-width##: How wide a tab is, default is 8.

You /should/ ensure these variables have the same value, e.g.,

    (setq tab-width 4) ; or any other preferred value
    (defvaralias 'c-basic-offset 'tab-width)
    (defvaralias 'cperl-indent-level 'tab-width)

Why did you change `setq' here to `defvaralias'? Why assume that every time someone sets `tab-width' in some buffer (in whatever mode) s?he also wants to set `c-basic-offset' and `cperl-indent-level' to the same value? This seems misguided. Also, the intro line is no longer accurate: you are not simply setting these variables to the same value. -- DrewAdams

[new]
Because it helps make the indentation less dependent on the value of `tab-width'. The defaults are [http://lxr.linux.no/linux+v2.6.29/Documentation/CodingStyle#L467 notoriously horrible] -- try opening the code with different settings, and then try to /figure out/ the original settings necessary to make it readable. It's a mess.

[:TabSizeVsOffset]
It's worse than that, actually. Different values for "tab size" and "indentation" are known to [http://lists.macromates.com/textmate/2007-November/023215.html cause problems for users of the TextMate editor], which treats this as the same number. So the default values of ##2## and ##8## are really a '''hindrance to interoperability'''.

If the indentation offset and tab width are equal when indenting lines, on the other hand, only [[TabsAreEvil#TabsAndAlignment|a few lines]] are garbled with different settings. (Or [SmartTabs none].) `tab-width' and `c-basic-offset' are buffer-local, so changing any of them will only affect the current buffer.

----

The following two commands will be useful when looking at the examples below:

* ##M-x tabify##: Change spaces to tabs where appropriate.
* ##M-x untabify##: Change all tabs to the correct number of spaces (controlled by ##tab-width##).

If you are [IndentingPerl indenting Perl] and the mode is configured to indent by four, and you didn't change the variables above, then the following example will use /no/ tabs! There are no eight spaces in it to replace with a tab.

    sub SmileyReplace {
      foreach my $regexp (keys %Smilies) {
        if (m/\G($regexp)/cg) {
          return $q->img({-src=>$Smilies{$regexp}, -alt=>$1, -class=>'smiley'});
        }
      }
    }

If ##indent-tabs-mode## is ##t## and ##tab-width## is 4, however, you will see three tabs looking four spaces wide:

    sub SmileyReplace {
      foreach my $regexp (keys %Smilies) {
    ____if (m/\G($regexp)/cg) {
    ____  return $q->img({-src=>$Smilies{$regexp}, -alt=>$1, -class=>'smiley'});
    ____}
      }
    }

If you are collaborating with other people, however, and they use different settings, things will get ugly. The tabs may look twice as wide, since the default is 8:

    sub SmileyReplace {
      foreach my $regexp (keys %Smilies) {
    ________if (m/\G($regexp)/cg) {
    ________  return $q->img({-src=>$Smilies{$regexp}, -alt=>$1, -class=>'smiley'});
    ________}
      }
    }

Thus, you should either not change ##tab-width##, or make sure that it matches whatever the indentation steps of your current major mode are.

If you are a die-hard tab user, try using a ##tab-width## of 2. Here's how it will look for you:

    sub SmileyReplace {
    __foreach my $regexp (keys %Smilies) {
    ____if (m/\G($regexp)/cg) {
    ______return $q->img({-src=>$Smilies{$regexp}, -alt=>$1, -class=>'smiley'});
    ____}
    __}
    }

And here for the other poor bastards:

    sub SmileyReplace {
    ________foreach my $regexp (keys %Smilies) {
    ________________if (m/\G($regexp)/cg) {
    ________________________return $q->img({-src=>$Smilies{$regexp}, -alt=>$1, -class=>'smiley'});
    ________________}
    ________}
    }

In summary:

* Only change these variables when you know what you are doing.
* Rely on the indentation suggested by the Emacs major modes.

== Discussion ==

I disagree strongly with the idea that we should rely on the indentation suggested by the Emacs major mode. Instead, I think we should rely on the indentation suggested by the code base we're using. If the code uses tabs, then I believe we should use tabs: Not try to convert everyone to the wisdom of Emacs' major mode.

Sure. When looking at C code, the best is to figure out what style they are using, and switch to the correct style using Emacs Power -- see IndentingC for details. Or, if you are unlucky enough to be on a project requiring special indentation, then set Emacs up to know about this new style. It may take a while, but once you're done, you're going to be so much faster. -- AlexSchroeder

I'm using GNU Emacs 21.3.1, and don't see "##indent-tabs-mode##" when I do a ##C-h f indent-TAB##. Is this a custom emacs lisp collection, or, ...?
-- LionKimbro

[new]
It's a variable. Don't ask me why, I cannot explain it. :) -- AlexSchroeder

[new]
I haven't been able to find this. Is it possible to make Emacs use a /smart/ mix of tabs and spaces? This seems like the obvious right thing to do.

For instance (using 2-space tabs):

    class myclass
    __void mymethod(int arg1,
    __              int arg2,
    __              int arg3) {
    ____statement1;
    ____statement2;
    ____callSomeFunction(someotherarg1,
    ____                 someotherarg2);
    __}
    }

The same code using 8-space tabs would look like this:

    class myclass
    ________void mymethod(int arg1,
    ________              int arg2,
    ________              int arg3) {
    ________________statement1;
    ________________statement2;
    ________________callSomeFunction(someotherarg1,
    ________________                 someotherarg2);
    ________}
    }

You see, the point is to use tabs to indent to a new level (so someone using a different tab-width sees the indentation they like), and use spaces when appropriate to line up with an arbitrary point defined by the actual code (so someone using a different tab-width does /not/ get someotherarg2 way off the side of their screen)

Surprisingly, I don't know of any editor that does this.

I've often wanted the above suggestion, of using tabs for indentation level and spaces for alignment, but not only have I not found it for Emacs, I think the people I share code with wouldn't have anything similar for their editors. So I've given up and just use spaces. --AmitPatel

[new]
**Yes**, it is possible. See SmartTabs.
