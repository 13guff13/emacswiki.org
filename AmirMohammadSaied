I am Amir Mohammad Saied, and nah, I'm not an Arab, I'm a Persian :)

If you really don't have anything better to do now, you may want to take a look at http://www.gluegadget.com/blog/

I'm also known as [::gluegadget] on IRC and my friends usually call me [::amir].

I found this Wiki a valuable resource, and AlexSchroeder a great guy, enjoy it.
