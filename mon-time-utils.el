;;; ================================================================
;;; DESCRIPTION: 
;;; Official my ass! (URL `http://viv.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?EbayTime')
;;; Convert from 'eBay official time' to 'YOUR Official Time Â®'
;;;
;;; There are at least three styles of ebay timestamp. 
;;; Apparently each is 'official'... 
;;; 
;;; Clean up ebay timestrings three different ways. 
;;; * Style1 from eBay webpage i.e. copy/paste
;;; * Style2 from eBay listing manager
;;; * Style3 from eBay post listing email confirmations
;;;
;;; None of these 3(three) styles can be processed with 'parse-time-string'
;;; without some cleaning. 
;;;
;;; The function `mon-cln-ebay-time-string' returns an extended timestamp formatted
;;; such as to allow multiple paths to further processing per ISO 8601 spec. 
;;;
;;; The three ebay timestring styles are cleaned as follows:
;;;
;;; (Aug 07, 200913:52:24 PDT) <-style1
;;; <Timestamp: #{2009-08-07T16:52:24-04:00Z}#{09325} - by Ebay>
;;;
;;; Jul-29 11:05                 <-style2
;;; -> <Timestamp: #{2009-07-29T14:05:00-04:00Z}#{09313} - by Ebay>
;;;
;;; Aug-10-09 09:16:14 PDT       <-style3
;;; -> <Timestamp: #{2009-08-06T21:17:10-04:00Z}#{09325} - by Ebay>
;;;
;;; The form: `(put-tz (if (nth 7 (decode-time)) "PDT" "PST"))'
;;; in `mon-cln-ebay-time-string' assumes your Daylight-savings flag 
;;; is in synch with the Northern Hemisphere. If it Summer in California
;;; but Winter where you are you may want to swap PDT <-> PST
;;; ...I hope i got that right :P
;;;
;;; FUNCTIONS:
;;; `mon-get-current-year'
;;; `mon-convert-ebay-time'
;;; `mon-convert-ebay-time-mvb'

;;;
;;; TODO:
;;; Consider providing an optional arg `mon-cln-ebay-time-string'
;;; to return the stamp without the call to `mon-convert-ebay-time'
;;;
;;; NOTES:
;;; If you should happen to find this code useful please drop eBay a line
;;; and kindly request them to pry their Java loving heads out of their 
;;; asses! What possible reason could there be to maintain at least 3(three)
;;; different timestamp formats??? Also, consider appending a postscript 
;;; requesting a reasonable explanation as to why in this _the 21st C_
;;; (i.e. our glorious technological future) does eBay insist that the 
;;; passage of time continue to be skewed towards PST and PDT... WTF!!!
;;;
;;; ==============================
;;;
;;; The timestamps generate by functions herein are of the form:
;;;
;;; <Timestamp: #{YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+/-HH:MMZ}#{yyWwD} - by NAME>
;;; <Timestamp: #{2009-08-06T21:17:10-04:00Z}#{09325} - by Ebay>
;;;
;;; NOTE: `#{' is a reserved user dispatching macro char in CL
;;;
;;; This format is not at all in keeping with RFC-3339 or ISO-8601 w/re
;;; the discussion presented in Section 5.4. Redundant Information:
;;;
;;;   "If a date/time format includes redundant information, that introduces
;;;    the possibility that the redundant information will not correlate.
;;;    For example, including the day of the week in a date/time format
;;;    introduces the possibility that the day of week is incorrect but the
;;;    date is correct, or vice versa.  Since it is not difficult to compute
;;;    the day of week from a date (see Appendix B), the day of week should
;;;    not be included in a date/time format."
;;;
;;; We do not share this position. While it may be true that redundancies can
;;; present errors whereby a YYYY-Www-D date calculation doesn't jibe with the
;;; YYYY-MM-DD it is incorrect to assume then that we are somehow better off
;;; omitting the Www-D data. This is bogus reasoning as it assumes that the
;;; YYYY-MM-DD date stamp is of itself somehow MORE correct than a YYYY-Www-D
;;; stamp. It is not. Rather than assume that one or another of these data will
;;; become compromised it is safer to assume either that both are potentially
;;; compromised or that both are correct. In either case provision of this
;;; 'redundancy' allows for a check against what would otherwise be uncorroborated
;;; time. Moreover, so long as the information is presented according to the
;;; standards specification it is quite legitimate to simply omit the redundancy via
;;; heuristics (regexps for example). Doing so allows us the ability to calculate
;;; multiple different types of date intervals in an adhoc 'loosey' manner whilst
;;; retaining the ability to perform more targeted calculations where
;;; necessary. This can be esp. important/useful for indicating and reasoning about
;;; time/date ranges by field as opposed by duration. E.g. "Show me all date stamps
;;; on a Tuesday." whether the date is _correct_ may be completely irrelevant to the
;;; query and it is certainly the case that the heuristics/calculations needed for
;;; locating such stamps under our regime will be quite a bit quicker and more
;;; intelligible than those which would require numerous
;;; encode->decode->calculate->encode operations just to find what may or may not be 
;;; a Tuesday...

The standard's grammar spec is unclear w/re time-numoffset, and Emacs'
has interpreted this as permiting mixtures of Extended/Basic format e.g.:\n
 time-numoffset    = \(\"+\" / \"-\"\) time-hour [[\":\"] time-minute]\n
where the \":\" delimiter has been deemed 'optional' to compliance and thereby
ommitted.\n
The current function extends Emacs' interpretation by colon delimiting the 
time-numoffset:
 +/-time-hour:time-minute ->  +/-hh:mm  -> \"-05:00\"\n
Additionally, the \"Zulu\" or trailing Z of ISO-8601/rfc3339 appended to the UTC.\n
