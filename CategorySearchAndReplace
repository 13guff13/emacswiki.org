Emacs can search in the current buffer, across many buffers or in files.

You can also search Emacs internals--like documentation, commands and variables (See SelfDocumentation).
Some [EmacsWiki:CategoryCompletion completion] features use search.

This page is about searching and replacing text in Emacs. Look for `search' in the EmacsManual for more information -- that will also provide info about replacing.

Is there a way to get a search that will work across line boundaries as if they were spaces? I don't want to manually enter [ C-j] each time. --MichaelHoffman

* IncrementalSearch -- aka ‘isearch’. ‘C-s’ and `C-M-s'.
* IsearchPlus -- enhancements to standard IncrementalSearch.
* [[Icicles - Isearch Enhancements]] -- Use Icicles [[completion]] against previous Isearch search strings.
* [[Icicles - Search Commands, Overview]] -– Incremental [[regexp]] search within search contexts, themselves defined using regexps (and their subgroups) or [[text property]] values. Combine syntactic and semantic (predicate) searching. Search and replace across multiple [[buffer]]s or multiple saved [[region]]s. Replace selected individual search hits in any order.
* LazySearch -- A new search mode to search string around point fast.
* OccurMode -- ‘M-x occur’ and family. Like GrepMode, but for buffers, not files.
* ReplacePlus -– Various extensions to OccurMode.
* SearchBuffers -- Like OccurMode, but for multiple buffers.
* SearchNear -- Using OccurMode to find words that are near each other.
* AcmeSearch -- Simple right-click searching.
* SummaryEditMode -- List up matched strings from a buffer, and display them in summary buffer.
* BuffersMisc

[:ReplaceInBuffers]
== Replace in Buffers ==

* ReplaceRegexp -- Query-replace, evaluating a Lisp sexpr for the replacement text.
* IncrementalSearchAndReplace -- Query-replace using the last `isearch' string (Emacs 22).
* [[Icicles - Search-And-Replace]] -– Replace individual search hits in any order. Replace all. Search hits can be regexp matches within a search context that corresponds to a regexp or a regexp-subgroup match. EmacsLisp-sexp replacement text is allowed, as in ReplaceRegexp. Search and replace across multiple buffers or multiple saved regions. 
* ReplacePlus -- Various extensions to vanilla `query-replace'.
* ReplaceRecentCharacter -- Quickly fix typos using a non-incremental search and replace.
* SearchAndReplaceDelimitedStrings -- Replace (only) the prefix and suffix of a pattern.
* ReplaceGarbageChars -- Replace MS and other goofy/"garbage" characters with latin1.  Simple elisp code can be easily applied to LaTeX or HTML or other kinds of buffers.
* QueryExchange -- Exchange two string interactively.


== Search Across Files ==

[new]
How do you avoid grep-find to find matches in backup files and (like *.~* and .#*) by default ?
[new]

You can also, of course, visit files to be searched in buffers, and then use the techniques above for [[#SearchInBuffers]].

* GrepMode -- `M-x grep'
* GrepPlus -- Emacs `grep' enhancements
* [[Icicles - Search Commands, Overview]] -- Icicles search across multiple files: negative prefix to Icicles search commands.
* [[Icicles - Other Search Commands]] -– Use Icicles search in a ##*grep*## (or any compilation) buffer to visit source-file hits. Multiple levels of regexp search.
* RecursiveGrep, `grep-find', `find-grep-dired'
* FindrPackage -- Breadth-first search for files.  Search for regexp within found files.
* [[Namazu]] -- Text indexing and search.
* [[Tracker]] -- Gnome tool for indexing and search
* `M-x find-name-dired'


== Replace Across Files ==

You can also, of course, visit files to be acted on, and then use the techniques above for [[#ReplaceInBuffers]].


* DiredSearchAndReplace (`Q' in Dired) -- Mark files, then search and replace in them.
** FindGrepDiredSearchAndReplace -- find matches in files with grep and replace them with Dired.
** VersionControlSearchAndReplace -- Search and replace VC files, using Dired `Q'.
* [[Icicles - Search-And-Replace]] -- Icicles search-and-replace across multiple files: negative prefix to Icicles search commands.
* [[Icicles - Other Search Commands]] -– Use Icicles search in a ##*grep*## buffer to visit selected source-file hits and replace text within them. Replace all. Use EmacsLisp-sexp replacement, as in ReplaceRegexp. Multiple levels of regexp search. 
* FindrPackage -- Breadth-first search for files. Find/replace text within found files.
* MultiReplace
* Lisp:grep-edit.el http://www.bookshelf.jp/elc/grep-edit.el
* GrepEd Edit 'grep' results and write them back
* (Links are broken or faulty - http://www.peerfear.org/el/replace-recursive.el (successor of http://www.peerfear.org/el/igrep-find-query-replace.el))
* GlobRep Search across multiple files, edit these lines, and save back.
* grep-x similar to GlobRep. http://groups.google.com/groups?q=author:shouman%40goofy.cc.utexas.edu&hl=en&safe=off&rnum=2&selm=SHOUMAN.95Apr26224953%40goofy.cc.utexas.edu Usenet Article 1995/04/27 
* http://groups.google.com/groups?q=replace+group:gnu.emacs.sources
* M-x tags-query-replace requires etags to produce a TagFile.
* TinyReplace replace over multiple files (run M-x grep to and hit % in compile buffer) RCS support.
