Emacs can search in the current buffer, across many buffers or in files.

You can also search Emacs internals--like documentation, commands and variables (See SelfDocumentation).
Some [EmacsWiki:CategoryCompletion completion] features use search.

This page is about searching and replacing text in Emacs. Look for `search' in the EmacsManual for more information -- that will also provide info about replacing.

[new]
Is there a way to get a search that will work across line boundaries as if they were spaces? I don't want to manually enter [ C-j] each time. --MichaelHoffman

* '''IncrementalSearch''' -- aka ‘isearch’. ‘C-s’ and `C-M-s'.
* AcmeSearch -- Simple right-click searching.
* BuffersMisc
* IsearchPlus -- Extensions to Emacs' standard IncrementalSearch.
* [[Icicles]] -- two unrelated features: `icicle-search' and [[completion]] for Isearch:
** [[Icicles - Search Commands, Overview|Icicles search]]: A new kind of [[regexp]] search within search contexts, themselves defined using regexps (and their subgroups) or using [[text property]] values. Combine syntactic and semantic (predicate) searching.
** Use completion against previous [[Icicles - Isearch Enhancements|Isearch search strings]].
* SuperDuperRedundantPlus -- can mark all files in dired buffer using `dired-mark-files-containing-regexp' followed by `dired-do-query-replace-regexp'.
* LazySearch -- A new search mode to search string around point fast.
* OccurMode -- ‘M-x occur’ and family. Like GrepMode, but for buffers, not files.
* ReplacePlus -- Extensions to OccurMode.
* SearchBuffers -- Like OccurMode, but for multiple buffers.
* SearchNear -- Using OccurMode to find words that are near each other.
* SummaryEditMode -- List up matched strings from a buffer, and display them in summary buffer.



[:ReplaceInBuffers]
== Replace in Buffers ==

* ReplaceRegexp -- Query-replace, evaluating a Lisp sexpr for the replacement text.
* IncrementalSearchAndReplace -- Query-replace using the last `isearch' string (Emacs 22).

[:IciclesSearchAndReplace]
* Icicles [[Icicles - Search-And-Replace|search-and-replace]]
-- Replace individual search hits in any order. Replace all. Search hits can be regexp matches within a search context that corresponds to a regexp or a regexp-subgroup match. EmacsLisp-sexp replacement text is allowed, as in ReplaceRegexp. Search and replace across multiple buffers or multiple saved regions. 
* ReplacePlus -- Various extensions to Emacs' standard `query-replace' command.
* ReplaceRecentCharacter -- Quickly fix typos using a non-incremental search and replace.
* SearchAndReplaceDelimitedStrings -- Replace (only) the prefix and suffix of a pattern.
* ReplaceGarbageChars -- Replace MS and other goofy/"garbage" characters with latin1.  Simple elisp code can be easily applied to LaTeX or HTML or other kinds of buffers.
* QueryExchange -- Exchange two string interactively.
* [[Iedit]] -- Replace multiple occurrences of the [[Isearch]] string.




== Search Across Files ==

* GrepMode -- `M-x grep'
* GrepPlus -- Emacs `grep' enhancements
* Icicles search [[Icicles - Search Commands, Overview|across multiple files]]. Icicles [[Icicles - Other Search Commands|compilation search]] to visit source-file hits in a ##*grep*## or any compilation buffer. Multiple levels of regexp search. 
* RecursiveGrep, `grep-find', `find-grep-dired'
* FindrPackage -- Breadth-first search for files.  Search for regexp within found files.
* `M-x find-name-dired'

You can also, of course, visit files to be searched in buffers, and then use the techniques above for [[#SearchInBuffers]].

[new]
How do you avoid grep-find to find matches in backup files and (like *.~* and .#*) by default ?
[new]


== Replace Across Files ==

* `M-x find-name-dired'
* `M-x grep' -- GrepMode
* RecursiveGrep, `grep-find', `find-grep-dired'
* DiredSearchAndReplace (`Q' in Dired) -- Mark files, then search and replace in them.
** FindGrepDiredSearchAndReplace -- find matches in files with grep and replace them with Dired.
* Lisp:grep-edit.el http://www.bookshelf.jp/elc/grep-edit.el
* GrepEd Edit 'grep' results and write them back
* GlobRep Search across multiple files, edit these lines, and save back.
* grep-x similar to GlobRep. http://groups.google.com/groups?q=author:shouman%40goofy.cc.utexas.edu&hl=en&safe=off&rnum=2&selm=SHOUMAN.95Apr26224953%40goofy.cc.utexas.edu Usenet Article 1995/04/27 
* http://groups.google.com/groups?q=replace+group:gnu.emacs.sources
* FindrPackage -- Breadth-first search for files.  Search for regexp within found files.
** VersionControlSearchAndReplace -- Search and replace VC files, using Dired `Q'.
* `M-x tags-query-replace' -- replace using etags' TagFile.
* Icicles [[Icicles - Search-And-Replace|search-and-replace]] 
-- see [[#IciclesSearchAndReplace|above]]. Use Icicles [[Icicles - Other Search Commands|compilation search-and-replace]] to visit source-file hits in a ##*grep*## buffer and replace text within them.
* MultiReplace
* TinyReplace replace over multiple files (run M-x grep to and hit % in compile buffer) RCS support.
* TraverseDirectory search a word or regexp in all files in dir and subdir (recursive search).
