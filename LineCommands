; `M-x flush-lines':
Very nice command to get rid of garbage lines, lines with debug code etc., that match a certain REGEXP.

; `M-x keep-lines':
The opposite of flush-lines -- decide with a regexp wich lines to keep. Dangerous! :)

; `M-x occur':
See OccurBuffer.

; `M-x sort-lines':
See [[Sorting]].

MoveByVisibleLineCommands - commands to move by visible instead of logical lines (those differs when lines are wrapped)

See BackToIndentationOrBeginning for a way to go to the beginning of the first word on the line; a command helpful to those who miss the ##Home## key.

See GotoLine for jumping to a line number.

Some more advanced commands:

 (defun pg-kill-this-line (n)
   "Kill the line point is on.
  With prefix arg, kill this many lines starting at the line point is on."
   (interactive "p")
   (kill-region (line-beginning-position)
	        (progn (forward-line n) (point))))

 (defun pg-duplicate-this-line (n)
   "Duplicates the line point is on.  
 With prefix arg, duplicate current line this many times."
   (interactive "p")
   (save-excursion 
     (copy-region-as-kill (line-beginning-position) 
      			 (progn (forward-line 1) (point)))
      (while (< 0 n)
       (yank)
       (setq n (1- n)))))
