= Autoloading Emacs modules =

Emacs can be configured at start-time to automatically load extra modules whenever you try to use a command from these modules.  This is a very useful feature if often find yourself using lots of Emacs extensions but you do not want to spend a lot of time loading them when Emacs starts.  There is no reason to load stuff that you are very likely to throw away very soon, by closing your Emacs session.

Now that the world has started paying more attention to power consumption and the processing power that is wasted, autoloading can help you make your Emacs sessions more ''green'' :-)

= My Current Autoload Setup =

My laptop's current setup loads a list of ##autoload## options at startup time, and then it lets Emacs handle the rest.  The ##autoload## options are stored in a file called ##keramida-autoload.el## in my ##~/elisp## directory, so the first step of finding the autoload options to add a bit of EmacsLisp code in my ##.emacs## file to point at the right `##load-path##' and then `##require##' the module that enables my preferred autoloading options:

    ;; Make sure Emacs can find loadable files in ~/elisp.
    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp")

    ;; Pull in my autoload setup forms.
    (require 'keramida-autoload)

The ##keramida-autoload## feature is provided by the file ##keramida-autoload.el##, which contains the following EmacsLisp code:

    ;;; keramida-autoload.el --- autoload options for my Emacs setup

    ;; Setup for stuff that gets autoloaded by Emacs when I use a command,
    ;; call a function or access some feature.  To successfully load some
    ;; of these features, you may need to install extra Emacs packages or
    ;; some custom Emacs Lisp code in your '~/elisp' directory.  See the
    ;; comments near each `autoload' line for more details.

    ;; This depends on the Slime Lisp mode.  You can download the latest
    ;; version of Slime from its homepage:
    ;;
    ;;    http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/
    ;;
    (autoload 'slime "slime.el" "The Superior LISP mode for Emacs" t)

    ;; The `gtags-mode' is a replacement tag searching and browsing mode,
    ;; that is distributed with the "GNU Global" utilities.  You will have
    ;; to copy the `gtags.el' file from the source distribution of global,
    ;; and install it somewhere in your `load-path' for this to work.  The
    ;; GNU global utilities can be downloaded from their homepage:
    ;;
    ;;     http://www.gnu.org/software/global/
    ;;
    (autoload 'gtags-mode "gtags.el" "GNU global integration" t)

    (provide 'keramida-autoload)

    ;;; keramida-autoload.el ends here
