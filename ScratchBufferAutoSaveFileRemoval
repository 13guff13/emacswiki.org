The `*scratch*' buffer is created by Emacs automatically at startup.  Unfortunately, it is automatically saved into files of the form:

  #!scratch!...

and accumulate over time.  I added the following to the end of my .emacs
to insure that they are not saved at all:

    (with-current-buffer (get-buffer "*scratch*")
      (auto-save-mode -1))

See also RecreateScratchBuffer for more information on scratch buffer.

Emacs doesn't set the ##*scratch*## buffer to have `auto-save-mode' on by default.  Sounds like something has gone wrong with your setup somehow.
