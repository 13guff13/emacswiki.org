My name is John H. Anthony, and I'm currently living in Trondheim, Norway.

I have been using GNU Emacs for 1-2 years now. Gnus for mail and news, ERC for irc. I use Emacs for almost everything.

You can reach me either as jantho on #emacs or #linux.no (sic) @ irc.freenode.org, or by email: jantho@taggie.no or jantho@member.fsf.org
