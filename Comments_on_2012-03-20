Nice move to add the link to show the wiki in Wikipedia style :)

Meh, "Talk" pages.  I say we just ignore the troll baiting and keep the old CSS and the inline discussion.  These two changes aren't going to fix the issues with the material on the site anyway.

Not so sure about that.
IIRC the idea of the comment in the page was that someone will see the mess and delete the comments and refactor the page.
In practice I don't think it has worked. See http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/?action=browse;diff=2;id=Magit for instance, the guy just put a question out of the blue in the middle of the page and after 2 months nobody answered, nobody removed the questions.

How do you navigate between a site and it's discussion (apart from adding "Comments_on" to the URL by hand)? Ah, I see it on the bottom. Should this be a bit more obvious?

shjk, I can make it more obvious if you can suggest a particular change you'd like to see. My web design-fu is weak...

AlexSchroeder: here is an attempt. It's put just below the page title in the hope that's a location which will not be missed. I created a little CSS/Html mess, though. It might be a good idea to ask someone with better knowledge of this stuff than me to implement this properly :)

[[image:LinkToTalkPageSuggestionImage]]

The article itself would get a "To Discussion" link.

Added to wiki.css:

    .article_talk_nav {
        font-size: 40%;
        line-height: 30%;
        letter-spacing: 0;
    }

    div.article_talk_nav a:link {
        color:#00F;
        text-decoration: underline;
    }
    div.article_talk_nav a:visited {
        color:#A0A;
        text-decoration: underline;
    }
    div.article_talk_nav a:active {
        color:#F00;
        text-decoration: underline;
    }


Added to page html:

  <div class="article_talk_nav">
    <br><a title="To Article" href="article">To Article</a>
  </div>

This is added into the page title like this (formatting changed):
    <br><span class="specialdays">Bangladesh, Independence Day</span>
    
    <h1>
      <a title="Click to search for references to this page" rel="nofollow"
         href="http://www.google.com/cse?cx=004774160799092323420:6-ff2s0o6yi&amp;q=%22Comments%20on%202012-03-20%22">
        Comments on 2012-03-20
      </a>
      <div class="article_talk_nav">
        <br><a title="To Article" href="article">To Article</a>
      </div>
    </h1>
    </div>

[:talkative]
Hm, below the title. Interesting… Ideally, this would work without modification of the HTML source, though. Otherwise all the other CSS files (including the ’Pedia theme) would get messed up. Sometimes it is possibly to do this using absolute positioning. This necessarily requires the header to not have line-breaks (which introduces usability issues for people with narrow screens). Here's a first attempt at achieving it:

* [EmacsWiki:action=browse;id=Comments_on_2012-03-20;css=/css/talkative-emacs.css;theme=#talkative use Talkative Emacs theme]

* [EmacsWiki:action=browse;id=Comments_on_2012-03-20;css=;theme=#talkative back to the default theme]

Depending on how this looks on narrow screens, perhaps we should force a linebreak in front of the search box.
