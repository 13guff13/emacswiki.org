Nice move to add the link to show the wiki in Wikipedia style :)

Meh, "Talk" pages.  I say we just ignore the troll baiting and keep the old CSS and the inline discussion.  These two changes aren't going to fix the issues with the material on the site anyway.

Not so sure about that.
IIRC the idea of the comment in the page was that someone will see the mess and delete the comments and refactor the page.
In practice I don't think it has worked. See http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/?action=browse;diff=2;id=Magit for instance, the guy just put a question out of the blue in the middle of the page and after 2 months nobody answered, nobody removed the questions.

How do you navigate between a site and it's discussion (apart from adding "Comments_on" to the URL by hand)? Ah, I see it on the bottom. Should this be a bit more obvious?
