A wiki is an editable web site.  Anybody can contribute.
That's it.  :)

Now go back to the HowTo.

If you want to fool around, visit the test wiki:

* http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/test

You can also use the SandBox.

== Wikis, In General ==

* You can also read more about it on [[Oddmuse:What Is A Wiki]].
* Community:WhyWikiWorks explains why wikis (hopefully) generate
interesting content and why there is not much abuse.
* Oddmuse:SiteMap is the homepage of the wiki engine -- the CGI script
(in Perl, I am sorry to say) that produces the pages you are reading.
* See TextFormattingRules for the basic formatting rules you need.
