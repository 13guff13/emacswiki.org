My name is Xah Lee.  I use Emacs, and have since 1997, live in emacs daily since 1998, and love it.

I am a mild supporter of FSF/GNU. I urge programers to take a class in college on sociology, economics, history, philosophy.

Most Open Source or FSF proponents are youngsters who's got nothing to loose, and “freedom” is just their execuse to advance their self interests. (freedom fighters are almost always losers to begin with, and invariably they are the primary beneficiary of the “freedom” they clamour. When you are poor, student, no ability or interest in business, then, you are likely to love opinions advanced by orgnization such as FSF, e.g. no patent, open source. But if you do have business abilities, have commercially valuable software, have patents, you are not likely to believe in FSF's ideas. Most FSF fans are just another selfish person doing [[http://xahlee.org/Netiquette_dir/hackernews_xahleeorg_politics.html politics]], really nothing unusual when compared to the history of human animals (all the political upheavals, revolutions, social movements, ideologies). Also note, Richard Stallman's “Free” software, is just one philosophy on software's distribution and use, among a few. He abuses the word “free” and freely connect it with the concept of Freedom in the context of human rights. FSF's particular philosophy on software use really have little to do with general concept, or importance, of Human Rights or Freedom. The moral concept of “Human Rights” itself is just one among many philosophies.)

Hi, Xah.  Wondered if that was really you, based on the initial post. This update removes any doubt --ChristopherSmith. ;)

: Greetings, comrade. —Xah

Xah has also been a well known troll on various comp.lang.* newsgroups and played in the same league as ErikNaggum.
Just browse some older stuff in the [http://groups.google.com/groups?as_q=fuck&as_ugroup=comp.lang.*&as_uauthors=xah+lee&safe=off Usenet archives]. -- AlexSchroeder

[new]
Older?  Xah remains trollific in the present tense, as a glance at comp.lang.python reveals.  Use of emacs reveals Xah isn't completely bad, no? --ChristopherSmith

: dear Christopher, by the way, i left a reply on your page about the naming of Mac OS X. However, some [self-censored] went ahead and deleted it. I don't think he asked you before hand. It is not even his [self-censored] business. Sometimes i wonder, if we should forgive these younsters. But then, just because one has bad childhood doesn't obliterate all a psychopath's crimes. It is behaviors like these, that pains me. —Xah

::: Thanks for the pointer--I restored your remark.  As Zappa so eloquently put it, "Censorship is like treating dandruff through decapitation".  Though if I could recommend a book to you, Sun Tzu makes some excellent points about non-frontal assaults, and I feel that the points you make in various fora would have more impact if they hit from the flank more often than square-on. ;) --ChristopherSmith

I'd prefer decent language on the wiki. -- AlexSchroeder

: Alex, was it you who censored my post before? why don't you just say so? because it seems anonymous, and more than just four-letter words are deleted.—Xah

Nope, it wasn't me.  I sure agree with the sentiment, however.  :)  -- AlexSchroeder

: OK. Thanks for the note. —Xah

Note to Alex Schroeder: This page doesn't validate, apparantly because of the «dl» tag. —Xah Lee, 2006-08-30

You might want to change "youngsters who’s got nothing to loose" to "youngsters who've got nothing to lose".  I am not 
being critical, just trying to be helpful.  I'm guessing that English is not your first language.
