My name is Xah Lee.  I use Emacs, and have since 1997, daily, and love it.

I have some emacs and elisp tutorial here:

* http://xahlee.org/emacs/emacs.html
* http://xahlee.org/emacs/elisp.html

Here's some elisp code i wrote:

* A emacs keybinding set based on ergonomics. Google Code url: [[http://code.google.com/p/ergoemacs/ Ergoemacs]]
* xlsl-mode, a mode for Linden Scripting Language. Google Code url: [[http://code.google.com/p/lsl-mode/ xlsl-mode]]. Emacs wiki page here: [[LSLMode]]

I am a mild supporter of FSF/GNU. I urge programers to take a class in college on sociology, economics, history, philosophy. (or, read some *text book* on these, as opposed to prose work on these subjects or science fiction.) Most Open Sourcers are basically poor ignorant youngsters who's got nothing to loose and “freedom” is just their brand to get ahead of the world for themselves. (freedom fighters are almost always losers to begin with, and invariably they are the primary beneficiary of the “freedom” they clamour.)

Hi, Xah.  Wondered if that was really you, based on the initial post. This update removes any doubt --ChristopherSmith. ;)

: Greetings, comrade. —Xah

Xah has also been a well known troll on various comp.lang.* newsgroups and played in the same league as ErikNaggum.
Just browse some older stuff in the [http://groups.google.com/groups?as_q=fuck&as_ugroup=comp.lang.*&as_uauthors=xah+lee&safe=off Usenet archives]. -- AlexSchroeder

Older?  Xah remains trollific in the present tense, as a glance at comp.lang.python reveals.  Use of emacs reveals Xah isn't completely bad, no? --ChristopherSmith

: dear Christopher, by the way, i left a reply on your page about the naming of Mac OS X. However, some [self-censored] went ahead and deleted it. I don't think he asked you before hand. It is not even his [self-censored] business. Sometimes i wonder, if we should forgive these younsters. But then, just because one has bad childhood doesn't obliterate all a psychopath's crimes. It is behaviors like these, that pains me. —Xah

::: Thanks for the pointer--I restored your remark.  As Zappa so eloquently put it, "Censorship is like treating dandruff through decapitation".  Though if I could recommend a book to you, Sun Tzu makes some excellent points about non-frontal assaults, and I feel that the points you make in various fora would have more impact if they hit from the flank more often than square-on. ;) --ChristopherSmith

I'd prefer decent language on the wiki. -- AlexSchroeder

: Alex, was it you who censored my post before? why don't you just say so? because it seems anonymous, and more than just four-letter words are deleted.—Xah

Nope, it wasn't me.  I sure agree with the sentiment, however.  :)  -- AlexSchroeder

: OK. Thanks for the note. —Xah

Note to Alex Schroeder: This page doesn't validate, apparantly because of the «dl» tag. —Xah Lee, 2006-08-30

You might want to change "youngsters who’s got nothing to loose" to "youngsters who've got nothing to lose".  I am not 
being critical, just trying to be helpful.  I'm guessing that English is not your first language.
