'''_Vocabulary:_''' In Emacs, we call '''killing''' what others call ''cutting'', and '''yanking''' what others call ''pasting''. We call "saving onto the kill-ring" what others call ''copying'' text. The '''kill-ring''' is similar to a ''clipboard'': it is a list of the last 60 killed items, from which items can be yanked.

The default command for killing the selected region is `kill-region' (`C-w'). The command for saving (copying) text to the `kill-ring' is `kill-ring-save' (`M-w').

Text removed with the `delete-*' commands, such as `delete-backwards-char' (`DEL'), is not saved to the `kill-ring'. 

Yanking inserts the last killed item from the head of the list, but you can cycle through the list to instead yank previously killed or copied text using `M-y'.

== Cycling forwards ==

`M-y' (`yank-pop') cycles backwards through the `kill-ring'. Here's a way to cycle in the reverse direction with `M-Y' (Meta-<i>Shift</i>-Y):

    (defun yank-pop-backwards (arg)
      (interactive "p")
      (yank-pop (- arg)))

    (global-set-key "\M-Y" 'yank-pop-backwards) ; M-Y (Meta-Shift-Y)

== Deleting word backwards ==

The following may be of interest to people who (a) are happy with `C-w' and friends for killing and yanking, (b) use `transient-mark-mode', (c) also like the traditional Unix TTY behaviour that `C-w' deletes a word backwards and (d) use GnuEmacs. It tweaks `C-w' so that, if the mark is inactive, it deletes a word backwards instead of killing the region:

    (defadvice kill-region (before unix-werase activate compile)
      "When called interactively with no active region, delete a single word
    backwards instead."
      (interactive
       (if mark-active (list (region-beginning) (region-end))
         (list (save-excursion (backward-word 1) (point)) (point)))))

[new:Who?:Who?]
Doing this as advice (as opposed to a new function bound to C-w) seems like a bad idea -- what happens if some other elisp function calls `kill-region'?

[new]
Could not agree more.  What if `transient-mark-mode' is not on?  This is a poor use of advice.

    (defun unix-werase-or-kill (arg)
      (interactive "*p")
      (if (and transient-mark-mode
        	   mark-active)
          (kill-region (region-beginning) (region-end))
        (backward-kill-word arg)))

[new]
I don't think this is a problem, since the advice is interactive. Thus it is not invoked in a regular function call.

As it happens, the same principle is employed in SlickCopy, which copies the current line when the mark is inactive.
