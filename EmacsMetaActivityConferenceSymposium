I want us to create a self-organizing recurring event called the Emacs
Meta Activity Conference Symposium. Goals could be things like:

* to share our knowledge of Emacs and its various uses in an informal, semi-structured setting
* to help people learn Emacs and get involved in the community
* to encourage discussion of EmacsLisp programming 
* to talk about the future of Emacs
* to build a high-quality library of articles, screencasts, and other educational materials (i.e. archived conference proceedings)
* to have fun!

There would be two different strands:

==online version==
* presentations, articles, and screencasts
* dedicated IRC channel #emacs-conference for discussion
* dedicated torrent for multimedia distribution
* would happen over a couple of days (probably a weekend)
* people in various time zones could catch up at their leisure

==live-action version==
* presentations and demos
* coffee (or just have the event near a coffee shop)
* performance art
* live streaming audio with audience feedback via IRC? (i have some
  hardware to support this)
* rms keynote?    

==informal irc poll==

There were five votes in favor of the conference, and none opposed.

==discussion==

Sounds like (replace-regexp-in-string "Bar" "Emacs" "BarCamp") to me. Great idea! If it's held in Boston or on the US's West Coast, I'm in. -- EdwardOConnor

I hate to be a sourpuss, but I don't really want to sign up for that website. 
I think it would be better for people to post their comments on this wiki page. --DavidOtoole
