This picks the last message somebody said in the channel buffer and
runs doctor on it, when you type the /DOCTOR command.

Features:

* Determine the sender of the last message and prepend their name and a colon to the output of doctor.  Only do this if we're not in a query buffer.

* When the last user typed something in like: "random_user: I think you need to get more sleep at night instead of coding elisp", try to strip away the "random_user:" part before sending the text to doctor.

* Strip unnecessary punctuation from the end of the input message.

* Keep a separate buffer for each patient of the doctor.

Kind of reminds me -- back in the 80s, I wrote a command that made `doctor' communicate with Zippy (`yow'!). I won't say who was consulting whom, but it was quite enlightening either way you looked at it. :D. -- DrewAdams
* `M-x psychoanalyze-pinhead' is part of the standard `yow' package, and has been for a long time. -- EraEriksson
