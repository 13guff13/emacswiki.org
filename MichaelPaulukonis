[[http://michaelpaulukonis.com|Michael Paulukonis]] often refers to himself in the third person. He is also known as (the) Other Michael.
Unsurprisingly for an user-page in this wiki, he uses Emacs.

But only since the summer of 2007, and mainly on [[EmacsW32|Windows]].

He can also be found online at http://michaelpaulukonis.com/ and http://www.xradiograph.com/Emacs

He's a member of the FSF -- and [[http://www.fsf.org/register_form?referrer=8082 you should be, too]] (especially if you use Emacs) !

Thanks, Drew -- 'cept I've been here for years. Just renamed the page from my "handle" to my "real name." -- MichaelPaulukonis


[:todo]
== TODOs ==
* look at WikiModeDiscussion
* [[CSS]]
** look into darkstrap
** look into variant on [EmacsWiki:action=browse;bootstrap=0;id=CSS;css=/css/pedia.css wikipedia css] -- I like how the layout works, just not the stark-white fluorscently-lit colors (it's like a website at walmart)
* look at DropBox notes -- implement, test, and update page
** I've been using DropBox for years, and Emacs, and never investigate the full potential
** I believe I saw something about TODOs in Emacs and dropbox in the soi-distant past....
** my notes @ http://www.xradiograph.com/Programming/DropBox
** and this [[https://twitter.com/noahsussman/status/969924361 cryptic, pregnant tweet]]
* whee! [[CategoryGames|games!]] I didn't know most of these existed. As if I'd have the time....

== Projects ==
* hoping to work on pmwiki-mode
** started up an org/repo @ https://github.com/emacs-pmwiki-mode
** need to start an Emacswiki page for it....

* [[Journal]] - I use a modified version of this. 
** created a repo @ https://github.com/MichaelPaulukonis/fisler-journal.el
*** contains original code as found @ [[Journal]] and my modifications
** TODO: Clean up code, prefix-space ("namespace") the code, and fix the issues
** I'm migrating over to use org-mode, but I used [[Journal]] for about 6 years; I have a lot of fondness for it
** and it's influenced how I ''want'' to work with org-mode (which may not be how I ''should'' work with org-mode)

* working on documentation withing CategoryJavaScript

* OrgMode
** learning and using....

== Packages/pages/things I like ==
* [[Reference_Sheet_by_Aaron_Hawley]]
* ElScreen
* [[ELPA]]
* [[Js2Mode]] and [[CategoryJavaScript]] - where's he trying to add some signal to the noise
* [http://www.splode.com/~friedman/software/emacs-lisp/src/string-fns.el string-fns.el] via [http://www.splode.com/~friedman/software/emacs-lisp/ Noah Friedman]
* [[extraedit.el]]
* [[DiredPlus]]
* [[NxmlModeForXHTML]]
* [[CategoryWThirtyTwo]] since I primarily use Windows. :::sigh:::
* [[Journal]] - I use a modified version of this. 
** see also: JournalMode - not the same thing. differences?

== Packages I used to like ==
* [[emacs-w3m]]
** I don't have anything against w3m, I just don't use it anymore. too much Javascript in my world.... 


== Packages, Pages, and things I am thinking about liking ==
* BookmarkPlus
* a way to get nxml mode to be happy with html5
* a NodeJs mode that gives me auto-completion on the REPL '''within Emacs, of course'''
* [[SkeletonMode]]
* [[SachaChua]] - in particular, the link about re-orging the .emacs file
