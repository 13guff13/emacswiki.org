[[http://michaelpaulukonis.com|Michael Paulukonis]] often refers to himself in the third person. He is also known as (the) Other Michael.
Unsurprisingly for an user-page in this wiki, he uses Emacs.

But only since the summer of 2007, and mainly on [[EmacsW32|Windows]].

He can also be found online at http://michaelpaulukonis.com/ and http://www.xradiograph.com/Emacs

He's a member of the FSF -- and [[http://www.fsf.org/register_form?referrer=8082 you should be, too]] (especially if you use Emacs) !

[:todo]
== TODOs ==
* [[Journal]] - I use a modified version of this. Should push the modifications back to public. And fix the issues
* cleanup the [[MichaelPaulukonis#navigation|navigation section]] below
* look at WikiModeDiscussion
** revisit pmwiki-mode
*** start an Emacs-wiki page for it??
* [[CSS]]
** look into darkstrap
** look into variant on [EmacsWiki:action=browse;bootstrap=0;id=CSS;css=/css/pedia.css wikipedia css] -- I like how the layout works, just not the stark-white fluorscently-lit colors (it's like a website at walmart)

== Packages/pages/things I like ==
* [[Reference_Sheet_by_Aaron_Hawley]]
* ElScreen
* [[ELPA]]
* [[Js2Mode]] and [[CategoryJavaScript]] - where's he trying to add some signal to the noise
* [http://www.splode.com/~friedman/software/emacs-lisp/src/string-fns.el string-fns.el] via [http://www.splode.com/~friedman/software/emacs-lisp/ Noah Friedman]
* [[extraedit.el]]
* [[DiredPlus]]
* [[NxmlModeForXHTML]]
* [[CategoryWThirtyTwo]] since I primarily use Windows. :::sigh:::

* [[Journal]] - I use a modified version of this. 
** see also: JournalMode - not the same thing. differences?

== Packages I used to like ==
* [[emacs-w3m]]
** I don't have anything against w3m, I just don't use it anymore. too much Javascript in my world.... 


== Packages, Pages, and things I am thinking about liking ==
* BookmarkPlus
* OrgMode - c'mon. it's a bout time.
* a way to get nxml mode to be happy with html5
* a NodeJs mode that gives me auto-completion on the REPL '''within Emacs, of course'''
* [[SkeletonMode]]
* [[SachaChua]] - in particular, the link about re-orging the .emacs file
