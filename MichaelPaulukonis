[[http://michaelpaulukonis.com|Michael Paulukonis]] often refers to himself in the third person. He is also known as (the) Other Michael.
Unsurprisingly for an user-page in this wiki, he uses Emacs.

But only since the summer of 2007, and mainly on [[EmacsW32|Windows]].

He can also be found online at http://michaelpaulukonis.com/ and http://www.xradiograph.com/Emacs
