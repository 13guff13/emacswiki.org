*nrepl.el* is an Emacs client for nREPL, the Clojure networked REPL server. It's a great alternative to the now deprecated combination of [[SLIME]] + swank-clojure.

nrepl.el is available for installation from both [[Marmalade]] and [[MELPA]].

Its source code can be found on [[https://github.com/kingtim/nrepl.el GitHub]].
