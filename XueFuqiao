I use Emacs.

My name is Xue Fuqiao.  English is not my native language; please
excuse typing errors.  I'm a GNU/Linux user.  Currently I use
Emacs on an old laptop with a DvorakKeyboard.  My favorite font (for
English) is [http://www.proggyfonts.com ProggyTiny].

I was born and raised in Xinjiang, China, and I'm currently a student
of [http://www.ncut.edu.cn NCUT].  My major is Communication
Engineering.

Many thanks to the people who contributed or are contributing to
emacsen and EmacsWiki.  My daily life becomes very interesting.

You can contact me using (please send plain text mail, not HTML):
<code>
(concat (list 120 102 113) [46] (mapconcat (cl-function (lambda (x) (format "%c" (1- x)))) "gsff" "") " AT " "gmail" "." "com")

Feel free to ask anything about Emacs :)

It looks like you have a lot of work to do! It may be worth looking at
the clx package for Common Lisp to see if it could be ported to
Elisp. It would be cool to be able to display an X-window in an Emacs
window. One problem with doing this sort of thing properly is that,
unlike most versions of Common Lisp, Elisp isn't (yet?)
multi-threaded. I have a feeling that it would take a lot of work to
convert it. One thing that might be possible is to build a clone of
Elisp on top of Common Lisp I don't know how efficient that would
be. But it would require that all Elisp code works in a
lexical-binding environment. If it could be done you would get
multi-threading for free and such things as the clx library for
manipulating X.

this is actually already possible with an Emacs branch, see EmacsXWidgets
