Emacs is the one.

My name is Xue Fuqiao.  I have been a GNU/Linux user since 2008.  I've been an [[Emacsite]] since 2009 and began to write programs in
EmacsLisp since 2011.  Started with XEmacs, switched to
SXEmacs, back to XEmacs, and now I'm using GnuEmacs and Guile-based Emacs. I don't like using the Emacs
Lisp package manager.  Instead, I like install additional Lisp
packages by hand, which is flexible.  I prefer to learn new things
from reference manuals, instead of tutorials.  My favorite font is
[http://www.proggyfonts.com proggy_tiny]. Currently I use GNU Emacs on
a laptop with a [[Colemak]] layout.

I'm a software developer and software freedom activist.  And Iâ€™m currently a student of [http://www.ncut.edu.cn NCUT].  My major is Communication Engineering.

I'm a [http://www.fsf.org/free-software-supporter/ Free Software Supporter].
