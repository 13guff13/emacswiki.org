== About Me ==
I use Emacs.

My name is Xue Fuqiao.  I have been a GNU/Linux user since 2008.
I've been an [[Emacsite]] since 2009 and began to write programs
in EmacsLisp since 2011.  Started with [[XEmacs]], switched to
[[SXEmacs]], back to XEmacs, and now I'm using GnuEmacs and
GuileEmacs.  I don't like using the Emacs Lisp package manager.
Instead, I like install additional Lisp packages by hand, which
is flexible.  I prefer to learn new things from reference
manuals, instead of tutorials.  My favorite font is
[http://www.proggyfonts.com proggy_tiny]. Currently I use GNU
Emacs on a laptop with a ColemakKeyboard.

I'm a software developer and software freedom activist.  And I’m
currently a student of [http://www.ncut.edu.cn NCUT].  My major
is Communication Engineering.

I'm a [http://www.fsf.org/free-software-supporter/ Free Software
Supporter].

== RSI ==
Started physiotherapy on June, 2012.

== Motto ==
* There is no system but GNU, and Linux is one of its kernel.

* I've used Emacs for many years now, but have never reached its maximum potential.

* It is a logical impossibility to make a language more powerful by omitting features, no matter how bad they may be.
