== About Me ==
I use Emacs.

Welcome to my homepage.  My name is Xue Fuqiao.  English is not my native language; please excuse typing errors.  I have been a GNU/Linux user since 2008.
I've been an [[Emacsite]] since 2009 and began to write programs
in EmacsLisp since 2011.  Started with [[XEmacs]], switched to
[[SXEmacs]], back to XEmacs, then to GuileEmacs, and now I'm using Emacs.  I prefer to learn new things from reference
manuals, instead of tutorials.  Currently I use Emacs on a laptop with a DvorakKeyboard.

Many thanks to the people who contributed or are contributing to Emacs, [[XEmacs]] and EmacsWiki.  My daily life and work becomes very interesting.

I'm a software developer and software freedom activist.  And Iâ€™m
currently a student of [http://www.ncut.edu.cn NCUT].  My major
is Communication Engineering.  Feel free to ask anything about Emacs :)

I'm a [http://www.fsf.org/free-software-supporter/ Free Software
Supporter].

* There is no system but GNU, and Linux is one of its kernel.

* I've used Emacs for many years now, but have never reached its maximum potential.

* It is a logical impossibility to make a language more powerful by omitting features, no matter how bad they may be.  -- [[WikiPedia:John_Hughes_(computer_scientist)|John Hughes]]

* While any text editor can save your files, only Emacs can save your soul.

* Microsoft is not the answer.  Microsoft is the question.  NO is the answer.

= Comment on Wish List =
It looks like you have a lot of work to do! It may be worth looking at the clx package for Common Lisp to see if it could be ported to Elisp. It would be cool to be able to display an X-window in an Emacs window. One problem with doing this sort of thing properly is that, unlike most versions of Common Lisp, Elisp isn't (yet?) multi-threaded. I have a feeling that it would take a lot of work to convert it. One thing that might be possible is to build a clone of Elisp on top of Common Lisp I don't know how efficient that would be. But it would require that all Elisp code works in a lexical-binding environment. If it could be done you would get multi-threading for free and such things as the clx library for manipulating X.
