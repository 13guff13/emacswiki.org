== About Me ==
I use Emacs.

My name is Xue Fuqiao.  I have been a GNU/Linux user since 2008.  I've been an [[Emacsite]] since 2009 and began to write programs in
EmacsLisp since 2011.  Started with [[XEmacs]], switched to
[[SXEmacs]], back to XEmacs, and now I'm using GnuEmacs and Guile-based Emacs. I don't like using the Emacs
Lisp package manager.  Instead, I like install additional Lisp
packages by hand, which is flexible.  I prefer to learn new things
from reference manuals, instead of tutorials.  My favorite font is
[http://www.proggyfonts.com proggy_tiny]. Currently I use GNU Emacs on
a laptop with a ColemakKeyboard.

I'm a software developer and software freedom activist.  And Iâ€™m currently a student of [http://www.ncut.edu.cn NCUT].  My major is Communication Engineering.

I'm a [http://www.fsf.org/free-software-supporter/ Free Software Supporter].

== RSI ==
Started physiotherapy on June, 2012.

== Motto ==
* There is no system but GNU, and Linux is one of its kernel.

* I've used Emacs for many years now, but have never reached its maximum potential.

* It is a logical impossibility to make a language more powerful by omitting features, no matter how bad they may be.
