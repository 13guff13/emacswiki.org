== About Me ==
Hi,

I use Emacs.

Welcome to my homepage.  My name is Xue Fuqiao.  English is not my
native language; please excuse typing errors.  I have been a GNU/Linux
user since 2008.  I've been an [[Emacsite]] since 2009 and began to write
programs in EmacsLisp since 2011.  Started with [[XEmacs]], switched to
[[SXEmacs]], back to XEmacs, then to GuileEmacs, and now I'm using Emacs.
I prefer to learn new things from reference manuals, instead of
tutorials.  Currently I use Emacs on an old laptop with a
ColemakKeyboard.  My favorite font is [http://www.proggyfonts.com
ProggyTiny].  And I'm also a fan of science fiction.

Many thanks to the people who contributed or are contributing to
Emacs, [[XEmacs]] and EmacsWiki.  My daily life and work becomes very
interesting.

Iâ€™m currently a student of [http://www.ncut.edu.cn NCUT].  My major is
Communication Engineering.  Feel free to ask anything about Emacs :)

I'm a [http://www.fsf.org/free-software-supporter/ FreeSoftwareSupporter] and a [http://www.gp.org Green Party] supporter.

* There is no system but GNU, and Linux is one of its kernels.

* It is a logical impossibility to make a language more powerful by omitting features, no matter how bad they may be.  -- [[WikiPedia:John_Hughes_(computer_scientist)|John Hughes]]

= Comments =

It looks like you have a lot of work to do! It may be worth looking at
the clx package for Common Lisp to see if it could be ported to
Elisp. It would be cool to be able to display an X-window in an Emacs
window. One problem with doing this sort of thing properly is that,
unlike most versions of Common Lisp, Elisp isn't (yet?)
multi-threaded. I have a feeling that it would take a lot of work to
convert it. One thing that might be possible is to build a clone of
Elisp on top of Common Lisp I don't know how efficient that would
be. But it would require that all Elisp code works in a
lexical-binding environment. If it could be done you would get
multi-threading for free and such things as the clx library for
manipulating X.
