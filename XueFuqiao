== About Me ==

Welcome to my homepage!

I use Emacs.  My name is Xue Fuqiao.  I am known as [::xfq] on Freenode.  I was born in
Xinjiang, China.  Feel free to ask anything about
Emacs :)

Many thanks to the people who contributed or are contributing to
emacsen and EmacsWiki.  My daily life becomes very interesting.

You can contact me using (please send plain text mail, not HTML):

== Some Sentences I Like ==
* There is no system but GNU, and Linux is one of its kernels.

* I could have made money this way, and perhaps amused myself writing code. But I knew that at the end of my career, I would look back on years of building walls to divide people, and feel I had spent my life making the world a worse place.

* It is a logical impossibility to make a language more powerful by omitting features, no matter how bad they may be.  -- [[WikiPedia:John_Hughes_(computer_scientist)|John Hughes]]

== Wish List==
* Implement a search engine in EmacsLisp.
* Port XWindowEmacsManager to Emacs.
* Implement an FTP server in EmacsLisp.
* Implement a URL Shortener in EmacsLisp.
* Make Emacs/W3 be able to deal with HTML5.
* Implement a DOM binding for EmacsLisp.
* Make Emacs/W3 be able to parse XSL.
* Make Emacs support more image formats.
* Make the face code to be simpler, clearer and faster.
* Implement a EmacsLisp library that generates XPMs dynamically.

It looks like you have a lot of work to do! It may be worth looking at
the clx package for Common Lisp to see if it could be ported to
Elisp. It would be cool to be able to display an X-window in an Emacs
window. One problem with doing this sort of thing properly is that,
unlike most versions of Common Lisp, Elisp isn't (yet?)
multi-threaded. I have a feeling that it would take a lot of work to
convert it. One thing that might be possible is to build a clone of
Elisp on top of Common Lisp I don't know how efficient that would
be. But it would require that all Elisp code works in a
lexical-binding environment. If it could be done you would get
multi-threading for free and such things as the clx library for
manipulating X.

this is actually already possible with an Emacs branch, see EmacsXWidgets
