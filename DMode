The [http://www.wikiservice.at/d/wiki.cgi?EditorSupport/EmacsEditor EmacsEditor] page at the [http://www.wikiservice.at/d/wiki.cgi?FrontPage Wiki4D] site contains a link to a newer major mode (purported to work with 22.x onwards), as well as tips on integrating the D compiler further with Emacs.

== d-mode.el (based on cc-mode 5.3x) ==

* http://www.prowiki.org/wiki4d/wiki.cgi?EditorSupport/EmacsDMode

This version works with Emacs22.  It will also work with Emacs21 after upgrading cc-mode (http://cc-mode.sourceforge.net).

== Older d-mode.el (based on cc-mode 5.28) ==

* http://home.comcast.net/~benhinkle/d-mode.zip

This version works on Emacs21, but does not work on Emacs22 (because Emacs22 comes with cc-mode 5.31).
