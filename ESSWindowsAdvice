== MS Windows Users: Get Started with Emacs, ESS, and R ==

I've been advising Windows users and setting up Windows systems this
week, and before I forget I need to write down what 
I've learned.  There are a few little details that people miss.

1. Install R from http://www.r-project.org.  If you let R install itself
into the folder it likes (##C:\Program Files\R##), 
your life may be easier later on.  (I say that even though I hate
directories with spaces in them.)

I usually have a reasonably current copy of that at
http://pj.freefaculty.org/software/WinProgs, but  you can always go 
to the source for the latest and greatest.

After you install R, you have the problem of installing additional
packages from CRAN.  I have a script called 
<code>R_InstallFaves-2.R</code> that I run inside R.  It downloads a ton of packages.
If you don't know how to run that inside R, 
then I'd suggest you either paste the whole program into an open R
session or use the source() function inside R.  Maybe 
you could wait and do that after you have completed the rest of the
steps here.

2. Install the newest version of Professor Goulet's Emacs modified for
Windows. His page is 
http://vgoulet.act.ulaval.ca/en/ressources/emacs/. It has ESS (Emacs
Speaks Statistics) setup inside there, along with 
other handy Emacs addons.  Professor Goulet's effort to package all of
that amazes me.

I keep a copy of that at http://pj.freefaculty.org/software/WinProgs

Inside the Emacs installation, notice there is a bin directory with a
program called "addpm.exe".  Run that to add known 
file types to your Windows Registry.

3. Get my customized startup configuration file for Emacs

http://pj.freefaculty.org/stat/ps706/50emacs-ess-ku.el

Install that in your Emacs folder. It MUST go under
site-lisp/site.start.d. It won't work if you put it anywhere else.

In case I change my web host, perhaps it is wise to just show you what I have:

<pre>
;;Set up emacs-ess for Emacs with other things we like at KU.
;;;;;
;;;;;; This file is automatically loaded by emacs's site-start.el
;;;;;; when you start a new emacs session.
;;;

(setq use-file-dialog nil)

(require 'pc-select)
(pc-selection-mode)
(custom-set-variables
 '(cua-mode t nil (cua-base))
 '(show-paren-mode t)
 '(text-mode-hook (quote (turn-on-auto-fill text-mode-hook-identify)))
 '(transient-mark-mode t))

;;;
(setq inferior-ess-own-frame t)
(setq inferior-ess-same-window nil)
;;;
;;;;;create a new frame for each help instance
;;;
(setq ess-help-own-frame t)
;;;;;If you want all help
;;;;; buffers to go into one frame do:
;;;
(setq ess-help-own-frame 'one)

(setq ess-ask-for-ess-directory nil)
(setq ess-local-process-name "R")

(setq split-window-preferred-function nil)

 (setq ansi-color-for-comint-mode 'filter)
  (setq comint-prompt-read-only t)
  (setq comint-scroll-to-bottom-on-input t)
  (setq comint-scroll-to-bottom-on-output t)
  (setq comint-move-point-for-output t)

(defun my-ess-eval ()
  (interactive)
  (if (and transient-mark-mode mark-active)
        (call-interactively 'ess-eval-region)
    (call-interactively 'ess-eval-line-and-step)))

(add-hook 'ess-mode-hook
          '(lambda()
             (local-set-key [(shift return)] 'my-ess-eval)))


;; http://fuhm.livejournal.com/
;; This hack removes the really annoying splash screen that emacs22
;; now displays by default, even when you're trying to edit a buffer.
;;
(defadvice command-line-normalize-file-name
      (before kill-stupid-startup-screen activate)
  (setq inhibit-startup-screen t))

</pre>


This has many features that will help a Windows user who is picking up
Emacs for the first time. As of 2010-02-10, that 
startup file is vital because it prevents you from hitting bugs that
make Emacs FAIL when interacting with ESS. I'm told 
future versions of Emacs will fix the problem (associated with the file
chooser).

That configuration file also has a convenient shortcut.  In a line of
code, the key combination SHIFT-Return
will send a command over to the open R buffer.

In particular, the changes I recommend for new Emacs users are intended to 
make Emacs behave like an ordinary Windows program, so it 

   - does not use horizontal splits

   - opens R in a new separate frame

   - starts R help items in separate frames

   - uses the mouse to select regions in the usual Windows way

   - uses Control-x, Control-v in the Windows way

   - blocks the use of the *buggy* windows file chooser, instead preferring the Emacs minibar at the bottom

   - stops the Emacs frame from overlapping the start menu when Emacs starts

4. Here's the *best way* to get started writing R programs in Emacs for
Windows.

Create a new folder where you want to do your work. In my systems, it is
a hierarchy like 
<pre>
C:\users\pauljohn\pols\R\examples
</pre>
but you can do whatever you like. It
is best to NOT use spaces in your names here. 
Win 2000 and XP screwed us over by putting user homes under "Documents
and Settings", so I create a folder on C where I 
keep my work.  Win7 and Vista use ##C:\Users##, which is OK, since it has no
spaces.

Download an example R file from my page and put it into the directory
you just created. I would urge you to try this one:

http://pj.freefaculty.org/stat/ps706/barplot.R

I suppose you are using the Windows Explorer to create the folder and
suppose you are looking at the folder where you 
put barplot.R. That barplot.R is truly a masterpiece :), but in case you
can't find it, any R code will do. If you have never used R, take this and
put it in a file.

<pre>
x <- rpois(10, lambda=10)
mynames <- c(rep("Really Long Name",9),"Really Long Name Long Long")
barplot(x)
</pre>



RIGHT click on that file.  We want to open it in GNU Emacs, not with
some other program that Windows might suggest. So, 
when you RIGHT click, choose "open with" and if there is no option GNU
Emacs, then browse, go find your Emacs install 
directory, look under "bin", and choose the file "runemacs.exe".  Don't
choose "emacs.exe". DO choose "runemacs.exe".

Emacs will open with barplot.R in front of you. There are many ways to
start the R session, such as

1. Alt-x R

2. Click the big blue R in the toolbar.

3. Try to execute any line in barplot.R (Shift-Enter)

The customized emacs startup file I recommend tells R it should start in
the current working directory, so once the R 
buffer is visible, type this command to make sure:
<pre>
> getwd()
</pre>
you should see that R is using your folder as its working space. That
means it will write files there and it will look 
for input files there by default.
