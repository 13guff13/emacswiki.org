== History Enhancements ==

This page is about accessing and reusing previous input that you have typed in the [[minibuffer]].


[:Which]
=== What Input, What History? ===

First, what is meant by "'''input'''" and "input history"?  In Emacs and
in this doc, "'''minibuffer history'''" and "'''input history'''" generally
refer to input that you have typed (or [[Icicles - Cycling Completions|cycled]] or [[completion|completed]]) in the
minibuffer and then ''entered'' using '''`RET'''' (or `S-RET').  Emacs
provides different history lists for this, depending on the kind
of input.  The most general such list is the value of [[variable]]
`minibuffer-history'.

But what about input that you type in the minibuffer (e.g. during completion) but that you ''do not
enter'' with `RET'?  That is not recorded in any standard history
list, so you cannot recall it using `M-p' and `M-n'.

The '''Icicles''' doc speaks ambiguously of "'''minibuffer input'''".  This
always refers to something that you type in the minibuffer, but
sometimes it means input that you enter with `RET' and sometimes
it does not.  The context and the use
of phrases such as "entered" and "entered with `RET'" should make
clear what is meant.  Input that you type during completion but you do not necessarily enter is sometimes referred to in the '''Icicles''' doc as "'''completion input'''".

Because ''completion'' is so important to '''Icicles''', because ''[[Icicles - Cycling Completions|cycling]]''
replaces the input you type in the minibuffer, and because you sometimes
need to retrieve such typed ''input that was never entered'', '''Icicles'''
also records this input.  You can retrieve it during completion
using '''`C-l'''' ('''`icicle-retrieve-previous-input'''') and `C-S-l', that
is, '''`C-L'''', ('''`icicle-retrieve-next-input'''').  Use these [[command]]s to
cycle among your past completion inputs (backward and forward,
respectively).

User [[option]] '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-completion-history-max-length|icicle-completion-history-max-length]]</tt>''''
limits the number of completion inputs to save. 

If you customize user option '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-C-l-uses-completion-flag|icicle-C-l-uses-completion-flag]]</tt>'''' to
non-`nil', then, instead of cycling, `C-l' lets you use '''Icicles'''
completion to retrieve a past completion input (`##C-##'''##L##'''' does the
same thing).  Using completion to retrieve a past input does not
also ''choose'' that input as the candidate for the main completion;
it just replaces your current minibuffer input with it.  Because
`C-l' completion uses a recursive minibuffer, you can also use
`C-g' to cancel this completion and return to the main completion.

You can temporarily reverse the effect of
`icicle-C-l-uses-completion-flag' by using a [[prefix argument]]
(`C-u') with `C-l'.  Thus, `C-u C-l' uses completion if
`icicle-C-l-uses-completion-flag' is `nil' and cycles if it is non-`nil'.

The other sections on this page describe '''Icicles''' enhancements for
minibuffer histories.  They are thus concerned only with inputs
that you enter, not with completion inputs that are not entered.





[:Overview]
=== Overview of Minibuffer History Enhancements ===

'''Icicles''' enhances minibuffer history during completion in these independent ways:

[new]
[:MenuItemCommands]
'''1.''' Commands invoked using a [[menu bar]] menu are included in the
command history for '''`M-x''''.  This helps you quickly find again
and reuse a (possibly deep) menu item.  It lets you use
completion to access such commands.  And it helps you learn the
commands that correspond to menu items that you use, thus
providing a missing bridge between menu use and minibuffer use.

If you do not want to include menu-item commands in the command
history, then set option '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-menu-items-to-history-flag|icicle-menu-items-to-history-flag]]</tt>'''' to `nil'.

[:M-o]
'''2.''' Command '''`icicle-insert-history-element'''' (bound to '''`M-o'''' in the
minibuffer) lets you use ([[lax]]) completion to insert a history
element in the minibuffer.

[:HistoryFace]
'''3.''' Candidates displayed in `*Completions*' are highlighted using
   face `icicle-historical-candidate' (blue foreground, by
   default), when they have been used previously, so you can more
   easily recognize them.   This highlighting is controlled by
   option '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-highlight-historical-candidates-flag|icicle-highlight-historical-candidates-flag]]</tt>''''.  You can
   toggle this from the minibuffer at any time using `C-pause'.

[:HistorySorting]
'''4.''' Command '''`icicle-toggle-alternative-sorting'''' ('''`##C-M-,##'''' in the 
   minibuffer) re-sorts completion candidates, 
   placing previously used candidates first.  This is a toggle: repeat it 
   to return to the original order.

[:M-pause]
'''5.''' Command '''`icicle-keep-only-past-inputs'''' ('''`M-pause'''' in the
   minibuffer) restricts the current set of completion candidates
   to those that you have used previously.  In other words, it
   keeps only those candidates that are highlighted in blue.  To
   use `M-pause', you must first have used `TAB' or `S-TAB' to
   establish an explicit candidate set.  If you use `C-u M-pause',
   then the previously used candidates are ordered
   chronologically, most recent first.  Without `C-u', the normal
   sort order is used (`icicle-sort-comparer').

[:M-h]
'''6.''' Command '''`icicle-history'''' ('''`M-h'''' in the minibuffer) matches the
   current input against the minibuffer history directly.  It can
   be used during completion.

[:C-M-pause]
'''7.''' Command '''`icicle-other-history'''' ('''`C-M-pause'''' in the minibuffer)
lets you use a different history for the current completion.  You can choose the history using completion.

[:M-i]
'''8.''' Commands '''`icicle-clear-history'''' and '''`icicle-clear-current-history'''' ('''`M-i'''' in the minibuffer) provide a general way to clean up histories.

[:M-k]
'''9.''' When you cycle among previously entered inputs using `M-p' and
`M-n', you can use '''`M-k'''' (command '''`icicle-erase-minibuffer-or-history-element'''') to delete the current occurrence from the history list.  This is a quick and handy way to clean up list entries that you are no longer interested in.  Only the occurrence that you have cycled to is deleted; if there are identical entries elsewhere in the history, they remain.
[new]

Some of these enhancements are described below in more detail. Each of 1-7 lets you see the complete list of
previous inputs that match your current input.  In vanilla Emacs,
the history lists are never shown as such; you can access previous
inputs only one at a time, in order (with `M-p').  In vanilla
Emacs, you can use a [[regexp]] to search the history list (via
`M-r'), but the regexp matching is not dynamic, and the first
match found is the (only) one you get.

Displaying previous inputs that match the current input sounds
like a minor advantage, but it is actually quite helpful in
practice.  Among other things, it means that you can work with
''long'' history lists in a practical way.





[:icicle-insert-history-element]
[:InsertPreviousInputs]
=== Using Completion to Insert Previous Inputs: `M-o' ===

Unlike the other minibuffer history enhancements, described below,
which are available only during minibuffer completion, you can use
'''`M-o'''' (`icicle-insert-history-element') anytime you are asked for minibuffer input.  It provides a
recursive minibuffer in which you can match a previous input using
completion.  After you hit `RET' to accept your choice, it is
inserted in the minibuffer just as if you had typed it.  This is a form of on-demand completion (see [[Icicles - Completion On Demand]]), and as such is always available.

This has
the advantage over cycling with `M-n' or `M-p' and searching with
`M-s' or `M-r', that you can use '''Icicles''' completion and cycling to
quickly access a previous input, no matter how long ago you
entered it.

When completion is available for reading input, if you use `M-o'
to choose a previously entered input, this just inserts that input
in the minibuffer.  What is in the minibuffer after you use `M-o'
is not automatically chosen for the main completion -- you can edit
the minibuffer contents before entering it with `RET'.  You can
also use `C-g' during the `M-o' completion to cancel it and return
to the main completion.





[:icicle-toggle-alternative-sorting]
[:SortPreviousFirst]
=== Putting Previous Candidates First: `C-M-,' ===

At any time,  two of the '''Icicles''' sort orders are immediately available.  These are the values of user options
'''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-sort-comparer|icicle-sort-comparer]]</tt>'''' and '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-alternative-sort-comparer|icicle-alternative-sort-comparer]]</tt>''''.  By
default, the former sorts alphabetically, and the latter puts all
previously used inputs first, before the candidates you have not
yet used.  Each of these groups, used and unused candidates, is then 
sorted alphabetically, separately.  So, with the default
alternative sort, you can see all matching candidates (used and
unused), but you privilege those used previously -- they are the
first listed in `*Completions*' and the first available for cycling.

If you prefer, by customizing these user options, you can use
`icicle-historical-alphabetic-p' as the main sort function (option
`icicle-sort-comparer') and some other sort function
(e.g. `icicle-case-string-less-p') as the alternative sort function.

You can toggle at any time between normal sorting and alternative
sorting, using command `icicle-toggle-alternative-sorting'.
During completion, this is bound to '''`##C-M-,##''''.  Together with
toggling between normal sorting and not sorting at all, which is
a sort-order choice available through'''`##C-,##'''', this gives you quite a lot of flexibility.  Some
commands, such as `icicle-complete-keys' (bound to `S-TAB' except
during completion), use different sort orders.





[:MatchHistoricalCandidates]
=== Matching Only Historical Candidates: `M-h' and `M-pause' ===

Both `M-h' and `M-pause' can be used toward the same end.  They
both work for all input types.  They both use the appropriate
history list for the current command.  They both provide [[apropos completion]] and cycling for the minibuffer history (as well as
[[prefix completion]], of course).  Use them as another way to search
through a history list or complete to one of its elements.

For example, If you use `C-x C-f' to find a file, and then use
`M-h' or `M-pause', the completion candidates will be the names of
files that you have previously accessed (file names you have input
in the minibuffer), and which match the current minibuffer input.

`M-h' lets you complete your input against the minibuffer input
history.  `M-pause' lets you ''restrict the current'' explicit set of
completion candidates to those that are also in the minibuffer
history.

They provide similar functionality in different ways.  The
difference is that `M-pause' takes the current set of matching
candidates into account.  It is a completion-candidates ''set''
operation, similar to those described in [[Icicles - Candidate Sets]].

This means, in particular, that with `M-pause' you can first
perform set operations on the set of candidates, and then use that
result to restrict the history search.  For example, you can first
complement the candidate set using `##C-~##', then use `M-pause' to
restrict those candidates to matches in the history list.  In this
way, you avoid including matches from the original match set when
searching the history.

Example: You are in a directory with lots of files that have the prefix `foo' and lots of C-language source files. You happen to be interested in another file, however. One way to get to that file is to use [[DiredMode|Dired]]'s ability to mark files by matching a regexp and then use Dired's ability to omit the marked files from view. You can scan through those that remain, and pick the one you want. However, it turns out that even then there are many files to scan. You accessed the one you want now just the other day, but the file date is unfortunately not significant.

In '''Icicles''', you use regexp matching and take the set complement of the hits, just like in Dired: `##C-x C-f foo.*\.c$##' defines the candidate set as all
files whose names start with `foo' and have extension `c'.  `##C-~##'
then defines the candidate set as all files whose names are ''not''
like that.  Finally, you use `M-pause' to restrict the file-name candidates to
names that you have used before. You've accessed many, many files recently, so just cycling through the history with `M-p' would be tedious. You could match a regexp against the file history, but how can you come up with a regexp that finds ''anti''-matches?

A consequence of this difference between `M-h' and `M-pause' is that using `TAB' or `S-TAB'
after `M-pause' abandons use of the minibuffer history and starts
a new set of completion candidates.  It simply completes the
current input in the context of the current command; `TAB' and
`S-TAB' have nothing to do with the minibuffer history in this
case.  Using `TAB' or `S-TAB' after `M-h', however, re-completes
your input against the current history list.

Another consequence is that you can use `down' or `C-down' on the candidates
displayed by `M-h', but not on those displayed by `M-pause'.  For
example, to cycle through the doc for each variable that starts
with `icicle-' which you have previously input, you can use `##C-h v
icicle- M-h##', then repeatedly use `C-down'.

Also, file-name and directory-name completion works differently in
these two commands.  By default, the current directory is (as
always) inserted into the minibuffer by commands such as
`find-file', so either `M-h' or `M-pause' after `C-x C-f' will
match previously input file names from the current directory. However, in the case of `M-h', the entire minibuffer input is
matched against the history list, which is a list of absolute file
names.  `M-pause' works only with the current candidate set,
which, if you have already used `TAB' or `S-TAB' in the current
directory, is a set of relative file names in that directory.

This difference has a consequence for apropos (regexp) completion
with `M-h'.  It means that to match a file name using a substring
you must, in the minibuffer, either not specify a directory (erase
it) or explicitly use `##.*##' before the file-name substring. For example, with `M-h', `/foo/bar/lph' will not apropos-match the
previously input file name `##/foo/bar/alphabet-soup.el##'; you should
use either `##/foo/bar/.*lph##' or `lph' (no directory).

In the case of `M-pause', however, the input is matched against
the history list as restricted by the existing completion list.
And, since apropos file-name completion uses only the relative
file name, without the directory name, as a regexp, the candidate
list that is restricted has already matched the input regexp.  The
action of `M-pause' is simply to filter the list of candidates,
keeping those that are in the history list.  This means that, with
`M-pause', the input `/foo/bar/lph' will match against the
previously input file name `##/foo/bar/alphabet-soup.el##'.

If this all sounds confusing, just give it a try; it is much
harder to describe than it is to experience.





[:UsingOtherHistories]
=== Using Other Histories; Commands Any Which Way ===

This section describes how to complete your input against a
history other than the default history provided for the current
command.  A special case of this, starting with Emacs 23, is
completing a command, abbrev, or keyboard macro name against all
such that were previously executed in any interactive way.  This
includes commands invoked using a menu.




[:C-M-pause]
[:icicle-other-history]
==== Completing Against All Interactive Commands ====

When you execute a command using `M-x', it is added to the history
`extended-command-history'.  Likewise, when you execute a command
or abbrev using `icicle-command-abbrev-command'.  And when you
execute a keyboard macro using `C-x M-e'
(`icicle-execute-named-keyboard-macro'), it is added to history
`icicle-kmacro-history'.

However, when you execute a command, abbrev, or keyboard macro in
other ways than these, it is not added to such a history.  For
example, if you choose a ''menu'' item, the
associated command is not added to any of these histories.  Thus,
although `M-o' lets you complete against previously used commands,
this does not include commands that were called via a menu item.

To remedy this, starting with Emacs 23 '''Icicles''' can optionally add all commands that are called using
`call-interactively' to the larger command history
'''`icicle-interactive-history''''.  This includes commands on menus.
To enable this feature, you must
customize option '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-populate-interactive-history-flag|icicle-populate-interactive-history-flag]]</tt>'''', to
make it non-`nil'.  Thereafter, when you enter ''Icicle'' mode, all
interactive use of commands records them on this special history.

During completion, you can then use '''`C-M-pause''''
('''`icicle-other-history'''') to complete against this extended set of
previously used commands.  For example, if you use menu item '''Open File''', then the corresponding
command, `menu-find-file-existing', becomes available as a completion
candidate.  (Recall too that the command associated with a given
menu item is shown in the `*Completions*' [[mode line]] whenever you cycle
to it.)

Be aware that use of this feature can slow Emacs down, and the
history list can become quite large.




==== Using an Alternative History ====

When you are completing something other than a command, abbrev, or
[[keyboard macro]] (or even when you complete one of those, if you use
a prefix argument), `C-M-pause' prompts you for an alternative
history to use -- any history you like.  You can choose the history using completion.  This
does not automatically complete your current input against the history you
choose; it simply changes the current history for the duration of
the current minibuffer completion.  (You can use `M-h', as usual,
if you want to complete against the chosen history.)





[:ClearHistoryEntries]
=== Cleaning Up History Lists ===

Besides the use of `M-k' during history cycling (`M-p', `M-n') to
remove individual input occurrences from the current history list,
you can use commands '''`icicle-clear-history'''' and
'''`icicle-clear-current-history'''' to clean minibuffer histories
entirely of selected entries.  Command
`icicle-clear-current-history' is bound to '''`M-i'''' in the
minibuffer.  It is `icicle-clear-history' specialized to work on
just the current history list.

These commands prompt you for a history entry to delete from a
history list.  These are [[multi-command]]s, so you can delete
multiple entries.  For each entry you choose, all of its
occurrences are deleted from the history.

Command `icicle-clear-history' first prompts you for a history
list to act on.  This too is multi-command input, so you can use
`icicle-clear-history' to remove entries from multiple histories.

If you use a [[prefix argument]] with these commands, then the
histories are emptied entirely (upon confirmation).  Thus, for
instance, you can use `C-u M-i' at any time during minibuffer
input to completely empty the current history list.

'''See Also:''' [[Icicles - More About Multi-Commands]] for information about
using `S-delete' to delete objects associated with completion candidates.
