I am [[jfm3]], and I approve this Wiki page.

In 1989, I went to work for a company called Unipress Software on a commercial product called Unipress Emacs. I learned after several years that GNU Emacs was better because the license made it so.  More people were working on it, and those people were users who cared.  Eventually I came to feel that selling NASA and other important world technology leaders something so obviously inferior was morally objectionable. I started using GNU Emacs to develop Unipress Emacs in 1991. I left Unipress around 1994.

In 1997 I went to work for Rutgers University. Around 1998 I decided that it was foolish to force information to behave like tangible property, and that copyright law had not only drifted far from it's original spirit (which was always obvious to me) but that the direction in which it was drifting was (and is) morally reprehensible. I eliminated as much non-free software from my life as possible. The occasional bit of firmware for the microwave oven still happens, but the amount seems to diminish every year.

Disgusted with most of the "Desktop" software I have to use to read email, plan my schedule, chat, etc., In late 2003 I started looking around for a platform to build a bunch of simple applications for myself. Everything I came across was either way to complicated and heavyweight, or had around two developers. In February of 2004, I rediscovered GNU Emacs, this time as an application platform. I now do everything I possibly can in emacs. This includes

* BbdbMode
* TrampMode
* EmacsIRCClient (with bitlbee)
* [[Gnus]]
* OrgMode
* WThreeM

I also run firefox and all that hoo-ha.

My music collection is in Ogg Vorbis format, thank you.

I have never run xemacs, nor have I developed an opinion on the politics of the matter.
