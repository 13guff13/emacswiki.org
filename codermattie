In the course of maintaining my creeping Emacs configuration I am factoring
the least idiosyncratic bits from my configuration and posting them. I hope others may derive some
benefit from reading or using my forays in Emacs.

Here is a bit of code that automatically kills the buffer after a process exits.

<pre>

(defun run-hooks-with-arg ( hook-list &rest args )
  "run the hook list with arg"
  (mapc
    (lambda ( hook )
      (apply hook args))
      hook-list))

;; setup a hook that runs when the term process exits
(defvar term-process-exit-hook nil
  "a hook run when the term process exists")

;; infect the term-sentinel function
(defadvice term-sentinel (around term-sentinel-hook (proc msg))
  (let
    ((pbuffer (process-buffer proc))
     (did-exit (memq (process-status proc) '(signal exit))))
    ad-do-it
    (when did-exit (run-hooks-with-arg term-process-exit-hook pbuffer)) ))

;; get rid of the buffer when the process exits
(add-hook 'term-process-exit-hook (lambda ( pbuffer )
                                    (kill-buffer pbuffer)))

(ad-activate 'term-sentinel)
</pre>

To get keybindings right execute this function. When you enter the key sequence it will generate
the (kbd) call in the buffer. handy for executing after (local-set-key _here_

<pre>
(defun insert-key-notation ()
  "inject a complete \(kbd \"sequence\"\) with key notation for a key sequence given by prompt"
  (interactive)
  (insert "(kbd \"")
  (insert (format-kbd-macro (read-key-sequence "Key? " nil t)))
  (insert "\")"))
</pre>
