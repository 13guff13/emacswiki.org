The code below is a hack to integrate Eshell and [[bookmark]]s, for changing directories. This could be integrated into eshell/cd (using a prefix like `:' in a similar way to how `=' can be used) but it was easier, especially considering completion, to create a new command. There is most certain room for enhancements and fixes, but it works quite well as it is. -- MaDa
