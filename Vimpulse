'''Vimpulse''' extends [ViperMode Viper] with Vim features like Visual mode and text objects.

: '''Latest release: [[vimpulse.el|Vimpulse 0.4]]''' (always on !EmacsWiki)

If you want bleeding edge, you can [http://www.assembla.com/spaces/vimpulse/trac_git_tool clone the Git repository].

== Installation ==

Place ##vimpulse.el## somewhere in your ##load-path##. Then add the following
to your init file:

    (require 'vimpulse)

If you want linear undo/redo, download and install [http://wonderworks.com/download/redo.el redo.el] (included with XEmacs).

Vimpulse automatically enables [ViperMode Viper]. You can temporarily disable Viper (and Vimpulse) with `C-z'.

== News ==

* By popular request, we have moved to [http://www.assembla.com/spaces/vimpulse/trac_git_tool Git] as our version control system.
* Emacs-compatible Visual selection (normal, line and block).
* New keys: `C-o', `C-i', `C-w hjkl', `gb', `gd', `gq', `gu', `gU', `g~', `g?', `+', `_'.
* Modal keybinding functions: `vimpulse-map', `vimpulse-imap', `vimpulse-vmap' and `vimpulse-omap'.
* Operator-Pending mode: framework for defining new operator commands and text objects.

I am logged in (as alexey_r), but can't create a ticket there:

> 403 Forbidden (TICKET_CREATE privileges are required to perform this operation)

Anyway, the ticket I wanted to create is an enhancement request to add hlsearch. One possible solution can be found at http://r4yner.wordpress.com/2008/09/19/hlsearch-for-emacs/

Well, the interface seems to suck somehow (I didn't investigate): when I tried
to create a ticket, a login dialog popped up, and when I entered the same
login information as with my Assembla account, I could create a ticket (i.e.,
you have to kinda log in twice). Does that not work for you either (I'm a
project member, so maybe I have some extra privileges, no idea)?

Anyway, I personally prefer the mailing list, which does not even require
subscription, so you're most welcome to post to that (see the links on this
page).

Regarding hlsearch, I'm not sure I would support such addition, as there seems
to be a lot of equivalent functionality in Emacs; but Vimpulse is apparently
still supposed to emulate Vim ;-), so it's possible Vegard's opinion might
differ. Again, the mailing list might be a better place for such a discussion.

No, it doesn't work. It seems you do have to be a member to create a ticket.
