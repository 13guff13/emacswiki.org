[[Evil]] will be the successor to [[Vimpulse]] [https://lists.ourproject.org/pipermail/implementations-list/2011-April/000756.html] and to [[VimMode]]

'''Vimpulse''' extends [ViperMode Viper] with Vim features like Visual mode and text objects.

: '''Latest release: [[vimpulse.el|Vimpulse 0.5]]''' (always on !EmacsWiki)

If you want bleeding edge, you can clone the [http://gitorious.org/vimpulse/vimpulse Git repository]:

    git clone git://gitorious.org/vimpulse/vimpulse.git

== Installation ==

Place ##vimpulse.el## somewhere in your ##load-path##. Then add the following
to your init file:

    (require 'vimpulse)

If you want linear undo/redo, download and install UndoTree.

Vimpulse automatically enables [ViperMode Viper]. You can temporarily disable Viper (and Vimpulse) with `C-z'.

== News ==

== History ==

Vimpulse prehistory started with [http://common-lisp.net/project/vial/darcs/extended-viper/ extended-viper], by Brad Beveridge. Alessandro Piras took extended-viper and enhanced it into a codebase called vimper, which isn't available online.

Vimpulse history began when Jason Spiro split vimper into two parts to make two projects: viper-in-more-modes 0.1 and Vimpulse 0.1.

Jason was maintainer of Vimpulse from 0.1 (May 2007) until he passed the maintainership on. Alessandro inherited the maintainership from him in June 2009.[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.vim-emulation/39] Vegard Ã˜ye inherited it from Alessandro in April 2010.[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.vim-emulation/309]
