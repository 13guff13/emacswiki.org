'''Vimpulse''' extends [ViperMode Viper] with Vim features like Visual mode and text objects.

: '''Latest release: [[vimpulse.el|Vimpulse 0.5]]''' (always on !EmacsWiki)

If you want bleeding edge, you can clone the [http://gitorious.org/vimpulse/vimpulse Git repository]:

    git clone git://gitorious.org/vimpulse/vimpulse.git

== Installation ==

Place ##vimpulse.el## somewhere in your ##load-path##. Then add the following
to your init file:

    (require 'vimpulse)

If you want linear undo/redo, download and install UndoTree.

Vimpulse automatically enables [ViperMode Viper]. You can temporarily disable Viper (and Vimpulse) with `C-z'.

== News ==

* By popular request, we have moved to [http://gitorious.org/vimpulse/vimpulse Git] as our version control system.

=== Proposal for Vim's "insert character above/below cursor" ===

Hi, I just wrote a small function to emulate Vim's i_CTRL_E and i_CTRL_Y. Please feel free to use it, change the names, or not use it. The code is here: http://gist.github.com/834957

Cheers!
