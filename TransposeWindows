When working with multiple windows it can be annoying if they get out of order. With this function it's easy to fix that. This is a slight rewrite of an original written by ThomasBellman.

 (defun transpose-windows (arg)
   "Transpose the buffers shown in two windows."
   (interactive "p")
   (let ((selector (if (>= arg 0) 'next-window 'previous-window)))
     (while (/= arg 0)
       (let ((this-win (window-buffer))
             (next-win (window-buffer (funcall selector))))
         (set-window-buffer (selected-window) next-win)
         (set-window-buffer (funcall selector) this-win)
         (select-window (funcall selector)))
       (setq arg (if (plusp arg) (1- arg) (1+ arg))))))

 (define-key ctl-x-4-map (kbd "t") 'transpose-windows)

And because diversity is a good thing, here is Stephen Gildea's
version of the same:

 (defun swap-window-positions ()         ; Stephen Gildea
   "*Swap the positions of this window and the next one."
   (interactive)
   (let ((other-window (next-window (selected-window) 'no-minibuf)))
     (let ((other-window-buffer (window-buffer other-window))
           (other-window-hscroll (window-hscroll other-window))
           (other-window-point (window-point other-window))
           (other-window-start (window-start other-window)))
       (set-window-buffer other-window (current-buffer))
       (set-window-hscroll other-window (window-hscroll (selected-window)))
       (set-window-point other-window (point))
       (set-window-start other-window (window-start (selected-window)))
       (set-window-buffer (selected-window) other-window-buffer)
       (set-window-hscroll (selected-window) other-window-hscroll)
       (set-window-point (selected-window) other-window-point)
       (set-window-start (selected-window) other-window-start))
     (select-window other-window)))

ChrisWebber provides a similar function, but this one allows you to select which two you want to swap (perhaps if you have 3 or more windows open)

 (setq swapping-buffer nil)
 (setq swapping-window nil)

 (defun swap-buffers-in-windows ()
   "Swap buffers between two windows"
   (interactive)
   (if (and swapping-window
            swapping-buffer)
       (let ((this-buffer (current-buffer))
             (this-window (selected-window)))
         (if (and (window-live-p swapping-window)
                  (buffer-live-p swapping-buffer))
             (progn (switch-to-buffer swapping-buffer)
                    (select-window swapping-window)
                    (switch-to-buffer this-buffer)
                    (select-window this-window)
                    (message "Swapped buffers."))
           (message "Old buffer/window killed.  Aborting."))
         (setq swapping-buffer nil)
         (setq swapping-window nil))
     (progn
       (setq swapping-buffer (current-buffer))
       (setq swapping-window (selected-window))
       (message "Buffer and window marked for swapping."))))

 (global-set-key (kbd "C-c p") 'swap-buffers-in-windows)

Yet another window-altering function by Robert Bost slightly based on Steve Yegge's swap-windows. This one will handle > 1 windows.  

 (defun rotate-windows ()
  "Rotate your windows" (interactive) (cond ((not (> (count-windows) 1)) (message "You can't rotate a sinlge window!"))
 (t
  (setq i 1)
  (setq numWindows (count-windows))
  (while  (< i numWindows)
    (let* (
           (w1 (elt (window-list) i))
           (w2 (elt (window-list) (+ (% i numWindows) 1)))

           (b1 (window-buffer w1))
           (b2 (window-buffer w2))

           (s1 (window-start w1))
           (s2 (window-start w2))
           )
      (set-window-buffer w1  b2)
      (set-window-buffer w2 b1)
      (set-window-start w1 s2)
      (set-window-start w2 s1)
      (setq i (1+ i)))))))
