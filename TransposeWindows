When working with multiple windows it can be annoying if they get out of order.

If you have 2 windows and want to swap the top buffer with the bottom, you could use the sequence of seven keys, `C-x 0 C-x 4 b'.  More likely you are in the bottom buffer and want to be on top.  In that case, use `C-x 0 C-x 2 C-x b RET'. (Note that these don't handle the case where the window is split ''vertically'' instead of horizontally.)

Alternatively, a simple function could be written in Lisp and assigned to a single key sequence.  This is a slight rewrite of an original written by ThomasBellman.

 (defun transpose-windows (arg)
   "Transpose the buffers shown in two windows."
   (interactive "p")
   (let ((selector (if (>= arg 0) 'next-window 'previous-window)))
     (while (/= arg 0)
       (let ((this-win (window-buffer))
             (next-win (window-buffer (funcall selector))))
         (set-window-buffer (selected-window) next-win)
         (set-window-buffer (funcall selector) this-win)
         (select-window (funcall selector)))
       (setq arg (if (plusp arg) (1- arg) (1+ arg))))))

 (define-key ctl-x-4-map (kbd "t") 'transpose-windows)

And because diversity is a good thing, here is Stephen Gildea's
version of the same:

 (defun swap-window-positions ()         ; Stephen Gildea
   "*Swap the positions of this window and the next one."
   (interactive)
   (let ((other-window (next-window (selected-window) 'no-minibuf)))
     (let ((other-window-buffer (window-buffer other-window))
           (other-window-hscroll (window-hscroll other-window))
           (other-window-point (window-point other-window))
           (other-window-start (window-start other-window)))
       (set-window-buffer other-window (current-buffer))
       (set-window-hscroll other-window (window-hscroll (selected-window)))
       (set-window-point other-window (point))
       (set-window-start other-window (window-start (selected-window)))
       (set-window-buffer (selected-window) other-window-buffer)
       (set-window-hscroll (selected-window) other-window-hscroll)
       (set-window-point (selected-window) other-window-point)
       (set-window-start (selected-window) other-window-start))
     (select-window other-window)))

Here is a simpler function:

 (defun transpose-windows ()
   "Transpose two windows.  If more or less than two windows are visible, error."
   (interactive)
   (unless (= 2 (count-windows))
     (error "There are not 2 windows."))
   (let* ((windows (window-list))
          (w1 (car windows))
          (w2 (nth 1 windows))
          (w1b (window-buffer w1))
          (w2b (window-buffer w2)))
     (set-window-buffer w1 w2b)
     (set-window-buffer w2 w1b)))

ChrisWebber provides a similar function, but this one allows you to select which two you want to swap (perhaps if you have 3 or more windows open)

 (setq swapping-buffer nil)
 (setq swapping-window nil)

 (defun swap-buffers-in-windows ()
   "Swap buffers between two windows"
   (interactive)
   (if (and swapping-window
            swapping-buffer)
       (let ((this-buffer (current-buffer))
             (this-window (selected-window)))
         (if (and (window-live-p swapping-window)
                  (buffer-live-p swapping-buffer))
             (progn (switch-to-buffer swapping-buffer)
                    (select-window swapping-window)
                    (switch-to-buffer this-buffer)
                    (select-window this-window)
                    (message "Swapped buffers."))
           (message "Old buffer/window killed.  Aborting."))
         (setq swapping-buffer nil)
         (setq swapping-window nil))
     (progn
       (setq swapping-buffer (current-buffer))
       (setq swapping-window (selected-window))
       (message "Buffer and window marked for swapping."))))

 (global-set-key (kbd "C-c p") 'swap-buffers-in-windows)

Yet another window-altering function by Robert Bost slightly based on Steve Yegge's swap-windows and further modified by Collin Doering and others. This one will handle > 1 windows.  
It also accepts a prefix argument which rotates the other direction. Additionally given a numeric prefix argument n, it will rotate the windows n times; if the numeric argument is negative rotates |n| times in the other direction.
{{{
(defun rotate-windows (arg)
  "Rotate your windows; use the prefix argument to rotate the other direction"
  (interactive "P")
  (if (not (> (count-windows) 1))
      (message "You can't rotate a single window!")
    (let* ((rotate-times (prefix-numeric-value arg))
           (direction (if (or (< rotate-times 0) (equal arg '(4)))
                          'reverse 'identity)))
      (dotimes (_ (abs rotate-times))
        (dotimes (i (- (count-windows) 1))
          (let* ((w1 (elt (funcall direction (window-list)) i))
                 (w2 (elt (funcall direction (window-list)) (+ i 1)))

                 (s2 (window-start w2))
                 (p1 (window-point w1))
