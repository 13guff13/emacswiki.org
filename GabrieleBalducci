hello

here you can find Lisp:comment-edit.el, which allows to create and/or edit
shell-like (aka end-of-line) comments.

Comments are created/edited in a dedicated buffer which is popped up
when the comment-edit command is invoked; the user edits the comment
as ordinary text in the edit buffer; when finished, C-cC-c pops down
the edit buffer and copies back the text commented according to the
current comment style into the original buffer.

Details can be found in the commentary section of the source file.
