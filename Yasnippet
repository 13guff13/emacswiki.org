*YASnippet* is a template system for Emacs. It allows you to type an
abbreviation and automatically expand it into function
templates. Bundled language templates includes: C, C++, C#, Perl, Python, Ruby,
SQL, LaTeX, HTML, CSS and more. The snippet syntax is inspired from [http://manual.macromates.com/en/snippets TextMate's] syntax, you can even
[http://yasnippet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/snippet-development.html#importing-textmate-snippets import] most !TextMate templates to YASnippet. Watch [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj7btx3ATg Demo at YouTube].

====Install with yasnippet-bundle.el====
To quickly tryout YASnippet, download the a simpler "bundle" version. 
If you plan to work more with the bundled templates your own templates, 
download the "normal" package.
 
1. Download yasnippet-bundle.el tar gz and unpack it.

2. You'll get a file named `yasnippet-bundle.el`, put it in `~/.emacs.d/plugins/` (create that directory if not exists).

3. Open the file in Emacs, and type `Alt+x eval-buffer`.

That's it. Now, open any file, you'll see a menu "YASnippet".  You can
pull the menu to insert a template. Or, you can type a pre-defined
abbrev and press TAB to expand it!
 
To have Emacs load YASnippet automatically when it starts, put the following in your ~/.emacs file:
{{{
(add-to-list 'load-path
             "~/.emacs.d/plugins")
(require 'yasnippet-bundle)
}}}

====Normal install====
To install the normal archive, download and unpack the
latest yasnippet-x.y.z.tar.bz2. You'll get a directory named
yasnippet-x.y.z, put it in your ~/.emacs.d/plugins and add the following in
your .emacs file:
{{{
    (add-to-list 'load-path
                  "~/.emacs.d/plugins/yasnippet-x.y.z")
    (require 'yasnippet) ;; not yasnippet-bundle
    (yas/initialize)
    (yas/load-directory "~/.emacs.d/plugins/yasnippet-x.y.z/snippets")
}}}

====How-tos, Bugs, Contributions...====
Please refer to the comprehensive
[http://yasnippet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/index.html documentation] for full customization and support. If you found a bug, please report it at [http://code.google.com/p/yasnippet/issues/list issues list]. If you have a problem using YASnippet, or have template to contribute,

===Simplified Installation and Workarounds===
For full install of the normal archive, just download and unpack the latest [http://code.google.com/p/yasnippet/downloads/list yasnippet-x.y.z.tar.bz2]. You'll get a directory named `yasnippet, put it in
~/.emacs.d/plugins/ and add the following in your .emacs:

Lisp:yasnippet-config.el simplifies installation and it has some workarounds.

{{{
    (require 'yasnippet-config)
    (yas/setup "~/.emacs.d/plugins/yasnippet")
}}}

YASnippet has recently entered version 0.6.x. For this version many of the tweaks in Lisp:yasnippet-config.el are probably invalid or unnecessary. See the [http://yasnippet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/changelog.html changelog]
