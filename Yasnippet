== Description ==

*YASnippet* is a template system for Emacs. It allows you to type an
abbreviation and automatically expand it into function
templates. 

See what it looks like: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCGmZK4V7Sg.

Bundled language templates includes: C, C++, [CSharpMode C#], [PerlMode Perl], [PythonMode Python], [RubyMode Ruby],
[SqlMode SQL], LaTeX, [NxhtmlMode HTML], [CascadingStyleSheetMode CSS] and more. The snippet syntax is inspired from [http://manual.macromates.com/en/snippets TextMate's] syntax, you can even
[https://github.com/jwiegley/yasnippet/blob/master/extras/textmate_import.rb import] most !TextMate templates to YASnippet.

== Installation instructions ==

=== Standard install ===

To install the normal archive, download and unpack the latest <code>yasnippet-*.tar.bz2</code>. to a suitable directory like <code>~/.emacs.d/packages/</code> and add the following in your <code>~/.emacs</code> InitFile:

{{{
    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/packages/yasnippet-x.y.z")
    (require 'yasnippet) ;; not yasnippet-bundle
    (yas-global-mode 1)
}}}

=== With yasnippet-bundle.el ===

To quickly tryout Yasnippet, download the a simpler "bundle" version.
If you plan to modify the existing templates or make your own, you should
download the "normal" package.

1. Download <code>yasnippet-bundle-*.el tar gz</code> and unpack it.

2. You'll get a file named <code>yasnippet-bundle.el</code>, put it in <code>~/.emacs.d/packages/</code> (create that directory if not exists).

3. Open the file in Emacs, and type <code>Alt+x eval-buffer</code>.

That's it. Now, open any file, you'll see a menu "YASnippet".  You can
pull the menu to insert a template. Or, you can type a pre-defined
abbrev and press TAB to expand it! To have Emacs load YASnippet automatically 
when it starts, put the following in your <code>~/.emacs</code> file:

{{{
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/packages")
(require 'yasnippet-bundle)
}}}

== User contributed templates ==

See [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs-en/AndyStewart_YasnippetTemplate few  templates] I wrote.

Here are some templates for the JSP Standard Tag Library: http://github.com/eentzel/yasnippet-jstl/

There are four packages to automatically create yasnippets:

* [https://github.com/mlf176f2/r-autoyas.el R-autoyas] -- Creates automatic snippets for R in ess-mode

* ElAutoyas -- Creates automatic snippets for emacs-lisp-mode.

* Lisp:auto-yasnippet.el -- Quickly creates disposable yasnippets.

* [https://github.com/ejmr/php-auto-yasnippets php-auto-yasnippets] -- Creates snippets for php-mode

== Select snippet using helm (anything.el) ==

  (defun shk-yas/helm-prompt (prompt choices &optional display-fn)
    "Use helm to select a snippet. Put this into `yas/prompt-functions.'"
    (interactive)
    (setq display-fn (or display-fn 'identity))
    (if (require 'helm-config)
        (let (tmpsource cands result rmap)
          (setq cands (mapcar (lambda (x) (funcall display-fn x)) choices))
          (setq rmap (mapcar (lambda (x) (cons (funcall display-fn x) x)) choices))
          (setq tmpsource
                (list
                 (cons 'name prompt)
                 (cons 'candidates cands)
                 '(action . (("Expand" . (lambda (selection) selection))))
                 ))
          (setq result (helm-other-buffer '(tmpsource) "*helm-select-yasnippet"))
          (if (null result)
              (signal 'quit "user quit!")
            (cdr (assoc result rmap))))
      nil))

== Popup menu for yas-choose-value ==

Taken from http://blog.iany.me/2012/03/use-popup-isearch-for-yasnippet-prompt/

Note: yasnippet from git (ver. 0.8) (new yas-* instead of yas/* functions and variable names)

{{{
;;; use popup menu for yas-choose-value
(require 'popup)

;; add some shotcuts in popup menu mode
(define-key popup-menu-keymap (kbd "M-n") 'popup-next)
(define-key popup-menu-keymap (kbd "TAB") 'popup-next)
(define-key popup-menu-keymap (kbd "<tab>") 'popup-next)
(define-key popup-menu-keymap (kbd "<backtab>") 'popup-previous)
(define-key popup-menu-keymap (kbd "M-p") 'popup-previous)

(defun yas-popup-isearch-prompt (prompt choices &optional display-fn)
  (when (featurep 'popup)
    (popup-menu*
     (mapcar
      (lambda (choice)
        (popup-make-item
         (or (and display-fn (funcall display-fn choice))
             choice)
         :value choice))
      choices)
     :prompt prompt
     ;; start isearch mode immediately
     :isearch t
     )))

(setq yas-prompt-functions '(yas-popup-isearch-prompt yas-ido-prompt yas-no-prompt))
}}}

== ido-complete yasnippet keys ==
Evaluate this snippet:
{{{
;; Completing point by some yasnippet key
(defun yas-ido-expand ()
  "Lets you select (and expand) a yasnippet key"
  (interactive)
    (let ((original-point (point)))
      (while (and
              (not (= (point) (point-min) ))
              (not
               (string-match "[[:space:]\n]" (char-to-string (char-before)))))
        (backward-word 1))
    (let* ((init-word (point))
           (word (buffer-substring init-word original-point))
           (list (yas-active-keys)))
      (goto-char original-point)
      (let ((key (remove-if-not
                  (lambda (s) (string-match (concat "^" word) s)) list)))
        (if (= (length key) 1)
            (setq key (pop key))
          (setq key (ido-completing-read "key: " list nil nil word)))
        (delete-char (- init-word original-point))
        (insert key)
        (yas-expand)))))
}}}
and map yas-ido-expand with a chord, e.g.:

    (define-key yas-minor-mode-map (kbd "<C-tab>")     'yas-ido-expand)

enjoy ;)

YASnippet has recently entered version 0.6.x. For this version many of the tweaks in Lisp:yasnippet-config.el are probably invalid or unnecessary. See the [http://yasnippet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/changelog.html changelog]
-- JoaoTavora

[new]
This version of Lisp:yasnippet-config.el works fine with 0.6.x. -- [[rubikitch]]

[new]
I created a new method of importing TexMate templates entirely in emacs lisp.  Perhaps later it might be integrated into yasnippet itself.  Here is the code Lisp: [[textmate-to-yas.el]]  -- MatthewFidler

[new]

I have changed the startup mechanism so it doesn't load every single snippet upon startup.  Only loaded on demand. [[yas-jit.el]] (This file is for the 0.6.0 loading of yansippets OR for reference. After informing the yasnippet developer of the slow load times, he decided to implement his own JIT loading mechanism. For 0.7.0 series, this is now unnecessary.)
