==Intro==
YASnippet is a template system for emacs. It allows you to type a abbrevation and automatically expand the abbreviation into function templates.

Bundled language templates includes: C, C++, C#, Perl, Python, Ruby, SQL, LaTeX, HTML, CSS and more.

Yasnippet system is inspired by [http://macromates.com/ TextMate]'s template system. You can use a [https://groups.google.com/group/smart-snippet/browse_thread/thread/691fbdd33412d86e?pli=1 tool] to import any [http://macromates.com/ TextMate] template you have to YASnippet.

==Brief Install Instruction==

There are two archives of YASnippet. One is a single file compiled “bundle”, and the other is normal. If all you need is to use the builtin templates,
download the bundle one. If you want to add your own templates, download the normal one.

===Bundle Install===

# Download [http://code.google.com/p/yasnippet/downloads/list yasnippet-bundle] on the right sidebar and unpack it.
# You'll get a file named yasnippet-bundle.el, put it in ~/.emacs.d/plugins/ (create that directory if not exists).
# Open the file in Emacs, and type Alt+x eval-buffer.

That's it.

Now, open any one of your language file, you'll see a menu YASnippet. You can pull the menu to insert a template. Or, you can type the pre-defined abbrev
and press TAB to expand it.

To have emacs load YASnippet everytime it starts, put the following in your .emacs:

{{{
   (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/plugins")
   (require 'yasnippet-bundle)
}}}

===Normal Install===

For full install of the normal archive, just download and unpack the latest [http://code.google.com/p/yasnippet/downloads/list yasnippet-x.y.z.tar.bz2]. You'll get a directory named `yasnippet, put it in
~/.emacs.d/plugins/ and add the following in your .emacs:

{{{
    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/plugins")
    (require 'yasnippet) ;; not yasnippet-bundle
    (yas/initialize)
    (yas/load-directory "~/.emacs.d/plugins/yasnippet/snippets")
}}}

For full customization, please refer to the document.

===Simplified Installation and Workarounds===
For full install of the normal archive, just download and unpack the latest [http://code.google.com/p/yasnippet/downloads/list yasnippet-x.y.z.tar.bz2]. You'll get a directory named `yasnippet, put it in
~/.emacs.d/plugins/ and add the following in your .emacs:

Lisp:yasnippet-config.el simplifies installation and it has some workarounds.

{{{
    (require 'yasnippet-config)
    (yas/setup "~/.emacs.d/plugins/yasnippet")
}}}
