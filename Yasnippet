== Description ==

*YASnippet* is a template system for Emacs. It allows you to type an
abbreviation and automatically expand it into function
templates. 

See what it looks like: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18xYbPCJOho

Bundled language templates includes: C, C++, [CSharpMode C#], [PerlMode Perl], [PythonMode Python], [RubyMode Ruby],
[SqlMode SQL], LaTeX, [NxhtmlMode HTML], [CascadingStyleSheetMode CSS] and more. The snippet syntax is inspired from [http://manual.macromates.com/en/snippets TextMate's] syntax, you can even
[http://yasnippet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/snippet-development.html#importing-textmate-snippets import] most !TextMate templates to YASnippet.

== Installation instructions ==

=== Standard install ===

To install the normal archive, download and unpack the latest <code>yasnippet-*.tar.bz2</code>. to a suitable directory like <code>~/.emacs.d/packages/</code> and add the following in your <code>~/.emacs</code> InitFile:

{{{
    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/packages/yasnippet-x.y.z")
    (require 'yasnippet) ;; not yasnippet-bundle

    (yas/initialize)
    (yas/load-directory "~/.emacs.d/packages/yasnippet-x.y.z/snippets")
}}}

=== With yasnippet-bundle.el ===

To quickly tryout Yasnippet, download the a simpler "bundle" version.
If you plan to modify the existing templates or make your own, you should
download the "normal" package.

1. Download <code>yasnippet-bundle-*.el tar gz</code> and unpack it.

2. You'll get a file named <code>yasnippet-bundle.el</code>, put it in <code>~/.emacs.d/packages/</code> (create that directory if not exists).

3. Open the file in Emacs, and type <code>Alt+x eval-buffer</code>.

That's it. Now, open any file, you'll see a menu "YASnippet".  You can
pull the menu to insert a template. Or, you can type a pre-defined
abbrev and press TAB to expand it! To have Emacs load YASnippet automatically 
when it starts, put the following in your <code>~/.emacs</code> file:

{{{
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/packages")
(require 'yasnippet-bundle)
}}}

There are two packages to automatically create yasnippets:

* [https://github.com/mlf176f2/r-autoyas.el R-autoyas] -- Creates automatic snippets for R in ess-mode

* [https://github.com/mlf176f2/el-autoyas.el el-autoyas] -- Creates automatic snippets for emacs-lisp-mode.

YASnippet has recently entered version 0.6.x. For this version many of the tweaks in Lisp:yasnippet-config.el are probably invalid or unnecessary. See the [http://yasnippet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/changelog.html changelog]

This version of Lisp:yasnippet-config.el works fine with 0.6.x. -- [[rubikitch]]

I created a new method of importing TexMate templates entirely in emacs lisp.  Perhaps later it might be integrated into yasnippet itself.  Here is the code Lisp: [[textmate-to-yas.el]]  -- MatthewFidler

[new]

I have changed the startup mechanism so it doesn't load every single snippet upon startup.  Only loaded on demand.  [[yas-jit.el]]
