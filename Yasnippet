== Description ==

*YASnippet* is a template system for Emacs. It allows you to type an
abbreviation and automatically expand it into function
templates. Bundled language templates includes: C, C++, [CSharpMode C#], [PerlMode Perl], [PythonMode Python], [RubyMode Ruby],
[SqlMode SQL], LaTeX, [NxhtmlMode HTML], [CascadingStyleSheetMode CSS] and more. The snippet syntax is inspired from [http://manual.macromates.com/en/snippets TextMate's] syntax, you can even
[http://yasnippet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/snippet-development.html#importing-textmate-snippets import] most !TextMate templates to YASnippet.

== Install ==

=== Standard install ===

To install the normal archive, download and unpack the latest yasnippet-*.tar.bz2. to a suitable directory like ~/.emacs.d/packages/ and add the following in your ~/.emacs InitFile:

{{{
    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/packages/yasnippet-x.y.z")
    (require 'yasnippet) ;; not yasnippet-bundle

    (yas/initialize)
    (yas/load-directory "~/.emacs.d/packages/yasnippet-x.y.z/snippets")
}}}

=== With yasnippet-bundle.el ===

To quickly tryout Yasnippet, download the a simpler "bundle" version.
If you plan to work more with the bundled templates your own templates,
download the "normal" package.

1. Download yasnippet-bundle.el tar gz and unpack it.

2. You'll get a file named `yasnippet-bundle.el`, put it in `~/.emacs.d/packages/` (create that directory if not exists).

3. Open the file in Emacs, and type `Alt+x eval-buffer`.

That's it. Now, open any file, you'll see a menu "YASnippet".  You can
pull the menu to insert a template. Or, you can type a pre-defined
abbrev and press TAB to expand it!

To have Emacs load YASnippet automatically when it starts, put the following in your ~/.emacs file:

{{{
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/packages")
(require 'yasnippet-bundle)
}}}

== Configuration ==

See [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs-en/AndyStewart_YasnippetTemplate few  templates] I wrote.

== Discussion ==

[new]
YASnippet has recently entered version 0.6.x. For this version many of the tweaks in Lisp:yasnippet-config.el are probably invalid or unnecessary. See the [http://yasnippet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/changelog.html changelog]

== Old information ==

See Lisp:yasnippet-config.el for installation ideas and workarounds. -- [[rubikitch]]
