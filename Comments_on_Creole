As an intermediate step, we could replace our current main markup extension [[Oddmuse:Usemod Markup Extension]]) with a Creole implementation ([[Oddmuse:Creole Markup Extension]]). This would allow us to convert existing pages. If you are one of the EmacsWikiAdministrators, there is a way to run search & replace operations on the entire wiki using Perl regular expressions. If you wanted to get involved, I could set up a /copy/ of the site to experiment on.

As far as I remember, the only thing that's tricky is that the table syntax is different:

{{{
|| foo || bar ||
}}}

vs.

{{{
| foo | bar |
}}}

The problem is, of course, to figure out which occurrences of ##||## are actually part of table markup and which are not.

Also note that it is possible to [WikiDownloads download] all the pages, process them offline, and upload them again using scripts
([[Oddmuse:Automatic Posting and Uploading]]).
