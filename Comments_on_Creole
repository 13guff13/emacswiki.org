As an intermediate step, we could replace our current main markup extension [[Oddmuse:Usemod Markup Extension]]) with a Creole implementation ([[Oddmuse:Creole Markup Extension]]). This would allow us to convert existing pages. If you are one of the EmacsWikiAdministrators, there is a way to run search & replace operations on the entire wiki using Perl regular expressions. If you wanted to get involved, I could set up a /copy/ of the site to experiment on.
