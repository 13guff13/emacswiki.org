== Setting Meta With the XKB Extension ==

To use the XKB extension to fiddle with keys you can probably use some
tool that I don't have nor remember the name of, but if you don't have
it, here's a description of using xkbcomp.

First, get a source file of the keyboard map with

    xkbcomp $DISPLAY

which creates a file that probably starts with server_ and ends with
.xkb, the actual file name depends on the $DISPLAY variable.

Then edit that file -- with emacs of course -- and change whatever
you like ;-)

I do not have win keys, but something that looks like <> which
actually send the same codes as the win keys, aparently.  So assuming
you have ether keys, you would look for lines containig something
like:

    <LWIN> = 115;
    <RWIN> = 116;

Now, in case you have neither win, nor <> (diamond) keys (which
someone told me were real meta keys), you can use xev to find out the
actual codes your keys send and use those numbers, you don't have to
change the names of LWIN nor RWIN, just don't create name clashes.

Now look for line that defines what these keys do.  They look
something like:

    key <LWIN> {         [         Meta_L ] };
    key <RWIN> {         [         Meta_R ] };

and make them look like above.

After saving the file, compile it with the following command:

    xkbcomp server_<whatever-here>.xkb

This creates a file called server_<the-same-old-here>.xkm which you
can apply to the server with:

    xkbcomp server_<the-same-old-here>.xkm $DISPLAY

Now restart emacs.

Wow, now you have (probably) all of control, alt, shift and meta, and
are therefore free to use A- prefix for you own keys!

Enjoy ;-)
