: <em>2003-11-14 (1.0): This customized version of [ftp://ftp.newartisans.com:/pub/emacs/httpd.el httpd.el] is always current, plus whatever other modifications emacs-wiki.el or httpd-serve need.</em>


httpd.el is an HTTP server embedded in the Emacs. It supports GET and HEAD requests for static and dynamic content. (supporting POST should be easy by stealing code from CommonGatewayInterface above).

Note the following if you use Emacs version 21.4 or lower: Since Emacs doesn't support server sockets, you need to cheat a little and run it from a service such as tcpserver or inetd. You can get better performance by running a proxy server which forwards requests to a persistent emacs instance using gnuserv; see the commentary for details. Version 0.4, 2001-05-17 under GNU GPL.
