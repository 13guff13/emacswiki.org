spam.el is part of Oort Gnus, and documented in the manual.

GnusSpam can use many backends to achieve its job. For example you can tell GnusSpam
use SpamStat, or Bogofilter or ifile, etc... It is up to you to choose the way you want 
it to work.

You can configure GnusSpam either using 'customize' or the normal way.

To configure it using the customize interface, M-x customize-group RET spam RET.

I personnaly do not use customize at all so here is how I have set up my own GnusSpam.
It may be of interest to new GnusSpam user. Feel free to comment it (I
just have done it :)) and give other solutions to enhance a little bit
my current settings.

If you don't want to play with GroupParameters settings you have to disable the spam
entry from GroupParameters because it is defaulted to be used.

(Note, XEmacs users may encounter trouble, so it is recommended to them to use
customize instead).

Add these lines in your configuration file :

   (require 'spam)

   (setq spam-use-bogofilter t) ; I am using bogofilter but there are others

   (setq gnus-install-group-spam-parameters nil)


   ;; Here I define general anti-spam things
   ;; it only say that on exiting all groups matching nnml:private.*,
   ;; we launch the spam processor and ham processor (using bogofilter)
   (setq gnus-spam-process-newsgroups
       '(("nnml:.*" (gnus-group-spam-exit-processor-bogofilter
			       gnus-group-ham-exit-processor-bogofilter)))

   ;; All messages marked as spam in these groups should go to spambox

        gnus-spam-process-destinations '(("nnml:.*" "nnml:spambox"))

   ;; and ham found into the spambox should be moved to reclassify group

        gnus-ham-process-destinations '(("nnml:spambox" "nnml:reclassify"))
        spam-junk-mailgroups '("nnml:spambox")
        spam-split-group "nnml:spambox")

Then you can say to your favorite split function to use the spam-split as well.
This is done that way : 
 

   (setq   nnmail-split-fancy
          '(|
		      (: spam-split)
	 ... other rules
   )

There are a few key bindings you can use when in the SummaryBuffer but
the most important is (IMHO) 'Sx' or 'M\-d' to mark a message as spam in the SummaryBuffer.

You can also use 'St' to score spam.

Note that all unread messages from a spam group is automatically marked as spam when
you exit the group.

Spam's mark in the SummaryBuffer is '$' for $pam but it should be configurable (?).

Also note that you have to train intensively Bogofilter to have it
more reliable.
