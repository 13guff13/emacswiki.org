== How to Install ==

Build from source:

# get Emacs sources (version 23 or later)
# ./configure --with-ns
# make
# make install
# copy nextstep/Emacs.app to target location

Emacs.app is the result of building Emacs with support for the !NeXTstep / !OpenStep / Cocoa API family. [http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2005-09/msg00634.html]
It will run on Mac OS 10.3 and later as well as [http://gnustep.org/ GNUstep], the free implementation of !OpenStep for GNU/Linux, Windows, Darwin, the free BSDs, and other unix platforms.

Install via macports:

{{{
sudo port install emacs-app-devel
}}}

[[http://drop.io/emacsapp|Emacs.app 23 binary package]] (built from 2009-01-04 CVS version using macports) for Mac OS X Tiger (10.4) or higher users (PowerPC only).

== Enhancement ==

A set of enhancements making Emacs.app more Mac-like without going as far as AquamacsEmacs or similar distributions is available as an elisp package: NSPlatformSupport.


== Path ==

Emacs.app on Mac OS X does not inherit the same value of PATH environment variable as on another OS, or as in the shell running in either Terminal or Emacs. Apple describes this behaviour a bit here: http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2001/qa1067.html. The file ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist can also be used as central place to save key:value pairs for all shells. The defaults programme allows to read and write, for example:

	export PATH=$(defaults read "${HOME}/.MacOSX/environment" PATH)         # bash
	set path=(`defaults read ~/.MacOSX/environment PATH | tr ':' ' '`)           # tcsh

NOTE: Remember when you make a change to environment.plist, you need to restart your computer before it takes effect.

For those that like their PATHs from .bashrc and would like the environment.plist to update itself at every start up, put the following in your /etc/profile file:

    #/etc/profile begin
    if [ -x /usr/libexec/path_helper ]; then
        eval `/usr/libexec/path_helper -s`
        defaults write $HOME/.MacOSX/environment PATH "$PATH"
    fi
    #/etc/profile end

== Launching from Spotlight ==

Because Spotlight's parent process is launchd, Emacs won't pick up any environment variables you have set in your ##.bashrc## or similar. To set environment variables for launchd, put them in in ##/etc/launchd.conf## or ##$HOME/.launchd.conf##. The syntax is tcsh.
For example:

    % cat /etc/launchd.conf 
    # include macports in global path - basically so Emacs.app can see git
    setenv PATH /opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin

You will have to reboot for launchd to reload ##launchd.conf##. If you don't want to do that, you can use ##launchctl setenv## to set environment variables for launchd like so:

    % launchctl setenv PATH /opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin

== Keyboard Handling and European Characters ==

Some useful resources: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.petermaurer.de/nasi.php?section=keycodes

I have tried outlining 3 basic options for European users in a blog post/video [[http://blog.enqueue.eu/emacs_mac_2 here]]. I do not have a clue about Asian character input, though. Open to comment.


== Questions ==

* I'm missing an "emacs" binary, to execute from the command line, from Emacs.app. It's expected by some Makefiles, for instance. Does anyone know how to create or fake one? -- ThomasKappler

[new]
The executable binary is already there: Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs. -- UntitledApple

[new]
* Is there a way to get visual beep to NOT be a 100x100 black square
in the middle of the window? That's beyond unusable and completely
preventing me from upgrading from 22 to 23. -- RyanDavis

* These build directions fail under 10.6.1 (Snow Leopard).  Does anyone know when a fix is planned?

** Snow Leopard (10.6.1) has to be 32bit. 

        $ CC='gcc -arch i386' ./configure --with-ns
        $ make bootstrap

** The above still blows up for me on 10.6.1, trying to compile 23.1, as does trying to just run 'make' after the configure step.
