Emacs Lisp is the language that much of Emacs is written in, and it is also the language that you can use to customize Emacs for your own use.

Don't worry - even if you're an EmacsNewbie, you can get the hang of it. Learning a little Emacs Lisp will help you use Emacs more effectively.

== Learn about the Emacs Lisp for things you already use ==

* Use `C-x ESC ESC' to repeat [[command]]s you execute, and look at the Emacs Lisp code that executes them, before hitting `RET' (Return) -- see RepeatLastCommand.
* Use `C-h f' (`describe-function') and `C-h v' (`describe-variable') to understand commands and [[variable]]s you use. You'll see a description of the function or variable. If you have the Emacs sources installed, you'll see a link to the source code as well. Click on the link or go to it and press RET to read the source code. When you want to know what a function does, use `C-h f' on it, and so on.
* Use `C-h k' to see which commands you are executing when you use [[key]]s. Then follow the previous bullet: click the name (link) of the command to see its source code...

== Resources ==

* Read the ''Emacs Lisp Introduction'': EmacsLispIntro. Use `C-h i', then choose `Emacs Lisp Intro'.  You can also read this manual [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eintr/index.html on the Web]].
* Read the ''Emacs Lisp Reference'' manual: EmacsLispReference. Use `C-h i', then choose `Elisp' (Emacs Lisp is sometimes called "Elisp"). You can also read this manual [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/index.html on the Web]].
