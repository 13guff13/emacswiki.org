What are some new and cool features available in the spooky CVS tree?

* [[Js2Mode]]
* GVFS support in TrampMode
* [[GDB-MI]]

The easiest way to find new stuff is to read [http://savannah.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/*checkout*/emacs/emacs/etc/NEWS?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/plain the Emacs NEWS file in CVS]

The major forks are typically visible by visiting the CVS log file for CVS:version.el
