==Description==

!TypoScript mode is an Emacs mode for developing !TypoScript scripts for the Content Management System [http://typo3.org/ Typo3].

==Introduction==

<i>Necessity is the mother of invention.</i> This is why I started to program a mode for Typo3's scripting language !TypoScript. I designed it for my personal needs. Nevertheless, I hope the mode will support your editing of !TypoScript files, too. Feel free to modify the code that it will meet your requirements.

Thanks to AlexSchroeder for providing this easy to use platform for Emacs and its friends.

Special thanks to the authors of those various Emacs modes who share their knowlegde with other people by putting their code under GPL. I might not have programmed any line of Elisp without these guidelines.

==Features==
* Syntax highlighting.
* Indentation.
* Block folding.

==Installation==
To install just drop this file into a directory on your load-path and byte-compile it.  To set up Emacs to automatically edit files ending in ".ts" using ts-mode add the following to your ~/.emacs file (GNU Emacs) or ~/.xemacs/init.el file (XEmacs):

    (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.ts$" . ts-mode) auto-mode-alist))
    (autoload 'ts-mode "ts-mode" "TypoScript file editing mode." t)

==Usage==

===Key bindings===
; <tt>C-c C-e</tt>:
Calls <code>ts-fold-block</code> function. It folds the block at point which is wrapped by braces `{' and `}'.
; <tt>C-c C-a</tt>:
Calls <code>ts-unfold-block</code> function. It unfolds the folded block at point.
; <tt>C-c C-u C-r</tt>:
Calls <code>ts-unfold-region</code> function. It unfolds the folded blocks in marked region.
; <tt>C-c C-u C-b</tt>:
Calls <code>ts-unfold-buffer</code> function. It unfolds all folded blocks in the current buffer.

===Customization===
The customization group is <tt>typoscript<tt>. You can edit the following variables:

; <tt>ts-newline-function</tt>:
Defines the function to be called after pressing `RET'. You can choose from
* <code>newline</code>
* <code>newline-and-indent</code>
* <code>reindent-then-newline-and-indent</code>

The default value is <code>newline-and-indent</code>.

; <tt>ts-block-indentation</tt>:
Sets the indentation width relative to a predecessing line which begins a new block. In !TypoScript blocks start with the left parenthesis `(' or the left brace `{'. The default value is <code>2</code>.
; <tt>ts-fold-foreground-color</tt>:
Sets the foreground color used to highlight the folded block. The default value is `white'.  For a list of all available colors use <code>M-x list-colors-display</code>
; <tt>ts-fold-background-color</tt>:
Sets the background color used to highlight the folded block. The default value is `DodgerBlue1'.  For a list of all available colors use <code>M-x list-colors-display</code>.

===Hook===
<code>ts-mode-hook</code>
