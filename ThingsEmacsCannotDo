Collecting features which other editors have and Emacs doesn't can be good inspiration for new Emacs features. How about assembling a list of stuff here which Emacs can't do?

I'll start the list:

* [http://www.sublimetext.com/ Minimap] of Sublime editor. See the left side of the screenshots.
** This is now possible using ##minimap.el##. Please see the page [[Mini Map]] for Details.

* [http://player.vimeo.com/video/41090089 typing on several lines at once], also of Sublime editor
