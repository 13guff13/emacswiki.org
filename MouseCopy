mouse-copy.el comes with Emacs 21.

Normally, copy and paste require two steps: mark the region to be copied, then paste with the middle mouse button. Using mouse-copy.el, you only have to mark the region, the pasting is done automatically.

There is an alternative mouse-copy minor mode that more closely mimics the Zmacs/ZWEI Lisp Machine mouse copy functionality and handles spaces better at [https://github.com/vsedach/mouse-copy].
