I'm Dirk-Jan C. Binnema (djcb). 

I've been using GNU/Emacs since '96 or so; still, emacs holds many secrets for me, and a bit of clicking around in EmacsWiki often teaches me some new trick. I am collecting these tricks in a blog: [http://emacs-fu.blogspot.com EmacsFu].

Anyhow, the condensation of all these tricks: my .emacs: [http://www.djcbsoftware.nl/dot-emacs.html]. I'm trying to keep in well-documented, so it can be used for cherry-picking.

I've written TexDrive, an emacs minor mode for including TeX-formula in webpages
