Emacs Web Wowser (eww) is a Web browser written in elisp and based on shr.el.  It is part of the latest Emacs (24.4) release.  It supports some basic CSS and HTML5.

== Windows ==

To access web pages via HTTPS, you need to install GnuTLS, provided for example as part of [http://sourceforge.net/projects/ezwinports/files/ ezwinports]. Make sure that the location of <code>gnutls-cli.exe</code> and of the GnuTLS DLLs is in <code>%PATH%</code>. You may also need to install certificates, as explained in Magnus’ article [http://xn--9dbdkw.se/diary/how_to_enable_GnuTLS_for_Emacs_24_on_Windows/index.en.html “how to enable GnuTLS for Emacs 24 on Windows”].
