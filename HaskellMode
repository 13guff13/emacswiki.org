haskell-mode 2.3 does not correctly indent else/then clauses. To let else/then be cycled,
find ((looking-at "\\(?:in\\|of\\then\\|else\\)\\>")  which should be on or about line 1189
and change it to ((looking-at "\\(?:in\\|of\\)\\>"). This isn't a true fix but it does keep else/then
keyword from being flushed with the `if'.

Some customisations to make the haskell editing experience a bit smoother:

 (add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook
           #'(lambda ()
               (setq comment-padding " ")
               (setq comment-start "--")))

 (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.hs\\'" . haskell-mode))



If you use FillAdapt:

 (add-to-list 'filladapt-token-table '("-- " haskell-comment))
 (add-to-list 'filladapt-token-match-table '(haskell-comment haskell-comment))
 (add-to-list 'filladapt-token-conversion-table '(haskell-comment . exact))

The Haskell wiki has an interesting note on using mmm-mode (from MultipleModes) so that you can write your scholarly paper while still hacking.
