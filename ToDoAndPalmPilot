I did some work trying to write a conduit between OliverSeidel's
TodoMode and the PalmPilot.  The problem is that exchanging data is
lossy in both directions.  Not all of the fields in todo-mode
translate well to the fields on the palm, and not all of the fields on
the palm translate well to fields in todo-mode.  I kindof got it
working.  You can find it at
http://www.lathi.net/pages/syncemacstodo.html for what that's worth.
I highly doubt you'll be able to get it working out of the box.  I had
to hack up todo-mode.el slightly to get it working and specially
format my todo list in emacs.  Anyway, I really gave up on it because
it just didn't work right; the old square peg in a round hole.

So, this morning I was thinking about it again for the first time in
months.  What I decided was that a new todo-mode needs to be written
explicitly for working with the palm.  Call it palm-todo-mode.  This
mode would have a 1:1 relationship of the fields from the Palm's ToDo
database.  The other thing I thought about making this todo-mode
different from OliverSeidel's is that I would store the todo items
as a lisp list in the todo file (like .newsrc.el vs. .newsrc for
Gnus).  Have the actual todo list stored in .todo.el.  When the user
specifically saves the todo list, export it to a .todo that would be
in a format to import into the Diary.  You could even have a variable
like palm-todo-diary-format which would have field key codes for the
order to print the todo item fields (i.e. "*/* %p %D %d" where %p is
priority, %D is due date, and %d is description).

Anyway, I put it on my todo list to write the palm-todo-mode and then
write the conduit to sync with.  We'll see when I get to it.  I only
wanted to write it up here not as vaporware (Wiki:VapourWare),
but to document my ideas
in case someone else wanted to do it.
