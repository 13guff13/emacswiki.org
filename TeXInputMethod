One of many available InputMethods for entering Unicode text, the TeX input method allows you to enter Unicode characters by typing in sequences reminiscent of those used for input by the typesetting language TeX. For example, typing ##\lambda## inserts a Î».

As would be expected, this input method may be invoked with `M-x set-input-method' and entering `TeX'.

A list of available sequences may be viewed with `M-x describe-input-method'
