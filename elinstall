** What it is

An installer for elisp code. It sets up autoloads, load-path, etc.

** Why use it

There are other package installers and there is "autoload.el", bundled
with emacs.  Why use elinstall?  Because:

* It works with my-site-start (DotEmacsModular) (which I highly recommend)

* It supports slash-style paths, like 
  : (require 'emtest/testhelp/tagnames)

* Unlike autoload.el, it can also set up load-path and
  Info-default-directory-list (that's like load-path for info files)

* Unlike autoload.el, it's not focussed on building emacs, it's
  focussed on installing elisp.

* Unlike some other installers, it works with canonical
  loaddefs.el-style autoload files.

* Unlike other installers, what you install doesn't have to be
  pre-packaged, and there are no restrictions on what means you can
  use to get the elisp files - elinstall doesn't care, it obeys the
  motto "do one thing well".
  But it also works well for packages.

* Because internally it works in articulated stages, it's easier to
  hack and extend than autoload.el

** Where to get it

It lives at http://repo.or.cz/w/elinstall.git and it will also be available thru ELPA.
