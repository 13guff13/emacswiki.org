EmacsPortable is currently located at: 

http://esnm.sourceforge.net/EmacsPortable.html

The forthcoming release includes the following packages:

* Icicles -- Dynamic Completion.  '''Note 1:''' Icicles does not include bookmark+.  bookmark+ increases loadup time dramatically.
* Auto-complete 
* color-theme
* tiny-tools
* McompleteMode
* Iswitchb+
* AUCTeX
* Emacs Speaks Statistics
* Emacs Speaks NONMEM (part of the reson I started this distribution)
* Anything
* Vimpulse with viper-in-more-modes
* Tabbar
* Yasnippet
* todochiku
* nxhtml
* cursor-chg
* Unified folding interface (fold-dwim)
** Optional org-mode-like tab-based showing and hiding of code

It has the following features:

* Tabbar mode similar in appearance to AquaEmacs
* Popup menu and toolbar (optional)
* When trying to use Tabbar and ruler-mode together, mouse movement shows the tabbar and typing shows the ruler.

Since this is primarily for Portable Drives, the following space saving devices and functions are available when installing on portable drives:

* The possibility of only including elc files
* Compressing most GnuWin32 utilites with upx (except for dlls)
* Compressing el and elc files with gzip.  This may cause some problems with certain packages like ErgoEmacs.  The compression can be turned on or off with the compress and decompress emacs programs.
* Stealth installation -- improve speed of Emacs by putting in the windows temporary directory (after it has been installed in a portable drive)
* Local installation -- install the portable emacs locally (after it has been installed in a portable drive)
