python-mode.el is part of the Python distribution. You can also download it from launchpad:

    * https://launchpad.net/python-mode

The relevant page also has installation instructions. The following was enough for me, though:

    * Add python-mode.el to the LoadPath.
    * Add the following to your InitFile

 (autoload 'python-mode "python-mode" "Python Mode." t)
 (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.py\\'" . python-mode))
 (add-to-list 'interpreter-mode-alist '("python" . python-mode))

: It should be noted that python-mode.el, since it is part of python, doesn't usually need to be seperately installed. Also, many distros will also add relevant autoload code; Gentoo adds it too site-lisp/site-gentoo.el or possibly site-lisp/site-gentoo.d  -- CH

For Emacs 22 and after, consider ProgrammingWithPythonDotEl

== some more commands ===

 (defun py-next-block ()
   "go to the next block.  Cf. `forward-sexp' for lisp-mode"
   (interactive)
   (py-mark-block nil 't)
   (back-to-indentation))

ElDoc works with the python mode in GNU Emacs 22.
(For Emacs 21, see the [http://www.loveshack.ukfsn.org/emacs/eldoc.el back-port] of Eldoc.)
To enable it by default in your python mode buffers, you might want something like:

   (add-hook 'python-mode-hook
          '(lambda () (eldoc-mode 1)) t)

'py-help-at-point' can be used to get the internal python documentation on the function at point.

For Emacs 23: 
C-c C-f	"sys" -- this works, and describes the "sys" module in a separate Emacs help buffer.
: If I define function "zoot", help doesn't on it -- it's only for global things.
