There is not yet an implementation of Emacs in CommonLisp.
A lot of people would like to see one, however.
It is often talked about on news:comp.lang.lisp. The McCLIM source includes the beginning of an Emacs in CL, but it's not yet usable (cf. http://www.mikemac.com/mikemac/McCLIM/).

There's also a page over on the Common Lisp Wiki on the subject.
CLiki:CL-Emacs

Hmm, what about HemLock, the editor distributed with CMUCL? It is
written in CommonLisp, and in the tradition of the [[WikiPedia:Lisp machine]] editor
[[ZWEI]] and the ITS implementation, TecoEmacs. Includes a news and email
client, can display to tty or X11. See
http://www.cons.org/cmucl/hemlock/. -- EricMarsden

Gilbert Baumann "ported" Hemlock to standard Common Lisp.  The
resulting project is called Phemlock, for Portable Hemlock.
See the project page (http://common-lisp.net/project/phemlock) for
details. -- EmilioLopes

ErikNaggum had a project running once.

There is a mailing list for people interested in this:

* http://lists.unlambda.com/mailman/listinfo/cl-emacs

It was created 2001-09-29 due to a lengthy discussion on
news:comp.lang.lisp in a thread entitled "Re: ZWEI (Re: emacs rules
and vi sucks)".

There is also FRED (Fred Resembles Emacs Deliberately), which is an emacs implemented in CommonLisp.  It comes with Macintosh Common Lisp, which means it is limited to running on Mac OS 9 or X on PPC machines. It can be downloaded at ftp://clozure.com/pub/MCL/

Having used MCL and FRED I have to say FRED really stands for FRED Requires Extensive Debugging. The keybindings are also garbage and its attempt to be compatible with mac bindings just makes things worse. --sabetts
