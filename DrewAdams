== Where's the Glue? ==

|| || || ||  || '''EMACS exists because I felt free to make individually useful small improvements on a path whose end was not in sight.''' -- RMS, ''EMACS: The Extensible, Customizable Display Editor'', <tt>http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-paper.html </tt> || ||  ||  || ||
[new]

That's not a bad summary of what free/open software development is all about, IMO:
* freedom to modify (source)
* individually useful changes
* small changes
* on a path, but one without a clear destination

The fact that useful software changes can be ''individually'' useful and small, without being part of an overall predefined design, is maybe not an explicit tenet of the philosophy of free software development, but it is in fact a precondition and a consequence of such development. The idea that individually useful changes are ''likely'' to lead to something that is useful in the aggregate is important -- and ''not obvious'', in terms of modularity and group design & development.

This free/open software development model (combine individually useful changes, without necessarily adhering to a predefined design) reminds me of the Unix philosophy (vs what came before it) of producing small, modular programs that can easily be combined to produce more powerful functionality (vs monolithic, swiss-army-knife, do-all systems/functions). Here's the question:

: What makes Unix (or GNU/Linux) so ''modular'' -- so propitious to the ''combination'' of small programs?
* character streams as both input and output (what one program outputs, another can input)
* pipes (glue programs together: outputs to inputs)

The same question, applied to functional programming:

: What makes (pure, lazy, higher-order) functional programming so ''modular'' --  so propitious to the ''combination'' of small programs? 
* higher-order functions (glue simple functions together to make complex functions)
* lazy evaluation (glue whole programs together: outputs to inputs)

IOW, it's about '''modularity''', and modularity is all about '''glue''': the ''ability to combine'' pieces.

For a fabulous essay on the modularity and "glue" of functional programming, see John Hughes's classic, ''Why Functional Programming Matters'': <tt>http://www.md.chalmers.se/~rjmh/Papers/whyfp.html. </tt> From the Introduction (emphasis added):

[new]
: The special characteristics and advantages of functional programming are
often summed up more or less as follows. Functional programs contain _no assignment statements_, so variables, once given a value, never change. More
generally, functional programs contain _no side-effects_ at all. A function call can
have no effect other than to compute its result. This eliminates a major source
of bugs, and also makes the order of execution irrelevant -- since no side-effect
can change the value of an expression, it can be evaluated at any time. This
relieves the programmer of the burden of prescribing the _flow of control_. Since
expressions can be evaluated at any time, one can freely replace variables by
their values and vice versa -- that is, programs are “referentially transparent”.
This freedom helps make functional programs more tractable mathematically
than their conventional counterparts.

: Such a catalogue of “advantages” is all very well, but one must not be surprised
if outsiders don’t take it too seriously. It says a lot about ''what functional programming is '''not''''' (it has _no assignment_, _no side effects_, _no flow of control_) but
not much about what it ''is''. The functional programmer sounds rather like a medieval
monk, denying himself the pleasures of life in the hope that it will make
him virtuous. To those more interested in material benefits, these “advantages”
are not very convincing.

: Functional programmers argue that there ''are'' great material benefits -- that
a functional programmer is an order of magnitude more productive than his
conventional counterpart, because functional programs are an order of magnitude
shorter. Yet why should this be? The only faintly plausible reason one
can suggest on the basis of these “advantages” is that conventional programs
consist of 90% assignment statements, and in functional programs these can be
omitted! This is plainly ridiculous. If omitting assignment statements brought
such enormous benefits then FORTRAN programmers would have been doing it
for twenty years. '''''It is a logical impossibility to make a language more powerful
by omitting features, no matter how bad they may be.'''''

: Even a functional programmer should be dissatisfied with these so-called
advantages, because they give him no help in exploiting the power of functional
languages. One cannot write a program which is particularly lacking in assignment
statements, or particularly referentially transparent. There is no ''yardstick
of program quality'' here, and therefore no ideal to aim at.

: Clearly this characterisation of functional programming is inadequate. We
must find something to put in its place -- something which not only explains the
power of functional programming, but also gives a clear indication of what the
functional programmer should strive towards.
[new]

An analogy is then drawn with the "no <code>GOTO</code>!" arguments in favor of structured programming -- and the conclusion is that it is its ''modularity'', not its lack of <code>GOTO</code>, that gives structured programming its advantage. The rest of the paper explores the modularity advantages provided by higher-order functions and lazy evaluation.

I heartily recommend this 20-year old paper. I guarantee that it is an eye-opener, no matter how familiar you are with functional programming and programming-language design.

Coming back to free/open software development -- By analogy, what is the "glue" that makes this kind of development work? What makes it possible to glue many small, individually useful software changes together and still get something worthwhile accomplished? How does this work, even in the absence (some might argue ''especially'' in the absence) of a predefined design? That's a question for reflection. Some may hark back to Adam Smith for an answer; others, to Mikhail Bakunin; still others, to Karl Marx. I'd say that the question is open, but these are at least part of the "glue" answer:

* open source code (your output is my input)
* Internet communication (pipes, if you will)

== I Use Emacs ==

... though sometimes I think ''Emacs uses me''.  In fact, Emacs and I have used each other since the mid 1980s. 

First, I used '''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gosling_Emacs Gosling Emacs]''' (we just called it Emacs), with Mock Lisp. Mock Lisp was fun -- er, a mess. No real lists at all. No real arguments to functions -- just error-prone global-variable pseudo-arguments. In fact, about the only thing it had in common with Lisp was the parentheses. Fun, though.

But Gosling Emacs was Emacs, in any case: an extendable text editor that you could do what you want with. It impressed me quite a lot, after years (don't ask!) programming with other editors of various sorts (I said, don't ask!). I was impressed with its programmability -- on the fly, no less (interpreted language). I was particularly impressed with '''''[[EmacsTags|TAGS]]''''' -- hit a key on a name in a program somewhere and ''shazzam!''...takes you to the defining source code. Magic. Cool. Handy. The other remarkable thing I noticed about Emacs was that it was self documenting. Long before objects began orienting themselves with an eye to fashion, Emacs objects spoke to you about themselves. And, though Emacs's hyperlinked '''''[[Info]]''''' manuals might seem, well, ordinary now, next to the Web, at that time there was no Web, and online hyperlinked documentation didn't even exist -- except for Emacs Info. Cool it was.

Anyway... From Gosling Emacs we moved to '''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Emacs GNU Emacs]''', with EmacsLisp, when it came along. We also used '''Zmacs''', on Symbolics Lisp machines. I programmed mostly in Lisp then anyway (Franz and Common), so these Emacs versions were great to have. 

Over the years, I've customized the hell out of Emacs. At first it was just new [[command]]s, functions, and [[key binding]]s, but when '''Epoch''' came out in the early 90's (with proportional fonts, colored [[face]]s, [[frame]]s, images, menus, and such) there was suddenly a ''lot'' more you could do to make Emacs (Epoch) fit your individual needs or dreams. The combination of these new, powerful features with the somewhat limited out-of-the-box user interface positively ignited user customization, and I was no exception.

The downside of doing a lot of customization is having to ''redo'' it when a new Emacs version comes out and lots of basic stuff has changed so that things are incompatible. I've been there & done that way too many times. The last couple of major releases, I've ended up abandoning useful stuff I wrote just because I didn't have the time to upgrade it. That's OK; some of it deserved to be left behind.

And Emacs has improved greatly over the years. I still use Emacs 20, for the most part, but I've finally converted most of my customizations to run on Emacs 20, 21, 22, and 23 (see the list at DrewsElispLibraries). Sometimes I work at converting some of the rest, when I get the chance.

Hey Drew, I just wanted to let you know that your emacs libraries are so much awesome.  I totally dig [[Icicles]], and can hardly wait to install DoReMi.  Even the ones I don't use (FisheyeWithThumbs isn't much use for a guy who prefers a single frame) are still awesome in their design.  Thank you!  -- JonathanArkell

[new:DrewAdams:2009-05-18 16:20 UTC]
Thank you Jonathan. Enjoy! Bug reports and suggestions welcome. Thx -- DrewAdams

[new:rubikitch:2010-05-03 07:51 UTC]
Hi Drew! There is `reporter-submit-bug-report', a autoload function to send a bug report with dumping variables. I wonder why you do not use it. -- [[rubikitch]]

[new:DrewAdams:2010-05-02 23:42 UTC]
Hi Rubikitch. I have used it. I don't recall why I don't use it more now. Why do you ask? -- DrewAdams

[new:rubikitch:2010-05-03 11:17 UTC]
I think `reporter-submit-bug-report' is useful especially variable dump. I want to know the drawback of it because you do not use it. I'll try to use it. Thanks. -- [[rubikitch]]

[new:DrewAdams:2010-05-03 04:21 UTC]
It doesn't mean anything special that I don't use it. ;-) I agree that it can be useful to dump a select set of relevant variables (as opposed to a humongous list, for instance) into a bug-report mail skeleton. I've just never bothered. The only info I gather automatically is ##(emacs-version)## -- e.g. command `bookmarkp-send-bug-report'.

Typically, I'm interested in other things the user can describe about the problem, and I'll just ask about any vars I think might be pertinent if they aren't spontaneously reported. But that's not a reason not to use `reporter'.  Regards -- DrewAdams
