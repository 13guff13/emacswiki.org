Full name Taylan Ulrich Bay覺rl覺/Kammer (Bay覺rl覺 in Turkish citizenship, Kammer in German).

Born December 1993, discovered Unix etc. at around 2010, has an obsession for stuff like elegance and correctness, thus soon became a fan of subjects like micro-kernels and [[Scheme]].

Started using Emacs in 2012.
