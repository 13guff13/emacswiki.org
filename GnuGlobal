==GNU GLOBAL==
The GNU GLOBAL package is highly recommended for using a single tags file, covering all files in all subdirectories, that lives at the base of a source-code tree.

* http://www.gnu.org/software/global/

The package comes with gtags.el that integrates it seamlessly into Emacs.

===Cycling through GNU Global result===
The gtags.el package doesn't cycle through gtags result.  Here's some code for doing it.

===Alternative interface to GNU GLOBAL===

If, for whatever reasons, you do not feel comfortable with the
interface gtags.el provides, you might try xgtags.el instead. Since
its look and feel is more like that of xcscope.el, it differs from
gtags.el in several ways:

* searching tags is completely stack based which manifests in the
  fact, that there is only one tag selection buffer; if you pop the
  stack, the previous search results are restored
* support for incremental database update and queries on more than one
  database
* query-replace based on the current search result
* the selection buffer is colored :-)
* the package can be downloaded from http://home.tiscali.de/mgidde/source/xgtags.el (link is dead; does anyone know another source than <http://www.mail-archive.com/help-global@gnu.org/msg00022/xgtags.el> or the newer one from <http://web.archive.org/web/20080117124425/http://home.tiscali.de/mgidde/source/xgtags.el>?)

[new]
while using xgtags.el, if you have spaces in the path for sources, you may want to consider to change xgtags--tag-regexp like

<code>
(defconst xgtags--file-regexp "\\([^ \t]+\\)[ \t]+\\([0-9]+\\)[ \t]+\\(.*\\.\\(cpp\\|hpp\\|h\\|c\\|idl\\)\\)[ \t]+\\(.+\\)$" "...")
</code>

Lisp:anything-gtags.el is [[Anything]] interface. See also AnythingApplications. -- [[rubikitch]]


CEDET (CollectionOfEmacsDevelopmentEnvironmentTools) supports the use of GNU Global as a back-end to some tasks.  They include:
* EDE Locate - Helps EDE find files in your project, like header files.
* SemanticBovinator Symref backend, for finding symbol usages.
* Semantic Database backend, for finding tags by name.
