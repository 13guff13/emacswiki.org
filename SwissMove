When moving through large files the usual scrolling functions might be too slow. Swiss movement is introduced to mean moving in smaller and smaller steps.

At the first keystroke (say it goes down) you'll move halfway to the end of the file (counting from your current position).  If you continue moving in that direction the behaviour will stay the same.

If, however, you change direction you will be carried halfway back towards your starting position.  

Imagine it like this (plain stupid ASCII-art)

 Start  press1 press2 press3

: ''I like these kinds of hacks that sort of breaks the normal "rules" we are used to. But I wonder, is it useful? Yes, I could test myself but I just wanted to know if it is just a cool thing that *maybe could* be useful or if people really use it. And I'm too lazy right now... :) -- MaDa''

:: I wrote it yesterday and start to really use it today.  It feels funny but I'll keep on trying ;-) -- StefanKamphausen
