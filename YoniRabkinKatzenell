== About ==

My name is Yoni Rabkin. I've been using GNU/Emacs ever since I've started using GNU/Linux years ago and have never looked back. I used Emacs to edit my first Linux file when I tried to connect my new GNU/Linux box to the Internet for the first time. I had first read about Emacs in Philip Greenspun's book "Philip and Alex's guide to Web publishing".

I have a few patches in GNU/Emacs.

I contribute to the [[EMMS]] project, I wrote parts of it and use it daily. I also (re)wrote most of the Emms manual and designed the logo.

I organize my life using text files in GNU/Emacs and a few simple rules. I'd write more about my technique if anyone asked.

You can occasionally find me on irc.freenode.net in #fsf or #fsf-members as [::yrk].

[http://yrk.nfshost.com My homepage] has a bit more info, or try [http://themarketscoreboard.com/ my personal hobby site].

== Emacs Hacking ==

=== wireless.el ===
I wrote, and use [http://gitorious.org/wireless wireless.el] for wireless status information. Essentially it pretty-prints /proc/net/wireless into your mode line, and is based on Ralph Schleicher's battery.el.

=== analog-clock.el ===
I wrote [http://yrk.nfshost.com/repos/analog-clock/analog-clock.el analog-clock.el]. It is an animated analog clock (Seven-Segment or turny) for your temporal enjoyment. It should be in GNU/Emacs proper.

=== vernacular-time.el ===
I wrote [http://yrk.nfshost.com/repos/vernacular-time/vernacular-time.el vernacular-time.el] to display times stamps in Emacs in the vernacular. It has a useful Dired mode to transform "ls" time stamps. You can pull from the Darcs repository at http://yrk.nfshost.com/repos/vernacular-time/. This too should come with GNU/Emacs.

=== slime-cl-pitfalls.el ===
SLIME, the Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs, displays a MOTD type encouragement when loaded. With [http://yrk.nfshost.com/repos/slime-cl-pitfalls/slime-cl-pitfalls.el slime-cl-pitfalls.el] you will instead be treated with a randomly selected Common Lisp pitfall for your edification. You can pull from the Darcs repository at http://yrk.nfshost.com/repos/slime-cl-pitfalls/.

=== rt-liberation.el ===
rt-liberation is a GNU/Emacs interface to the [http://bestpractical.com/rt/ RT] system. I wrote and use it every day in order to avoid using a browser and an HTML Web interface to RT. It integrages with Gnus and it's also convenient for zapping spam tickets on public-facing RT queues. Get it with: git clone http://yrk.nfshost.com/repos/rt-liberation.git/

=== emacs-android.el ===
I write some Android stuff. Some of the Emacs Lisp hacks I write to help me hack Android Java in Emacs find their way into emacs-android.el. You can get a copy with: git clone http://yrk.nfshost.com/repos/emacs-android.git

=== emacs-pmd.el ===
For Emacs integration with PMD (http://pmd.sourceforge.net/), see emacs-pmd.el here: http://yrk.nfshost.com/projects/emacs-pmd/

Bug reports and patches are welcome. Happy hacking.

== Emacs Hacking: Older Projects ==

I'm keeping these around so that people looking for them will still find the code, but I don't work on these for whatever reason.

=== diamondsms.el ===
If you have a VOIP account you can use [http://yrk.nfshost.com/repos/diamondsms/diamondsms.el diamondsms.el] to send SMS' from Emacs. Please note that it currently only works with one provider, namely Diamondcard VOIP. I hope to be able to add more providers, so if you know about any VOIP providers with an SMS API, please contact me. You can pull from the Darcs repository at http://yrk.nfshost.com/repos/diamondsms/.

=== emacs-linphone.el ===
[http://www.linphone.org/ linphone] is GPL'd VOIP software for speech and video. emacs-linphone.el is an Emacs interface to linphone. Get in on the action at: git clone http://yrk.nfshost.com/repos/emacs-linphone.git
