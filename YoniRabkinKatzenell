=== About ===

My name is Yoni Rabkin. I've been using GNU/Emacs ever since I've started using GNU/Linux years ago and have never looked back. I used Emacs to edit my first Linux file when I tried to connect my new GNU/Linux box to the Internet for the first time. I had first read about Emacs in Philip Greenspun's book "Philip and Alex's guide to Web publishing".

I keep a blog at http://yrk.rabkins.net/ where you can find a lot of my GNU/Emacs and Lisp related ramblings.

You can occasionally find me on #emacs as [::yrk].

[http://yrk.nfshost.com My homepage] has a bit more info.

=== Emacs Hacking ===

I have a few patches in GNU/Emacs.

I contribute to the [[EMMS]] project, I wrote parts of it and use it daily. I also (re)wrote most of the Emms manual and designed the logo.

I organize my life using text files in GNU/Emacs and a few simple rules. I'd write more about my technique if anyone asked.

I wrote, and use [http://gitorious.org/wireless wireless.el] for wireless status information.

I wrote [http://yrk.nfshost.com/repos/analog-clock/analog-clock.el analog-clock.el]. It is an animated analog clock (Seven-Segment or turny) for your temporal enjoyment. It should be in GNU/Emacs proper.

I wrote [http://yrk.nfshost.com/repos/vernacular-time/vernacular-time.el vernacular-time.el] to display times stamps in Emacs in the vernacular. It has a useful Dired mode to transform "ls" time stamps. You can pull from the Darcs repository at http://yrk.nfshost.com/repos/vernacular-time/.

If you have a VOIP account you can use [http://yrk.nfshost.com/repos/diamondsms/diamondsms.el diamondsms.el] to send SMS' from Emacs. Please note that it currently only works with one provider, namely Diamondcard VOIP. I hope to be able to add more providers, so if you know about any VOIP providers with an SMS API, please contact me. You can pull from the Darcs repository at http://yrk.nfshost.com/repos/diamondsms/.

[http://www.linphone.org/ linphone] is GPL'd VOIP software for speech and video. emacs-linphone.el is an Emacs interface to linphone. Get in on the action at: git clone http://yrk.nfshost.com/repos/emacs-linphone.git

SLIME, the Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs, displays a MOTD type encouragement when loaded. With [http://yrk.nfshost.com/repos/slime-cl-pitfalls/slime-cl-pitfalls.el slime-cl-pitfalls.el] you will instead be treated with a randomly selected Common Lisp pitfall for your edification. You can pull from the Darcs repository at http://yrk.nfshost.com/repos/slime-cl-pitfalls/.

I wrote and use rt-liberation.el every day. It is an interface to the [http://bestpractical.com/rt/ RT] system. Get it with: git clone http://yrk.nfshost.com/repos/rt-liberation.git/

Some of the Emacs Lisp hacks I wrote to facilitate Android hacking in Emacs found their way into emacs-android.el. You can get a copy with: git clone http://yrk.nfshost.com/repos/emacs-android.git

For Emacs integration with PMD (http://pmd.sourceforge.net/), see emacs-pmd.el here: http://yrk.nfshost.com/projects/emacs-pmd/

Bug reports and patches are welcome. Happy hacking.
