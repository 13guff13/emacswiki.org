=== About ===

My name is Yoni Rabkin. I've been using GNU/Emacs ever since I've started using GNU/Linux years ago and have never looked back. I used Emacs to edit my first Linux file when I tried to connect my new GNU/Linux box to the Internet for the first time. I had first read about Emacs in Philip Greenspun's book "Philip and Alex's guide to Web publishing".

I keep a livejournal at http://www.livejournal.com/users/yrk where you can find a lot of my GNU/Emacs and Lisp related ramblings.

You can occasionally find me on #emacs as [::yrk].

[http://yrk.nfshost.com My homepage] has a bit more info.

=== Emacs Hacking ===

I have a few patches in GNU/Emacs.

I contribute to the [[EMMS]] project, I wrote parts of it and use it daily. I also (re)wrote most of the Emms manual and designed the logo.

I organize my daily tasks with the spartan [[doit-mode.el]].

I use [http://gitorious.org/wireless wireless.el] for wireless status information.

[http://yrk.nfshost.com/repos/analog-clock/analog-clock.el analog-clock.el] is an animated analog clock (Seven-Segment or turny) for your temporal enjoyment.

I wrote [http://yrk.nfshost.com/repos/vernacular-time/vernacular-time.el vernacular-time.el] to display times stamps in Emacs in the vernacular. It has a useful Dired mode to transform "ls" time stamps. You can pull from the Darcs repository at http://yrk.nfshost.com/repos/vernacular-time/.

If you have a VOIP account you can use [http://yrk.nfshost.com/repos/diamondsms/diamondsms.el diamondsms.el] to send SMS' from Emacs. Please note that it currently only works with one provider, namely Diamondcard VOIP. I hope to be able to add more providers, so if you know about any VOIP providers with an SMS API, please contact me. You can pull from the Darcs repository at http://yrk.nfshost.com/repos/diamondsms/.

SLIME, the Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs, displays a MOTD type encouragement when loaded. With [http://yrk.nfshost.com/repos/slime-cl-pitfalls/slime-cl-pitfalls.el slime-cl-pitfalls.el] you will instead be treated with a randomly selected Common Lisp pitfall for your edification. You can pull from the Darcs repository at http://yrk.nfshost.com/repos/slime-cl-pitfalls/.

rt-liberation.el is an interface to the [http://bestpractical.com/rt/ RT] system. Get it with: git clone http://yrk.nfshost.com/repos/rt-liberation.git/

Bug reports and patches are welcome. Happy hacking.
