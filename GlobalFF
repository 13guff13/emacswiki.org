With GlobalFF you can find and open any file on your system within seconds. Literally. It's the iswitchb of opening files (see IswitchBuffers).

It uses ##locate## which is a standard tool on GNU/Linux. Of course, ##locate## has Windows ports, so it should work out-of-the-box on Windows too if ##locate## is installed..

This is developed on GnuEmacs but should work on XEmacs, too.
