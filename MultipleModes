Libraries providing multiple [[MajorMode]]s in a buffer. See also MinorMode.

= mumamo.el =

MuMaMo (short for multiple major modes) is written for Emacs 22. I believe this is the only one that can support NxmlMode/NxhtmlMode. It is distributed as part of [NxhtmlMode nXhtml]; thus if you do web development and need to mix HTML+CSS+JavaScript, Java+HTML (JSP), PHP, ... then [NxhtmlMode nXhtml] is an easy option. It is centered around web development modes and it is not clear how to add custom non-XHTML-ish multimodes, eg. C with embedded SQL.

Why do you think MuMaMo is centered around web development? nXhtml is, but I can't remember that there is anything in MuMaMo that is that.

Please explain what you found unclear about how to add for example C with embedded SQL?

Multiple Major Modes by MichaelAbrahamShulman.
This one is used on the OracleProC page.
It seems to have been the method of choice for combining major modes, but the latest version is now from 2004.
You can find description of using it, together with psgml-mode, php-mode, javascript-mode and css-mode to edit HTML files at HtmlModeDeluxe.

There has been some attempts to get it working with NxmlMode for XHTML, see NxmlModeForXHTML.

= multi-mode.el =

Multi Mode is an implementation of the approach referred to in Emacs' TODO.
It probably only works in Emacs 21.

- I have been using it with Emacs 23 with no issue. It also has 2009 in its copyright notice, so it seems like it is still being updated.

See also its uses in noweb.el and haskell-latex.el in the same directory.

Multiple Major Modes for XEmacs by JerryChen.

= two-mode-mode.el =

Two Mode Mode by DavidWelton.
This one is used for one of the solutions on the PhpMode page.
It seems to be very easy to use.
Just specify the start and end regular expressions for the second mode.

See EmacsLispAndLaTeX for an example.
