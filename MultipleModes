MuMaMo (short for multiple major modes) is written for Emacs 22. It is distributed as part of [NxhtmlMode nXhtml] and can mix HTML+CSS+JavaScript, Java+HTML (JSP), PHP. It can also suport NxmlMode.

= multi-mode.el =

Multi Mode is an implementation of the approach referred to in Emacs' TODO.
It probably only works in Emacs 21.

- I have been using it with Emacs 23 with no issue. It also has 2009 in its copyright notice, so it seems like it is still being updated.

See also its uses in noweb.el and haskell-latex.el in the same directory.

Two Mode Mode by DavidWelton.
This one is used for one of the solutions on the PhpMode page.
It seems to be very easy to use.
Just specify the start and end regular expressions for the second mode.
