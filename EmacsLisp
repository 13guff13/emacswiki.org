Emacs Lisp, or Elisp (see EmacsLispLegalName), is a variant of MacLisp that much of Emacs is written in, as
well as being the extension language that customizations and extensions are written in.

Emacs Lisp is what makes Emacs ExtensibleSoftware. Customizations and
extensions can be made quickly and portably. Some of the ways that
Emacs Lisp is used to extend Emacs include hooking custom Emacs Lisp
functions into events, binding functions to key combinations, and
creating new editing modes.

Lisp has been rumored to stand for Lots of Insignificant Silly
Parentheses, but it really means '''LIS'''t '''P'''rocessor.

To read about other kinds of Lisp and how to use them in conjunction
with Emacs, see CommonLisp and [[Scheme]].

EmacsLispReference is the official documentation.

EmacsLispIntro is a book for non-programmers available from the FreeSoftwareFoundation and is shipped with Emacs.

For help on using other people's Emacs Lisp, see InstallingPackages.

A work-in-progress (perhaps to be perpetually unfinished) tutorial:

* LearnEmacsLisp as a way of LearningEmacs.
* ElispCookbook has a lot of useful short examples.
* EmacsLispComparisons -- Compare Emacs Lisp with other popular languages
* PlainLispForMath for an explanation of simple arithmetic expressions in Lisp
* ListStructure: like ##((1 . 2) . (3 . 4))##
* BackquoteSyntax: what does it mean ##`(foo ,bar baz)##
* ListModification: operations which inspect and modify lists
* [[EmacsLispIntrospection|Introspection]]: finding out about functions
* [[DynamicBindingVsLexicalBinding|Dynamic and Lexical Binding]]: it's common to mix both
* [[ConcurrentEmacs|Concurrency]] through asynchronous processes
* CodingStyle -- For suggestions on Emacs Lisp SelfDocumentation

If you are wondering about all the quoting syntaxes like ##?a 'b #c `(,d e) :f (g . h)## etc., then see at the symbol glossary in CategoryGlossary.
