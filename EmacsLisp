Emacs Lisp, or Elisp (see EmacsLispLegalName), is a variant of MacLisp that much of Emacs is written in, as
well as being the extension language that customizations and extensions are written in.

Emacs Lisp is what makes Emacs ExtensibleSoftware. Customizations and
extensions can be made quickly and portably. Some of the ways that
Emacs Lisp is used to extend Emacs include hooking custom Emacs Lisp
functions into events, binding functions to key combinations, 
creating new editing modes and even writing whole applications for the WorldWideWeb or other Internet clients.

Lisp, originally specified in 1958, derives from '''LIS'''t '''P'''rocessing.  Those turned off by the language's syntax have said it should stand for Lots of Insignificant Silly Parentheses. 

To read about other kinds of Lisp and how to use them in conjunction
with Emacs, see CommonLisp and [[Scheme]].

EmacsLispReference is the official documentation. It is built into Emacs Info pages and is the go-to for most Elisp programmers. It is shipped with Emacs and can be accessed by the menu bar, or with `M-x menu-bar-read-lispref'. 

EmacsLispIntro is a book for non-programmers available from the FreeSoftwareFoundation and is shipped with Emacs. Its command is `M-x menu
