Emacs Lisp (sometimes called [[EmacsLispLegalName|Elisp]]) is a variant of MacLisp that much of Emacs is written in, as
well as being the extension language customizations and extensions are written in.

Emacs Lisp is what makes Emacs ExtensibleSoftware. Customizations and
extensions can be made quickly and portably. Some of the ways that
Emacs Lisp is used to extend Emacs include hooking custom Emacs Lisp
functions into events, binding functions to key combinations, and
creating new editing modes.

Lisp has been rumored to stand for Lots of Insignificant Silly
Parentheses, but it really means LISt Processor.

See also PlainLispForMath for an explanation of simple arithmetic
expressions in Lisp.

To read about other kinds of Lisp and how to use them in conjunction
with Emacs, see CommonLisp and [[Scheme]].

== How to learn Emacs Lisp ==

For Emacs Lisp documentation, see the EmacsLispReference node.  For Emacs Lisp SelfDocumentation, see CodingStyle.

For help on using other people's Emacs Lisp, see InstallingPackages.

An introduction from the FreeSoftwareFoundation: EmacsLispIntro.

A work-in-progress (perhaps to be perpetually unfinished) tutorial:
http://www.gnuvola.org/software/elisp-tutorial/index.html

You might prefer learning by example and then the ElispCookbook would be useful.

You might prefer learning by looking at differences with languages you do know in EmacsLispComparisons.

See also LearningEmacs.

== Emacs Lisp features ==
* ListStructure: like ##((1 . 2) . (3 . 4))##
* BackquoteSyntax: what does it mean ##`(foo ,bar baz)##
* ListModification: operations which inspect and modify lists
* [[EmacsLispIntrospection|Introspection]]: finding out about functions
* [[DynamicBindingVsLexicalBinding|Dynamic and Lexical Binding]]: it's common to mix both

If you are wondering about all the quoting syntaxes like ##?a 'b #c `(,d e) :f (g . h)## etc., then see at the symbol glossary in CategoryGlossary.
