How to configure [[ELIM]].

== Directories ==

The default situation is that the icons are stored in a sibling directory and the elim-client is stored in the parent directory of the source files.

One way to do it:

{{{
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp/elim")
(autoload 'garak "garak" nil t)
}}}

Put the Elisp (elim.el, garak.el, lui.el, incomplete.el) files in ~/elisp/elim.

Put the elim-client file in ~/elisp.

Put the icons directory in ~/elisp; all the images such as away.png etc. are therefore in ~/elisp/icons.
