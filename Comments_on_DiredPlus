Am I missing something, or does this page not mention how to setup dired+ for use?

Perhaps the default diredp-compressed-extensions today should also have "xz" and "lzma"?

@[[xuhdev]]: I don't see why, a priori.  But if you provide (good) reasons then I'll consider them. (You can of course customize the value.) Here are lists of possible compressed-file extensions: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_archive_formats.
