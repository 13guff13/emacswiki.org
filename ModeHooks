Mode hooks make it so you can always set up a mode in a particular way.

For example, if you want to have AutoFillMode on by default in text mode, add this to your DotEmacs file:

 (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)

That ones easy, because there's a premade function for us, "turn-on-auto-fill."

But only a very few are like that. For the rest, you'll probably want to use LambdaFunctions.

 (add-hook 'text-mode-hook (lambda () (set-fill-column 72)))
 (add-hook 'text-mode-hook (lambda () (column-number-mode 1)))

How do you know what to put in place of 'text-mode-hook'?

I'm not sure what will always work, but the following has worked for me:

* Look at the name of the major mode. (Working in bash, it's "Shell-script.")
* Type C-h v, for variable help.
* Start typing the name of the major mode.
* Hit "?", and look for something that ends with "hook." That's probably it.

See SaveLog for a simple example of using hooks.

See ManagingHookVariables for more sophisticated ways of adding hooks.

See ChangeHook to use `after-change-functions' and `before-change-functions' for evil hackery (electrifying user input).


=== Clearing Hooks ===

To clear all hooks for a given hook, set the hook variable to <code>nil</code>:

  (setq focus-out-hook nil)
