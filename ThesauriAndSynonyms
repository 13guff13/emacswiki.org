This page is about obtaining information about natural-language synonyms within Emacs. In other words, it's about thesauri.

A thesaurus generally groups words and phrases into classes of synonyms. In English, the classic, model thesaurus is Roget's Thesaurus.

More generally, any set of equivalence classes of strings might be thought of as a thesaurus, and the members of each equivalence class can be thought of as synonyms of each other. Another way to describe this is as a set of catalogs.

Because of this generality, you can also use thesaurus functionality (looking up synonyms) for things like spell-checking and even as a part of a personal information manager (PDA).

The following pages on %%EmacsWiki%% provide Emacs thesaurus functionalities or make some mention of using thesauri or manipulating synonyms:

* [[Synonyms]] -- Library Lisp:synonyms.el.  Search for synonyms, with regexps and [[Icicles]] [[completion]]
* [[Icicles]] Complete a partial word to a word or phrase in a thesaurus
* Library Lisp:mthesaur.el -- search for synonyms
* [http://williamxu.net9.org/ref/wordnet.el wordnet.el] -- Browse the Word-Net dictionary (broken)
* ShawnBoyette -- Mention of Wroget
* [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/thesaurus.el thesaurus] -- Use BigHugeLabs to lookup synonyms, and maybe replace word-at-point
