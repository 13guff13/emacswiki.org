A thesaurus is a database for NaturalLanguage. It presents lists of synonyms for words and phrases. For the English language, the best-known thesaurus is Roget's Thesaurus. Thesauri have been used by careful writers for ever.  

== Summary ==

Generally, any set of equivalence classes of strings might be thought of as a thesaurus, and the members of each equivalence class can be thought of as synonyms of each other. Another way to describe this is as a set of catalogs.

The following pages on %%EmacsWiki%% provide Emacs thesaurus commands or make some mention of using thesauri or manipulating synonyms:

* [[Synonyms]] -- Library Lisp:synonyms.el.  Search for synonyms, with regexps and [[Icicles]] [[completion]]
* [[Icicles]] Complete a partial word to a word or phrase in a thesaurus
* Library Lisp:mthesaur.el -- search for synonyms
* [http://williamxu.net9.org/ref/wordnet.el wordnet.el] -- Browse the Word-Net dictionary (broken)
* ShawnBoyette -- Mention of Wroget
* Lisp:thesaurus.el  -- lookup synonyms on BigHugeLabs.com, and maybe replace word-at-point.
