Generally, ''any'' set of equivalence classes of strings (''any'' strings) can be considered a '''[::thesaurus]''', and the members of each equivalence class can be thought of as '''[::synonym]s''' of each other. 

A thesaurus is typically used for words and phrases of a NaturalLanguage. For English, the best-known thesaurus is ''Roget's Thesaurus''. Thesauri have long been used by careful writers.  

The following pages provide thesaurus features or make some use of a thesaurus or synonyms:

* [[Synonyms]] -- Library <tt>[[synonyms.el]]</tt>.  Search or browse for synonyms, including with [[regexp]]s and [[Icicles|Icicles completion]]. Substitute any thesaurus (in the accepted format), including one you create.
