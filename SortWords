Sorting words in a [[region]] can be done with:

  (defun sort-words (reverse beg end)
    "Sort words in region alphabetically, in REVERSE if negative.
  Prefixed with negative \\[universal-argument], sorts in reverse.

  The variable `sort-fold-case' determines whether alphabetic case
  affects the sort order.

  See `sort-regexp-fields'."
    (interactive "P\nr")
    (sort-regexp-fields reverse "\\w+" "\\&" beg end))

Running `M-x sort-words' on:

  first, second, third - last.

produces:

  first, last, second - third.

and reversing the order can be done with `C-u M-x sort-words':

  third, second, last - first.

See ReverseWords for reversing the order of words as they appear, regardless of lexographical information.
