All the search issues on EmacsWikiProblems make me think that perhaps we'd be better off using DuckDuckGo?
Apparently, [http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/03/changes_to_the.html Bruce Schneier uses it].
If you feel like trying it, I've added a second search box to the site that you can activate:

* http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/?action=browse;id=2013-05-07;duckduckgo=1 -- enable it
* http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/?action=browse;id=2013-05-07;duckduckgo=0 -- disable it

I've also added a menu item to the _Administration_ section (link at the bottom of every page).
Report back if you notice any problems.
