In Emacs documentation, [[key sequence]] notation can be confusing for an EmacsNewbie. Here is an overview:

; C-: means (press and hold) the Control key
; M-: means the [[Meta]] key (the Alt key, on most keyboards)
; S-: means the Shift key (e.g. `S-TAB' means Shift Tab)
; DEL: means the Backspace key (''not'' the Delete key)
; RET: means the Return or Enter key
; SPC: means the Space bar
; ESC: means the Escape key
; TAB: means the Tab key

A notation such as `C-M-' (or, equivalently, `M-C') means press and hold ''both'' Control and Meta (Alt) keys.

See the section "Kinds of User Input" in the EmacsManual ([[Manual:User Input]]).
