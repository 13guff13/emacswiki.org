== Emacs and MIDI ==

Many people are using Emacs for many music related tasks, be it editing csound files, lilypond files, or playing mp3:s with emms.

It would also be interesting to be able to use emacs as a soundtracker-like environment.
That is, edit midi-data in the form of a text based piano roll, and also play it with a real-time updated cursor
that highlight all notes currenly being played.

It is perhaps noteworthy that Emacs can open Midi devices directly using

    (make-serial-process :speed nil ...)

and operate on them using the normal I/O operators also available for terminal processes.
