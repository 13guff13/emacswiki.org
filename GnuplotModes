There are now two different modes for editing Gnuplot files. 

== gnuplot-mode (Gnuplot 3.8 compatible) ==
The original gnuplot-mode, compatible with Gnuplot 3.8, last updated december 13, 2002. Extensive support for menues, and many key-bindings. See GnuplotMode for further details.


== gnuplot-mode (Gnplot 4.6 compatible) ==
A more recent version, with syntax highlighting (compatible with most recent Gnuplot 4.6 addtions such as do-for, else, while, if loops ), and compilation buffer usage, for easy navigation between errors.
