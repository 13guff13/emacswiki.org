''Great news!'' Thanks for all the work, Alex & Nic.

I still cannot get to the Elisp files, however. I go to ElispArea, click the `Downloading' link in the TOC, then the link `Alphabetical list of all Elisp libraries on this Wiki' (URL: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=elisp-area;context=0), and I just get (eventually): 

  504 Gateway Time-out

  nginx/1.4.6 (Ubuntu)

Am I not doing something I should? I closed all browser windows and cleared the browser cache as well. I'm using Google Chrome at the moment.

Thx -- DrewAdams
