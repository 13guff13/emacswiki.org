''Great news!'' Thanks for all the work, Alex & Nic.

I still cannot get to the Elisp files, however. I go to ElispArea, click the `Downloading' link in the TOC, then the link `Alphabetical list of all Elisp libraries on this Wiki' (URL: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=elisp-area;context=0), and I just get (eventually): 

  504 Gateway Time-out

  nginx/1.4.6 (Ubuntu)

Am I not doing something I should? I closed all browser windows and cleared the browser cache as well. I'm using Google Chrome at the moment.

Thx -- DrewAdams

Thanks; I wasn't sure if I was missing something.

FYI, just in case you are not aware of it: 

At least some Elisp pages do not appear as code but as if they were HTML. E.g., http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/palette.el.

Some other libraries show the same problem, but some appear OK. Not sure what the difference is.

HTH.

Hm, I have no idea why these files "lost" their formatting. When I edited the file and hit the Preview button, it looked OK, so all I did was edit the file and append a newline. Now it's back to normal. Weird.

I see. Thanks for taking a look. There are other files with the same problem. I tried to fix `bookmark+-1.el' the same way, for instance, but I got `504 Gateway Time-out' when I tried to save it. I guess I'll just need to wait a bit for this.

FYI - I was able to fix `bookmark+-1.el', by trying again. I guess it must be borderline wrt the timeout.

Hm, we should keep an eye on 504 errors just in case that's an issue between the caching proxy (nginx) and the web server (apache).
