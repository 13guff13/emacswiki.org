''Great news!'' Thanks for all the work, Alex & Nic.

I still cannot get to the Elisp files, however. I go to ElispArea, click the `Downloading' link in the TOC, then the link `Alphabetical list of all Elisp libraries on this Wiki' (URL: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=elisp-area;context=0), and I just get (eventually): 

  504 Gateway Time-out

  nginx/1.4.6 (Ubuntu)

Am I not doing something I should? I closed all browser windows and cleared the browser cache as well. I'm using Google Chrome at the moment.

Thx -- DrewAdams

Thanks; I wasn't sure if I was missing something.

FYI, just in case you are not aware of it: 

At least some Elisp pages do not appear as code but as if they were HTML. E.g., http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/palette.el.

Some other libraries show the same problem, but some appear OK. Not sure what the difference is.

HTH.

Hm, I have no idea why these files "lost" their formatting. When I edited the file and hit the Preview button, it looked OK, so all I did was edit the file and append a newline. Now it's back to normal. Weird.
