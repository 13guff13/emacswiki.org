RunSchemeHere is a CmuScheme extension that allows you to easily run multiple inferior scheme processes. 

(run-scheme-here) starts a new inferior process in the current buffer's directory. If there is one running already, then it switches to its buffer.

The scheme-mode-map is also extended with bindings to send expressions to the buffer-local inferior process.
