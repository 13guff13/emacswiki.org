Here's what I use to manually shuffle playlists:

    (defun my-randomize-buffer ()
      (interactive)
      (let ((lines (split-string (buffer-string) "\n")))
        (erase-buffer)
        (insert (mapconcat 'identity
                           (sort* lines (lambda (&rest ignore) (> (random 2) 0)))
                           "\n")
                "\n")))
