<b>This page should really be named /nXhtml/ since it is about the whole nXhtml package. nxhtml-mode is just a part of that package.</b>

[new]
: To download nXhtml go to [http://ourcomments.org/Emacs/nXhtml/doc/nxhtml.html nXhtml homepage]. It is also included in [[EmacsW32]].
: You can also download nXhtml directly from the repository (without bzr). To do that download the file [http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~nxhtml/nxhtml/main/annotate/head%3A/web-vcs.el web-vcs.el] and eval it (i.e. open the file and do <b>M-x eval-buffer</b>). Then do <b>M-x web-vcs-nxhtml</b>. This can be used both for initial download and updating.
: With the web download I now recommend downloading part by part if you like it. I have the impression that many wanted a smaller download than the whole of nXhtml. Here you have it!
: To report a bug go to https://bugs.launchpad.net/nxhtml.

**Newest features** (see [http://ourcomments.org/Emacs/nXhtml/doc/nxhtml-changes.html#latest changelog]):
* A new library bibhlp.el to make it easy to handle bibliographic references in for example org-mode. Only in the repository yet. (Yes, it has nothing to do with web-development and it will move on later I hope... ;-)
* Web download directly from Emacs (without bzr, instead using *web-vcs.el*, see above)
* Support for the new JavaScriptMode mode in CVS Emacs (called js-mode, formerly known as Espresso mode).
* Chunks in chunks
* Inline images for html, org-mode, css-mode etc.
* Preview as you type in Firefox (but rather slow - additions are welcome), find out where an element is in Firefox
* You can now use hi-lock with Mumamo multi major modes.
* Mumamo region chunks, which is temporarily chunks you add yourself with any major mode. You just hilight the region and decide what major mode it should have.
* Fetch and start using the latest development version of [EmacsCodeBrowser ECB] right now!



== Description ==

'''[::nXhtml]''' is a package that may help for web development, but it also contains a lot of other things.
For an overview see [http://ourcomments.org/Emacs/nXhtml/doc/nxhtml.html nXhtml home
page].
You may also find the [http://ourcomments.org/Emacs/nXhtml/tut/tutorials.html tutorials] useful.

One of the main parts is the major mode nxhtml-mode for editing XHTML files (based on NxmlMode).
This gives XHTML completion of tags and attributes also in for example php files (even if they do not contain XML + DTD specifications).

Another main part handles [[MultipleModes|multiple major modes]] (using MuMaMo).
It defines *multi major modes*, often with names
like /html-mumamo/, /nxhtml-mumamo/, /eruby-html-mumamo/, /django-html-mumamo/,
/genshi-nxhtml-mumamo/, /smarty-html-mumamo/ etc.
Those modes handle inlined style sheets and javascript, php, jsp etc, which are interleaved with the HTML.


There are a lot of other features like simple search and replace in directory trees, simple file upload, etc.
The only way to find out is to download nXhtml and try.

[:ScreenShots]
Some images showing a bit of the nXhtml functionality (try it out if you wonder more):

=== Quick Start ===

Installation is easy, just unzip the archive and (just as README.txt says) add one line to your .emacs:

  (load "YOUR-PATH-TO/nxhtml/autostart")

After this nXhtml is ready for use.
However for a little more and where to download it see
[http://ourcomments.org/Emacs/nXhtml/doc/nxhtml.html#qg the Quick Guide to nXhtml].
See [http://ourcomments.org/Emacs/nXhtml/doc/nxhtml-changes.html nXhtml Notes and Changes]
for a list of changes. You can also [http://ourcomments.org/Emacs/DL/elisp/nxhtml/beta/ try a beta].

Note that if you have [[EmacsW32]] then nXhtml is already included, but you have to turn it on. And you may want to update to a more recent version of nXhtml. (If you do just put it in the same location where the old version was.)

You need **Emacs 22** or later to use nXhtml.

----

=== Changing file associations ===

These are defined in /nxhtml/nxhtml/nxhtml-autoload.el in the function nxhtml-setup-file-assoc, so just modify 'auto-mode-alist as normal.

== Libraries included in the package nXhtml ==

**nXhtml** comes with a lot of elisp libraries, some of which you can use separately.
I used to have a list here, but I always forget to update that so I have removed it.
Please download the whole library if you are interested in some special pieces.
Or, pick them from the 
[http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~nxhtml/nxhtml/main/files/head%3A/ latest version sources on Launchpad] (this may be a beta version though).

Note: Some of the files used to be here on Emacs Wiki too, but I decided to delete them since the latest version of them are now easily available from there.
The files I have deleted are 
ediff-url.el,
freemind.el,
tabkey2.el and
w32-print.el.

The preferred way to report bugs are now https://bugs.launchpad.net/nxhtml.
See that page for current bug status.
(You may also enter bugs below under Unsolved problems, but it is much better if you use the bug database.)

If you want to report a bug please use <i>M-x nxhtml-report-bug</i> to get instructions.

Old solved bugs that was reported on Emacs Wiki are here: NxhtmlOldBugs

=== Frequently Asked Questions ===

There is now a FAQ section on Launchpad: https://answers.launchpad.net/nxhtml/+faqs

== Comments and Questions ==

Please use the bug database if you can, see above, <i>because I seldom look here and will miss both questions and replies!</i>

=== Solved problems ===
==== Syntax colouring colours? ====
[new] How is one supposed to customize the colours of syntax colouring? Yes, I know "M-x customize-group RET mumamo RET". But which fecking value? customize-face doesn't seem appropriate, since the current face is mumamo-somehting-background.

[new]
Syntax colours are part of Emacs, not nXhtml. If you want to customize them do

  M-x customize-group RET font-lock-faces RET


----
=== Unsolved problems ===

==== C indentation styles ====
[new]
How is one supposed to set the indentation width? The brace style?

[new]
Indentation: As usual in Emacs, but there are also some indentation specific to multi major modes. Do "M-x customize-group RET mumamo RET" to change them.

[new]
Brace style: I do not understand the question. Could you please rephrase it?

[new]
Sorry. This actually kind of refers to the "child" php-mode (in my case). When using php-mode alone, I can do
<code>
(c-set-style "bsd")
</code>
in my php-mode startup hook function to ensure braces are automagically put in the correct (%%*cough*%%) places, i.e.
{{{
    function foo()
    {
      ...
    }
}}}
Trying to do this in the nxhtml-mode-hook causes an error. I guess I'm supposed to somehow set them in the "child" mode, but how, please?

[new]
I think it might work setting it in the major mode hook. Could you please test that?

==== Chunks in chunks - where does it end? ====

I have moved this to a bug report on Launchpad, please add any new comments to it there: https://bugs.launchpad.net/nxhtml/+bug/569742


==== File extensions and major mode selection ====

Downloading the zip and following the instructions works for me, except they seem to suggest that after you run autostart.el, every time you start emacs with an "example .html" extension, that would somehow load the file and set the right mode. This is simply not the case in my experience. However adding this at the end worked:

{{{
(load "nxhtml/autostart.el")
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.html$" . nxhtml-mode))
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.shtml$" . nxhtml-mode))
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.htm$" . nxhtml-mode))
}}}

I wish the instructions were a bit clearer..
[new] You and me both :(

[new]
And I would like a bug report to understand where the problem is... ;-)
