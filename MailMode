The mail-mode is a mode for writing mails. It's useful when you use Emacs as mail/news editor for other programs (e.g. mutt, slrn, tin).

The mail-mode is defined in sendmail.el which is part of Emacs and included in the mail-lib package of XEmacs.

To active the mode just type <code>M-x mail-mode</code>

A alternative is the PostMode, and MessageMode for [[Gnus]] users.

== Configuration ==

Here are some typical settings:

<pre>
(add-hook 'mail-mode-hook          'turn-on-auto-fill)
(add-hook 'mail-mode-hook          'mail-abbrevs-setup)
(setq mail-yank-prefix "> "
      mail-signature "\n\n-- \nhttp://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/AlexSchroeder"
      mail-default-headers "FCC: ~/SENT\n")
</pre>

= colorizing multiply-quoted lines =

If you want to have the lines of an e-mail colorized differently depending on how many levels of quoting (instead of just one color for all quoted text), you can use this hook (after you've defined the faces):

  (add-hook 'mail-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            (font-lock-add-keywords nil
               '(("^[ \t]*>[ \t]*>[ \t]*>.*$"
                  (0 'mail-multiply-quoted-text-face))
                 ("^[ \t]*>[ \t]*>.*$"
                  (0 'mail-double-quoted-text-face))))))
