The mail-mode is a mode for writing mails. It's useful when you use Emacs as mail/news editor for other programs (e.g. mutt, slrn, tin).

The mail-mode is defined in sendmail.el which is part of Emacs and included in the mail-lib package of XEmacs.

To active the mode just type <code>M-x mail-mode</code>

A alternative is the PostMode, and MessageMode for [[Gnus]] users.

== Configuration ==

Here are some typical settings:

<pre>
(add-hook 'mail-mode-hook          'turn-on-auto-fill)
(add-hook 'mail-mode-hook          'mail-abbrevs-setup)
(setq mail-yank-prefix "> "
      mail-signature "\n\n-- \nhttp://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/AlexSchroeder"
      mail-default-headers "FCC: ~/SENT\n")
</pre>
