I'm currently porting GNU Emacs 21.2 to OpenVMS 7.3-1, and
summarizing progress in this space.  When the work is done,
only build tips will remain.  --ttn

; Current status: Rather than make everyone wait while I puzzle
out the copyright status of old VMS-specific files, I've decided to
expose the work-in-progress so others can play, too.
Details are available on the Emacs for VMS homepage:
** http://www.gnuvola.org/software/emacs-for-vms/

; What works (that is, reproducibly w/o too much manual tweaking): Configuration,
"dump", file read/write, byte compilation, timers and unixoid select(2)
emulation, multiple subprocesses (synch and asynch -- implies dired, comint,
compile, and so forth), colors on console, filename completion (with "magic"
right square brace and slash keybindings), network
operations via open-network-stream.  Yes, that means M-x zone in color over
ssh from a VMS box.  <I>"When the going gets weird, the weird turn pro."</I> (HST)

; Release methodology: The "public releases" will actually be in the form
of checking things into the GNU CVS repositories, updating the Emacs for
VMS page, and making the occasional announcement to gnu-emacs-sources.

; Commentary: Feel free to ignore the lunatic ramblings in this section.

* (2004-04-02) In debugging next-error (for M-x compile), I notice
that var compilation-error-regexp-alist for Emacs 19.28 used to
support specification of a function to do further parsing, beyond
that which func compilation-parse-errors would do.  Dropping this
support makes for a cleaner design, evidently.  Parsing must be one
of the least-loved branches of computer science.
* (2004-05-01) I asked the GNU Autoconf maintainers for vms-branch write
privs but the response was not encouraging, so I've decided to publish
"Autoconf for VMS" independently until a time (if any) when merging
maintenance efforts becomes desirable.

* (2005-03-22) There is a Bourne shell script PREP-ZIP available
in the distribution directory that can be used to perform the first
half of the bootstrap relatively painlessly (on unixoid hosts).  Observant
readers will notice a workaround for a methodology bug in the script.

Field Reports

Since there is no mailing list, this section is for those intrepid spirits
wishing to share experiences and tips building Emacs for VMS.

* Autoconf for VMS requires GNU m4, and has been tested with Richard Levitte's
port of GNU m4 version 1.2.  Newer versions may or may not work.  There is now
a directory "m4" w/ source and an Alpha binary in the Autoconf for VMS
distribution dir.
