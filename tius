Much more than you can think. Try asking.

From 2006 to June 2011 I've been using <b>gNewSense</b>, from June 2011 using <b>Trisquel</b>, and I'm very satisfied.

I use <b>Emacs</b>

This is my [http://tius.it/.emacs .emacs] file

== Blog ==

I don't have a blog. I am a reader, not a writer  ;-)
It may be that sometimes you find something here: [http://tius.it/blog Blob] but no hope too much.


How I use <b>Emacs</b>:

== Internet relay chat ==

ERC: for chat on FreeSoftware in LibrePlanet Italia channel [#lp-it]


== Microblogging ==

Identica-mode: for write and follow posts on Identi.ca Microblogging service


== Music Player ==

EMMS: to listen good music when I work on PC
