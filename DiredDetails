This page describes libraries Lisp:dired-details.el and Lisp:dired-details+.el, which let you hide or show the file and directory details in a Dired listing, to save space and clutter. When details are hidden, all you see (and all IncrementalSearch sees) are the file names.

== dired-details.el ==

RobGiardina has written library <tt>[[dired-details.el]]</tt>, which lets you hide and show the details of each file or directory in DiredMode. You use 
`'''<tt>(</tt>'''' to show details and `'''<tt>)</tt>'''' to hide them. 

Hiding details reduces a verbose directory listing such as this:

       -rw-r--r--   1 rgiardin svrtech     4141 Aug 23 17:07 dired-details.el
       -rw-r--r--   1 rgiardin svrtech       56 Aug 23 17:07 linked-file.el -> /var/tmp/checkouts/linked-file.el

to just this:

       [...] dired-details.el
       [...] linked-file.el -> [...]

or to just this, if you set `dired-details-hidden-string' to ##""## instead of ##"[...]"##:

       dired-details.el
       linked-file.el ->

[:Screenshots]
== Screenshots ==

Here are two screenshots, one showing details, one hiding them:

The difference in [[Frame]] size is due to the automatic frame resizing provided by <tt>[[dired-details+.el]]</tt> (see [[#DiredDetailsPlus]]).

[:DiredDetailsPlus]
== Dired Details Plus ==

Library <tt>[[dired-details+.el]]</tt> provides some minor but convenient enhancements to <tt>[[dired-details.el]]</tt>. It loads <tt>dired-details.el</tt> and activates show/hide, so <tt>dired-details+.el</tt> is all you ever need to load.

##dired-details+.el## provides the following enhancements:

* It binds `dired-details-toggle' to both `##)##' and `##(##', so you don't need to remember which shows and which hides.

* It lets you optionally propagate the current hide/show setting to the next DiredMode buffer (option `dired-details-propagate-flag'). If non-`nil', future Dired buffers you open use the hide/show appearance that you last had.

* It makes DiredMode commands that byte-compile, compress, rename, and create files or directories also update the hide/show overlays accordingly. Without this enhancement, for instance, even with details hidden, creating a new file lists it with details showing.

* It automatically shrink-wraps a one-window Dired frame whenever you show/hide details (if you also load library Lisp:autofit-frame.el). See the screenshots above ([[#Screenshots]]).

== Dired-Details and WDired ==

When editing file names with `dired-toggle-read-only' and committing, everything works as expected, but if changes are aborted details are displayed until the listing is refreshed.

== Discussion ==

It would be good if when copying text from a dired buffer with details hidden, the details are not also copied (which is what happens at the moment), e.g. when sending somebody a message with a list of filenames.
