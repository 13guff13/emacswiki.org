"There exist hundreds of Emacs Lisp libraries but GNU Emacs does not contain a package manager allowing users to easily install those libraries and keep them up-to-date.

There is a list of package managers on CategoryCode that have been created to fill this gap."

This isn't true anymore is it? I'm not really knowledgeable on these yet but there's Marmalade (http://marmalade-repo.org/) and package.el (https://github.com/technomancy/package.el) which comes with Emacs 24 out of the box.
