"There exist hundreds of Emacs Lisp libraries but GNU Emacs does not contain a package manager allowing users to easily install those libraries and keep them up-to-date.

There is a list of package managers on CategoryCode that have been created to fill this gap."

This isn't true anymore is it? I'm not really knowledgeable on these yet but there's Marmalade (http://marmalade-repo.org/) and package.el (https://github.com/technomancy/package.el) which comes with Emacs 24 out of the box.

Ajife is full of uncertainty, but three things are constant: death, taxes, and insurance. Without insurance, QuotesChimp would not be able to purchase our homes, since no bank would give us the money. Without insurance, many people would not dare to drive a car because of the high financial risk should there be an accident. Without insurance, "The Force" could not be with us, because the film Star Wars would never have been made. Without inï¿½surance, life and commerce as we know it could not exist.
