== Mode-Line Position ==

This page describes library <tt>[[modeline-posn.el]]</tt>, which provides extensions to the standard Emacs variable `mode-line-position' for Emacs 22 and later. That variable governs the behavior of minor modes `line-number-mode',  `column-number-mode', and `size-indication-mode', which show/hide the current line number, column number, and buffer size, respectively, in the [[mode line]].

The following extensions are provided by library ##modeline-posn.el##:

* In TransientMarkMode, when the [[region]] is [[active region|active]], the size indicated is that of the region, not the [[buffer]]. This portion of the mode-line is then highlighted with face `region'.

* Whenever the current column is greater than ‘modelinepos-column-limit’, the column-number indication in the mode-line is highlighted in face `font-lock-function-name-face'. This lets you know when you've gone past a certain number of characters in any line. You can customize user option ‘modelinepos-column-limit’, and you can bind it to different values in different modes.

This is really handy. Thanks! One request for enhancement: add a customization variable to allow us to use a face other than `font-lock-function-name-face'.  My modeline is blue and my `font-lock-function-name-face' is also blue, so that particular face isn't a good choice for me. --AmitPatel

Would it be possible to optionally display the absolute value of point even while not in TransientMarkMode? -- [[Priyadarshan]]

Sorry, but I think that if you want something like that it should be as an extension of `line-number-mode' and/or `column-number-mode'.  Showing [[point]] as an option makes sense regardless of whether the [[region]] is [[active region|active]].

Of course, as soon as point is shown someone will also want to see [[mark]]...

If you want to do this kind of thing, just take a look at the code in <tt>[[modeline-posn.el]]</tt>, in particular the redefinition of `mode-line-position'.  The parts to tweak are those for `line-number-mode' and `column-number-mode' (one or both, depending on what you want).  HTH -- DrewAdams
