Key-chord lets you bind commands to combination of key-strokes.
Here a "key chord" means two keys pressed simultaneously,
or a single key quickly pressed twice. (*)

The same keys used by their own (or with other keys not defined
as key chords) retain their original command bindings.

There are some info and examples in the elisp-file.

* Lisp:key-chord.el

(*) (In other emacs related texts, pressing SHIFT and/or
META plus another key is sometimes call a "[[chord]]", but not here.
However SHIFT plus _two_ normal keys might be a "key chord".)

A thumb is a finger of the strongest! Let's utilize a thumb.
Small hack to define a key-chord starting with Space.

Lisp:space-chord.el  -- [[rubikitch]]

key-chord and space-chord both looked interesting to me.  space-chord didn't seem to want to work at all, but I didn't investigate that at all.

key-chord seems to pick up my typing as chords.  I tried setting key-chord-two-keys-delay and key-chord-one-key-delay to lower values.  I halved them a few times, I had key-chord-two-keys-delay down to 0.0125.  Maybe I just type too fast, or maybe the effective delay can only go so low.

Pat: I would recommend you avoid combinations that are even slightly common in your writing (prose or programming). See the "Tips" commentary in the source. When you have decided on a candidate ("xy"), check it on your own texts with this command (on any non-windows computer):

 egrep -R --include='*.txt' --include='*.cc' 'xy|yx' .
