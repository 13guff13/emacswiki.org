Hi, I'm Rick.

I'm a new Emacs user, and by contributing to this wiki I hope to
learn more about the application and people who use it.

Most of what I contribute here is also available on my homepage, http://statemachine.co
in blog-post form.

You can contact me using mailto:rick@statemachine.co

I use Emacs.
