So some content here needs work.   So lets make this happen.  

One of the ways I can see doing this is through a top down approach, by setting up a bunch of "wiki projects" with some discreet goals in mind, and any who are interested in that project picking a goal, and working with it.

How can you contribute to a project?
* Add some todo items if you think you have some good ideas on how to improve a particular project
* Pick one of the todo items and get cracking!

=== JavaScript Project ===

==== Ideas, and todo list ====
* Make a central JavaScript page of sorts, outlining various javascript projects, pacakges, etc that are available for emacs
* clean up Js2Mode
* Clean JavaScriptMode, this one is going to need a lot of work
* Clean out any old pages that are no longer applicable, SelenEmacs is a good for-instance
