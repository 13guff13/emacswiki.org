== Tripping with Icicles ==

Among the more useful [[multi-command]]s are those whose actions take
you to some location indicated by the completion candidate.  This
is the way commands such as `icicle-bookmark', `icicle-find-tag',
`icicle-Info-goto-node', and `icicle-occur' work -- you can use
`next' and so on to move among candidates to choose them to act
on, but when you act on them '''Icicles''' takes you to the places they
name.

So just holding down both the Control key and `next' takes you
from one place to the next.  And `C-mouse-2' takes you directly to
the location you click.  Typically, `C-g' aborts the trip and puts
you back at your starting point.

There are many such '''Icicles''' '''[::tripping]''' (aka navigation or browsing) commands, and they all work
similarly.  They give you the normal cycling behavior provided by
vanilla Emacs commands such as `find-tag' (via `##M-.##', `##C-u M-.##',
`##M-*##' etc.) or `set-mark-command' (via `##C-u C-SPC##').  But unlike
the vanilla Emacs commands, the keys for this cycling are always
the same.

More importantly, you ''need not'' cycle through all possibilities.
You can go directly to particular locations with `C-RET',
`C-mouse-2' or using [[completion]].  And your input filters the
available candidates, as always.  And you can, as always, use
[[progressive completion]], [[Icicles - Nutshell View#ChippingAway|chipping away]], and so on to define your
`C-next' trip itinerary using a process of refinement.

Whereas vanilla Emacs gives you some commands that let you use
''completion'' to enter a destination and go there, and it gives you
other commands that let you ''cycle'' among locations, '''Icicles''' rolls
all of that into one.  And you use the same keys, always, to
navigate.

Here are some of the '''Icicles''' tripping commands:

* '''`icicle-bookmark'''' (`C-- C-x r m') -- Trip among [[bookmark]]s.
* '''`icicle-buffer'''' (`C-x b') -- Trip among [[buffer]]s.
* '''`icicle-compilation-search'''' (`##C-c `##') -- Trip among `grep' hits.
* '''`icicle-find-file'''' (`C-x C-f') -- Trip among files.
* '''`icicle-find-file-absolute'''' (`C-u C-x C-f') -- Trip among files.
* '''`icicle-find-file-in-tags-table'''' -- Trip among the files listed in the current [[TagsFile|tags table]] (think "project")
* '''`icicle-find-first-tag'''' (`##C-x 4 .##') -- Trip among [[tag]] hits.
* '''`icicle-find-tag'''' (`##M-.##') -- Trip among tag hits.
* '''`icicle-goto-global-marker'''' (`C-- C-x C-SPC') -- Trip among
  global [[marker]]s.
* '''`icicle-goto-marker'''' (`C-- C-SPC') -- Trip among local markers.
* '''`icicle-imenu'''' (`##C-c =##'), '''`icicle-imenu-command'''',
  '''`icicle-imenu-non-interactive-function'''' -- Trip among
  definitions.
* '''`icicle-Info-goto-node'''' (`g' in Info)-- Trip among [[InfoMode|Info]] nodes.
* '''`icicle-Info-index'''' (`i' in Info) -- Trip among Info nodes. 
* '''`icicle-Info-menu'''' (`m' in Info)-- Trip among Info nodes.
* '''`icicle-locate-file'''' -- Trip among files.
* '''`icicle-occur'''' (`##C-c '##') -- Trip among `occur' hits
   (`icicle-search' among single-line hits).
* '''`icicle-recent-file'''' -- Trip among [[RecentFiles|recent files]].
* '''`icicle-search'''' (`##C-c `##') -- Trip among [[regexp]] search hits.
* '''`icicle-search-char-property'''' -- Trip among buffer strings with
  some [[text property]] or [[overlay]] property.
* '''`icicle-search-keywords'''' (`##C-c ^##') -- Trip among keyword search
  hits.
* '''`icicle-search-overlay-property'''' -- Trip among buffer strings
  with some [[overlay]] property.
* '''`icicle-search-region'''' -- Trip among saved [[region]]s.
* '''`icicle-search-text-property'''' (`##C-c "##') -- Trip among buffer
  strings with some [[text property]].
* '''`icicle-search-word'''' (`##C-c $##') -- Trip among word-search hits.
* '''`icicle-select-frame'''' (`C-x 5 o') -- Trip among [[frame]]s, by name.
* '''`icicle-select-region'''' (`C-u C-x C-x') -- Trip among saved
  regions.
* '''`icicle-select-window'''' (`C-0 C-x o') -- Trip among [[window]]s, by
  buffer name.


[:HighlightingDestination]
=== Highlighting the Destination ===

Starting with Emacs 22, the '''Icicles''' commands that have single
positions as their trip visits (e.g. `icicle-bookmark',
`icicle-Info-goto-node', `icicle-goto-marker', `icicle-find-tag')
highlight those positions temporarily as they are visited.  Except
for the '''Icicles''' search commands, this highlighting is provided by
library <tt>[[crosshairs.el]]</tt>.  If ##crosshairs.el## and the libraries it
requires are not in your `load-path', then no such highlighting
occurs.  See CrosshairHighlighting. Here's a screenshot showing the effect:

[[image:CrosshairHighlightingImage]]

The commands that have regions as their trip visits (e.g. `icicle-select-region') highlight the currently visited region if you use TransientMarkMode (or, e.g., DeleteSelectionMode).

The commands that employ '''Icicles''' search benefit from its highlighting when you visit a search hit. Here's a screenshot to show the effect.  The current location is in pink; other hits are in cyan:
