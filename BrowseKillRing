This page is about ways to browse the [[kill ring]], choosing a kill to [[yank]].


== Browsing the Kill Ring ==


* ##browse-kill-ring.el## -- a package by ColinWalters, maintained by NickHurley. You can get it here:
** <tt>[[browse-kill-ring.el]]</tt> -- I uploaded ##browse-kill-ring.el## from www.todesschaf.org, I guess this makes it at least semi-official :-) --ClausBrunzema
** Debian: ##apt-get install emacs-goodies-el## (DebianPackage:emacs-goodies-el)
** http://www.todesschaf.org/files/browse-kill-ring.el -- Another link, though I have no idea whether it is "official" in any way.   -- OliverScholz
** It used to be at [http://opensource.cis.ohio-state.edu/~hurley/browse-kill-ring.el], but this link seems dead.

* <tt>[[browse-kill-ring+.el]]</tt> -- Enhancements to ##browse-kill-ring.el##. (Sent to NickHurley for possible inclusion in ##browse-kill-ring.el##.)
** You can toggle the display style (new command and key binding).
** You can browse (or pop) other rings, in addition to the `kill-ring'. For example, the `secondary-selection-ring' (see [[SecondarySelection#secondary-sel.el|secondary-sel.el]]).

* [[Icicles]] -- `C-- C-y' completes against the kill ring. You can clean up the ring selectively, deleting entries on the fly. You can sort completions in various ways. [[progressive completion|Progressive]] completion.

* KillRingSearch -- incremental search of the kill ring

* <tt>[[popup-kill-ring.el]]</tt> -- interactively insert item from kill-ring

* <tt>[[wuxch-browse-kill-ring.el]]</tt> -- key bindings, customization

* Similar to browse-kill-ring -- makes it easy to access and yank text from the kill ring:

       (global-set-key "\C-cy" '(lambda ()
                                 (interactive)
                                 (popup-menu 'yank-menu)))

* Similar function with 
[[Anything]], a candidate selection framework. Start with `M-x anything-show-kill-ring', narrow the list by typing some patterns(multiple patterns are space-delimited string),
select with up/down/pgup/pgdown/C-p/C-n/C-v/M-v, choose with enter to insert an element of `kill-ring'.


== Discussion ==

[new]
I can't praise browse-kill-ring enough -- I don't use it all that much, but when I need it there's no replacing it. -- [[Anonymous]]

[new]
Someone once said "The easiest way to invoke kill-ring browsing is just to use `M-y' without first using `C-y'".  But when I try that (with Emacs 22) I just get "Previous command was not a yank". 

[new]
To get the "M-y immediately pulls up the kill ring" behavior, you need to run M-x browse-kill-ring-default-keybindings.  Or, to put this in .emacs

 (require 'browse-kill-ring)
 (browse-kill-ring-default-keybindings)
