Oddmuse Curl Mode is a fork of a very old revision of OddmuseMode maintained by AlexSchroeder.

Cool features:

* [[VersionControl|VC]] integration
* Preview using [[HtmlRendering|shr]]

The code is maintained on Savannah using Git:

* [http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/oddmuse.git/tree/contrib/oddmuse-curl.el oddmuse-curl.el]
* [http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/oddmuse.git/tree/contrib/vc-oddmuse.el vc-oddmuse.el]

Here's a typical setup:

{{{
;;; Oddmuse

(setq oddmuse-username "AlexSchroeder")
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("/Users/alex/.emacs.d/oddmuse" . oddmuse-mode))
(autoload 'oddmuse-edit "oddmuse-curl"
  "Edit a page on an Oddmuse wiki." t)
(add-to-list 'vc-handled-backends 'oddmuse)
(defun vc-oddmuse-registered (file)
  "Handle files in `oddmuse-directory'."
  (string-match (concat "^" (expand-file-name oddmuse-directory))
		(file-name-directory file)))
}}}

Adding to `vc-handled-backends' and the definition of `vc-oddmuse-registered' would be
part of autoloads, if this file was distributed with Emacs. As it stands, you could
instead ##(require 'vc-oddmuse)##. It's just that I want to keep my Emacs startup speed
down and that's why I don't.

== Important Entry Points ==

`oddmuse-edit' asks you for a wiki and a page name and allows you to edit it.

Once you're editing a wiki page, here are some useful keybindings:

; `C-c C-c' : post the changes you made
; `C-c C-m' : toggle posting minor changes -- often people will make a big change and continue fixing later typos using minor changes
; `C-c C-n' : create a new page with the current date as the default page name (useful for blogging)
; `C-c C-o' : follow ("open") the link under point
; `C-c C-p' : preview the current page
; `C-c C-f' : find a different page to edit
; `C-c C-i' : insert an existing page name (avoiding typos)
; `C-c C-r' : look at recent changes of the wiki you're currently working with
; `C-c C-h' : look at the history of the page you are editing
; `C-x v l' : look at /all/ past changes of the page you are editing
; ##‘C-x v =’## : look at the diff of what you will be posting
; `C-x C-v' : revert your changes
