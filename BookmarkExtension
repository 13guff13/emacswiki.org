You should use an image host which allows full size images, so if you click on the thumbnall a new page is opened with the full size pictures. Or you could link the images to the full images on Flickr.

These screenshots are pretty much useless, because you only see a very vague color outline of things. If a new user comes here they are not very helpful to present what these features actually look like during use.

: Thanks for the links to the full screen pictures. I wish it would be a policy on Emacs Wiki (to provide a link to the original picture), because I've seen ridiculously tiny screenshots on other pages too.
