Everyone has their own dreams, and every emacser  has an own operating system dream!   -- AndyStewart

==We want full-feature browser in Emacs!==
I think every emacser are hoping to run a modern browser in Emacs inside, not text browser like w3m, not xwidget that break emacs' text pure world, 
we hope running WebKit engine browser like any  other modern application, not just text, it can run javascript, it can access any website you want to visit, 
and integrated with Emacs well.
