`image-mode' is a standard library since Emacs 22, enabling (GUI) Emacs frames to render the image in the buffer, when visiting an image file.

The user can toggle between the rendered view and the textual content of the image file.

Image mode is discussed in the manual here: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/File-Conveniences.html.

See also ImageDired, which allows you to view a collection of thumbnails.

This won't help if you use Emacs on a terminal. I've got this that uses asciiview (part of the aview package in debian) to render an images as ascii art:

 (defun asciiview (imagefile)
   ;; use asciiview (part of aatools) to render image file as text to buffer
   (interactive "fChoose image file: ")
   (save-excursion
     (with-current-buffer (pop-to-buffer (format "*asciiview %s*" imagefile))
       (insert
        (car (last (butlast
                (split-string
                 (shell-command-to-string
                  (format
                   "echo q | asciiview -driver stdout -kbddriver stdin %s 2>/dev/null"
                   (shell-quote-argument imagefile)))
                 "^L")))))
       (view-mode))))
