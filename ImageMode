`image-mode' is a standard library since Emacs 22, enabling (GUI) Emacs frames to render the image in the buffer, when visiting an image file.

The user can toggle between the rendered view and the textual content of the image file.

Image mode is discussed in the manual here: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/File-Conveniences.html.

See also ImageDired, which allows you to view a collection of thumbnails.
