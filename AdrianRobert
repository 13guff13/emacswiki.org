BTW, some people wonder why work continues on these ports when the AndrewChoi / YamamotoMitsuharu Carbon-based port behind Aquamacs and Carbon Emacs Package seems further along.  There are three major reasons:

* It also runs on Linux, FreeBSD, and maybe Solaris and Windows, offering anti-aliased text and all of other the benefits of the OS X UI on those platforms, via the [http://gnustep.org GNUstep] free open source implementation.

* It aims for more complete integration with the Aqua UI than the Carbon port, particularly in the areas of customization and font selection.

* It has a codebase half the size of the Carbon port, due to use of a higher level GUI API.

Historically, the Cocoa port came first, deriving from the earlier OpenStep version, then stagnated for a period during which Carbon port came into existence by modifying an independent MacOS 9 port.
