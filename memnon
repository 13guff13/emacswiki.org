Hi!

I am memnon, user of [[ratpoison]] and emacs for (only) nearly a year.
I am still heavily tweaking my setup, and the emacswiki is my first 
ressource and best 
companion for it. So I will try to contribute bits, that are not 
available here (but maybe useful for others), back and correct
outdated stuff.

Well, thats it... 
Have a nice day, have fun! ;)
