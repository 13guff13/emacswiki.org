== How can I prevent WL from splitting large attachments into many messages? ==

Add the following to your ##.wl## file:

{{{
(setq mime-edit-split-message nil)
}}}

== If I add folders to an access group outside of Wanderlust, how do I make Wanderlust pick up those changes? ==

In the folder manager, close the access group, then use ##C-u <RET>## to open it again. Wanderlust will scan the access group for new folders.

== Offline ==

=== How do I force Wanderlust to pre-fetch all messages in a folder for offline access? ==

First:
{{{
(setq wl-summary-incorporate-marks '("N" "U" "!" "A" "F" "$"))
}}}

Now, from the ##Folder## buffer, use the command ##wl-folder-prefetch-current-entity## (bound to ##I##) on any entity that you wish to prefetch all messages of.

== Speed ==

=== When I update, Wanderlust is slow and spends a long time with the message "Updating marks..." ===

If you only use Wanderlust to access a mailbox, you can set
##wl-summary-auto-sync-marks## to ##nil## in your ##.wl## file.

== Unicode ==

Release 2.14 was created before emacs23 was released. As a consequence, there may occur some problems with unicode
support. They can be fixed by using a snapshot from the CVS repository. For a working variant, please see
