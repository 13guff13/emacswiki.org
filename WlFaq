== How can I prevent WL from splitting large attachments into many messages? ==

Add the following to your ##.wl## file:

{{{
(setq mime-edit-split-message nil)
}}}

== If I add folders to an access group outside of Wanderlust, how do I make Wanderlust pick up those changes? ==

In the folder manager, close the access group, then use ##C-u <ENTER>## to open it again. Wanderlust will scan the access group for new folders.

== Speed ==

=== When I update, Wanderlust is slow and spends a long time with the message "Updating marks..." ===

If you only use Wanderlust to access a mailbox, you can set
##wl-summary-auto-sync-marks## to ##nil## in your ##.wl## file.
