== Frequently Asked Questions about Wanderlust ==

=== How can I prevent WL from splitting large attachments into many messages? ===

Add the following to your ##.wl## file:

{{{
(setq mime-edit-split-message nil)
}}}

=== Speed ===

==== When I update, Wanderlust is slow and spends a long time with the message "Updating marks..." ====

If you only use Wanderlust to access a mailbox, you can set
##wl-summary-auto-sync-marks## to ##nil## in your ##.wl## file.
