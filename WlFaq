== How can I prevent WL from splitting large attachments into many messages? ==

Add the following to your ##.wl## file:

{{{
(setq mime-edit-split-message nil)
}}}

== If I add folders to an access group outside of Wanderlust, how do I make Wanderlust pick up those changes? ==

In the folder manager, close the access group, then use ##C-u <RET>## to open it again. Wanderlust will scan the access group for new folders.

== How can I get WL's mail composition mode to do completion from aliases in my ~/.mailrc file? ==

In your .wl:

{{{
;; Use ~/.mailrc
(setq wl-address-init-function 'my-wl-address-init)
(defun my-wl-address-init ()
  (wl-local-address-init)
  (setq wl-address-completion-list
        (append wl-address-completion-list (build-mail-aliases))))
}}}

== Offline ==

=== How do I force Wanderlust to pre-fetch all messages in a folder for offline access? ==

First:
{{{
(setq wl-summary-incorporate-marks '("N" "U" "!" "A" "F" "$"))
}}}

Now, from the ##Folder## buffer, use the command ##wl-folder-prefetch-current-entity## (bound to ##I##) on any entity that you wish to prefetch all messages of.

== Speed ==

=== When I update, Wanderlust is slow and spends a long time with the message "Updating marks..." ===

If you only use Wanderlust to access a mailbox, you can set
##wl-summary-auto-sync-marks## to ##nil## in your ##.wl## file.

== Unicode ==

Release 2.14 was created before emacs23 was released. As a consequence, there may occur some problems with unicode
support. They can be fixed by using a snapshot from the CVS repository. For a working variant, please see 
[http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.mail.wanderlust.general/2768] .

== How can I change which headers wl displays when viewing a message? ==

The headers wl displays when viewing and editing a message are
controlled by two variables: `wl-message-ignored-filed-list' and
`wl-message-visible-field-list'.  Both are lists whose elements are
regular expressions that are used to determine which headers are
displayed and which are not.

If you for instance only want a basic set of headers like From:, To:,
Cc:, Subject: and Date: to be displayed you could set these variables
as followed:

{{{
;; ignore  all fields
(setq wl-message-ignored-field-list '("^.*:"))

;; ..but these five
(setq wl-message-visible-field-list
'("^To:"
  "^Cc:"
  "^From:"
  "^Subject:"
  "^Date:"))
}}}

In addition you can control the order of these headers using the
variable `wl-message-sort-field-list':

{{{
(setq wl-message-sort-field-list
 '("^From:"
   "^Subject:"
   "^Date:"
   "^To:"
   "^Cc:"))
}}}
