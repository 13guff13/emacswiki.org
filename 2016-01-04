# HTTPS. [https://www.eff.org/encrypt-the-web Encrypting the Web] is important. We can do it. https://www.emacswiki.org/ works thanks to [https://letsencrypt.org/ Let's Encrypt], but for the moment all it's links point back to http://www.emacswiki.org/. I want to work on that. Right now, the default CSS is served via HTTP, for example.

# A new CSS. BrianBurns has been working on a new theme.

Just wanted to add a note that the logo is just a placeholder at the moment - other designs or ideas are welcome! (the leaves are meant represent an E and W). 

There are still bits that need tweaking here and there - at some point we could open this up on the Devlist and Reddit to get more suggestions.
