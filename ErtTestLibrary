'''[http://github.com/ohler/ert/blob/master/ert.el ert.el]''' is an '''E'''macs Lisp library for '''r'''egression/unit '''t'''esting.

If you want to use ##ert.el##, there are examples at the end of the file that are used for testing ##ert.el## itself.

You can also find examples in [NxhtmlMode nXhtml-mode], which uses a slightly modified version for tests.
