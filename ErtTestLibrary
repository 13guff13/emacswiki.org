This page is about [http://github.com/ohler/ert/blob/master/ert.el ert.el] - an Emacs lisp library for regression/unit testing.

If you want to use ert.el there are examples at the end of the file that are used for testing ert.el.

You can also find examples in [NxhtmlMode nXhtml] which uses a slightly modified version for tests.
