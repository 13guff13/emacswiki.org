'''[http://github.com/ohler/ert/blob/master/ert.el ert.el]''' is an '''E'''macs Lisp library for '''r'''egression/unit '''t'''esting.

If you want to use ##ert.el##, there are examples at the end of the file that are used for testing ##ert.el## itself.

== Extensions ==

LennartBorgman has written ##ert2.el## ("additions to ##ert.el##"), which contains functions for emulating the command loop and setting up a file/buffer to play with. It is distributed with [[NxhtmlMode|nXhtml-mode]], in the ##tests## subfolder.

== Discussion ==

Whenever I ##(require 'ert)##, it runs a number of tests on itself. Is there a way to disable them to improve startup time? -- VegardOye
