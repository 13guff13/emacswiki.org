Harley Gorrell has written a [http://www.mahalito.net/~harley/elisp/crontab-mode.el crontab-mode.el].

From the commentary:

* I want to keep my crontabs under rcs to keep a history of the file.  Editing them with 'crontab -e' is rather cumbersome.  My method is to keep the crontab as a file, under rcs, and check in the changes with 'C-c C-c' after editing.
* The remote systems are expected to share a filesystem. If they dont, modify crontab-shell or crontab-apply to suit your needs.
