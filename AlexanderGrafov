Alexander I.Grafov. My other names in different communities: Axel, Siberianlaika, Red Silence.
My native language is Russian, I speak English (yet not so good as I wish) and know Esperanto a bit.

== I use Emacs ==

I use GNU/Emacs approximately since 2000. I use GNU/Linux (Gentoo, Debian, Ubuntu) with I3 WM and rxvt terminal. I used many programming  languages and like many of them but mostly love Lisp and Forth  (yes they so different but they both are real state of the computer art).

See [https://github.com/grafov] for my programming works.

== Keymacs keyboard layout ==

[https://github.com/keyboard-ergonomics/keymacs] It is experiment how to make ergonomic layout for Emacs on default keyboard. Instead of change keybindings in Emacs I reprogrammed a keyboard layout.

== Playground mode for Go language ==

[https://github.com/grafov/go-playground] This mode offers functionality similar to playg.golang.org but inside Emacs.

== Contacts ==
