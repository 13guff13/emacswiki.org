Alexander I.Grafov. My other names in different communities: Axel, Siberianlaika, Red Silence.
My native language is Russian, I speak English (yet not so good as I wish) and know Esperanto a bit.

== I use Emacs ==

I use GNU/Emacs approximately since 2000. Behind Emacs I use GNU/Linux (Gentoo, Debian, Ubuntu) with Xmonad as WM. In programming I love Lisp and Python (include Monty Python series :) though mostly often programming in PHP.

== Init Files ==

[https://github.com/siberianlaika/aeis AEIS] — not quit init file but a structure of init-system used by me.

== My Elisp works ==

Though I am not a newbie Emacs user, but I started programming Elisp only last 2 years and continue to learn Emacs language. My current projects are:

* [http://drupal.org/project/emacs Emacs IDE for Drupal CMS]
* [https://github.com/siberianlaika/aeis Another Emacs Initialization Set]
