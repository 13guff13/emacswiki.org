An [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avl_tree AVL tree] is a form of self-balancing binary tree. Other types of self-balancing binary tree which serve a similar purpose are RedBlackTrees and SplayTrees. Recent versions of Emacs include an implementation of AVL trees (previously, it was part of the separate Elib package). To use them in your code, you need to

  (require 'avl)

TobyCubitt has written a drop-in replacement for the version included in Emacs, which adds a number of new functions, and adds new optional arguments to some existing functions. These enhancements are necessary for efficient implementations of certain algorithms involving AVL trees (which is, after all, the whole point!). The latest version of that package (0.2, released October 2010) can be obtained from:

* AVL tree package download: http://www.dr-qubit.org/download.php?file=predictive/avl-tree.el
* AVL tree git repository: <code>http://www.dr-qubit.org/git/predictive.git</code>
* Web-site: http://www.dr-qubit.org/emacs.php#structures

The development version is hosted in the same git repository as PredictiveMode. Note that the git repository URL is a git repository, *not* a web-site. You cannot view it in a web browser. To grab the latest development version, clone the repository using something like:

  git clone http://www.dr-qubit.org/git/predictive.git predictive 


If you want to use this replacement version, but don't want to overwrite the version included in Emacs, then make sure that the replacement version is saved to a path that appears earlier in your Emacs <code>load-path</code> than the directory containing the original version (usually something like <code>/usr/share/emacs/lisp/emacs-lisp/</code> on *nix systems).

Please send bug reports and suggestions <em>about this replacement version</em> to [mailto:toby-predictive@dr-qubit.org toby-predictive@dr-qubit.org] (you can post them here as well if you like, of course). I don't check this page regularly, so anything not emailed to me is likely to languish here unnoticed for some time. --TobyCubitt

Could this replacement be contributed to Emacs? --JoakimVerona

That's the intention. I'm getting there...slowly! -- TobyCubitt

I've now submitted a patch series implementing my changes for inclusion in Emacs. --TobyCubitt
