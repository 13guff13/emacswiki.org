AsmMode is a simple AssemblyProgramming mode that is based on TextMode.  It is superseded by GasMode and by assembly-specific modes.

As the code's comments say, "Code is indented to the first tab stop level."  As with most Emacs [[MajorMode]]s, setting your tab width won't influence it.  To change your tab stops, see TabStopList.  See also IndentationBasics.
