This page is about library '''<tt>[[pp+.el]]</tt>''' which extends standard library ##pp.el## to provide enhanced pretty-printing.


== Features ==

* You can optionally show the result of pretty-printing in a
   [[tooltip]] at point, by customizing option '''`pp-max-tooltip-size''''.

* Pretty-printing respects options
   '''`pp-eval-expression-print-length'''' and
   '''`pp-eval-expression-print-level'''', which act like `print-length'
   and `print-level', but only for pretty-printing.

* The buffer displaying the pretty-printed result is in
   EmacsLisp mode (and is fontified accordingly), but without
   having run `emacs-lisp-mode-hook' or `change-major-mode-hook'.

* Command '''`pp-eval-expression'''' is enhanced in these ways:

** Option `eval-expression-debug-on-error' is respected.

** With a [[prefix argument]], the value is inserted into the current
      buffer at point.  With a negative prefix arg, if the value
      is a string, then it is inserted without being enclosed in
      double-quotes (`##"##').

** Completion is available, using keymap
      '''`pp-read-expression-map'''', which is like `read-expression-map' but with some EmacsLisp key bindings:

*** `C-M-q' to indent a sexp
*** `C-M-x' to eval a sexp
*** `TAB' to Lisp-indent
*** `M-TAB' to complete a Lisp symbol

Suggested keybinding:

     (global-set-key [remap eval-expression] 'pp-eval-expression)
