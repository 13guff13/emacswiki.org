There are some PGP plugins for outlook which may be able to decrypt the message you send them with PGP/MIME, but encrypted attachments will show up in outlook with a random name and the file extension .dat.

When searching the interweb for help I found lots of rants and just a few hints[http://article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.gnus.general/35727/][http://article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.gnus.general/56323], thus I will describe a workaround.

= Configuration =
First of all, install [[MailCrypt]].

Then add this elisp code to your ~/.gnus.el.

   ;; "put Content-Type: text/plain at top of empty parts" (gnus manual)
   (setq mml-insert-mime-headers-always t)

   ;; encrypt always with my key
   (setq mc-encrypt-for-me t)

   ;; don't sign the message
   (setq mc-pgp-always-sign 'never)

= Workflow =
* Write the message
* Encrypt it using M-x mc-encrypt
* PGP ASCII-armor your attachments (outside Emacs you would use ''gpg -a'')
* Use M-x mml-attach-file to add those PGP ASCII-armored attachments (''after'' you have already encrypted your mail with mc-encrypt)
