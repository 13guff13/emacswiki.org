Very nice package!!
I use bm.el much more frequently than standard bookmark.el. -- [[rubikitch]]

Yes, very nice. I use it differently from ##bookmark.el##, not more or less. In <tt>[[setup-keys.el]]</tt>, I bind:
* `bm-toggle' to `S-f3'
* `bm-next' to `C-f3'
* `bm-previous' to `M-f3'

I have written an extension for this that adds a listing of all bookmarks in all buffers. See here: [[bm-ext.el]]  -- [[DanMcKinley]

If you want to be able to toggle bookmarks by clicking in the fringe, this works for me:
<pre>
(global-set-key (kbd "<left-fringe> <mouse-1>") #'(lambda(event)
                                                    (interactive "e")
                                                    (save-excursion
                                                      (mouse-set-point event)
                                                      (bm-toggle))))
</pre>
