Very nice package!!
I use bm.el much more frequently than standard bookmark.el. -- [[rubikitch]]

Yes, very nice. I use it differently from ##bookmark.el##, not more or less. In <tt>[[setup-keys.el]]</tt>, I bind:
* `bm-toggle' to `S-f3'
* `bm-next' to `C-f3'
* `bm-previous' to `M-f3'

I have written an extension for this that adds a listing of all bookmarks in all buffers. See here: [[bm-ext.el]]  -- [[DanMcKinley]

ATM, bm.el contains `bm-show-all' and claims to since version 1.34 -- there is even acknowledgement of DanMcKinley's work from [[bm-ext.el]].  AFAICT, [[bm-ext.el]] is no longer necessary from a functional perspective. -- Anonymous

If you want to be able to toggle bookmarks by clicking in the fringe, this works for me:
<pre>
(global-set-key (kbd "<left-fringe> <mouse-1>") #'(lambda(event)
                                                    (interactive "e")
                                                    (save-excursion
                                                      (mouse-set-point event)
                                                      (bm-toggle))))
</pre>

== Use with Anything ==
'''[[Anything]]''' is a candidate selection framework.

Start with M-x anything-bm-list, narrow the list by typing some patterns(multiple patterns are space-delimited string),
select with up/down/pgup/pgdown/C-p/C-n/C-v/M-v, choose with enter,
With C-z contents of selected bookmark is displayed without quitting anything session.
