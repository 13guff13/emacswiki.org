Apparently, our Indian spammer friends (IP numbers 163.47.140.*, 180.151.1.*, ...) discovered that Emacs Wiki was editable again. I feel like locking the wiki down again for a bit as I'm about to go to sleep and I'm sure Drew has better things to do than despam the wiki every ten minutes. We're not in a rush. :)

Also: [https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=browse;diff=1;id=canon_printer_technical phone number spam without phone numbers]? I really don't understand this business model. These spammers are ripping off their customers _and_ vandalizing the wiki.
