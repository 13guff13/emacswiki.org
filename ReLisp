Rubyfied EmacsLisp

The purpose of Relisp is to:
* call Ruby from Emacs
* call Elisp from Ruby
* manipulate Emacs without using Elisp to some extent (Ruby wrappers around some Elisp functions and objects)

Gem is available at http://rubyforge.org/projects/relisp/.  Introduction and some examples are at [http://ohspite.net/2009/01/30/relisp-rubyfied-emacs-lisp/ ohspite.net]
