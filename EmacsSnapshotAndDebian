There are good Debian and Ubuntu packages that provide emacs versions newer than the official packages. One can also install from source for maximum freshness.

== Debian packages ==

The Debian packages [[http://emacs.naquadah.org/|emacs-snapshot*]] are no longer maintained as of 11 Jan 2014. Alternatives include:

* [[https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=emacs24&searchon=names&suite=all&section=all&sourceid=mozilla-search|packages=emacs-24*]]: gets latest released emacs-24 version.

== Ubuntu packages ==

Alternatives include:

* Damien Cassou's [[https://launchpad.net/~cassou/+archive/emacs|bimonthly-build Ubuntu PPA]]
* Robert Parks' [[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-elisp/+archive/ppa/|daily-build Ubuntu PPA]]

== Installing from source on Debian and similar ==

To install a bleeding-edge version of Emacs direct from Bazaar, or build it from source for any other reason, and still integrate with Debian, so your version of Emacs can act as a dependency, one can use [[https://github.com/rrthomas/src-emacs-on-debian|this handy script and Debian package]] by Michael Olson. 

Alternatively, do it yourself. First, use git to get the sources:

    git clone --depth 1 git://git.sv.gnu.org/emacs.git

=== Required Packages ===

The following packages are available through apt-get/aptitude and might need to be installed. Check the output from the configure stage described below.

* autoconf
* automake
* libtool
* texinfo -- is not essential but if you want the manuals you need it
* build-essential
* xorg-dev
* libgtk2.0-dev
* libjpeg-dev
* libncurses5-dev
* libgif-dev
* libtiff-dev
* libm17n-dev
* libpng12-dev
* librsvg2-dev
* libotf-dev

Copy and paste this for easy apt-get lines:

{{{
autoconf automake libtool texinfo build-essential xorg-dev libgtk2.0-dev libjpeg-dev libncurses5-dev libgif-dev libtiff-dev libm17n-dev libpng12-dev librsvg2-dev libotf-dev
}}}

=== Building from the source ===

In order to build after installing required dependencies:

{{{
cd emacs
./autogen.sh
./configure
make bootstrap
sudo make install
}}}

A good alternative is to not do a root install:

{{{
mkdir ~/emacs-20131123 # for example
cd emacs
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=/home/me/emacs-20131123 # for example
make bootstrap
make install
}}}

Then use ##~/emacs-20131123/bin/emacs## to start it.


== Optional multi character library ==

For non-latin scripts you might want to add:

{{{
libm17n-dev
}}}

as a library and:

{{{
--with--m17n-flt
}}}

as a configure option.


== Keeping up to date ==

You can use git pull to keep pulling. Emacs is often released against tags so you can pull those too:

{{{
git checkout -t tag-name
}}}

To rebuild it's best to:

{{{
git clean -dxf  ## cleans up old files
./autogen.sh
./configure
make bootstrap
sudo make install
}}}

or use the alternative method to have a prefixed emacs.
