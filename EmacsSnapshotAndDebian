There are good packages for Emacs Snapshot (a daily snapshot of the latest HEAD in the source repository) and also for Emacs 24 releases.

== APT Packages ==
The APT repository at http://emacs.naquadah.org/ has precompiled emacs-snapshot packages available for a few different architectures and Debian releases.

It is rebuilt daily (normally) and can be installed with a package manager (like aptitude).

You //may// need some of the dependencies listed below. 

=== Problems ===
I was having problems with installing emacs-snapshot on Debian Wheezy due to unsatisfiable libmagick-dependencies. The problem was solved by apt-pinning; basically taking two missing libraries from Debian unstable repositories. John H. Robinson has written [http://jaqque.sbih.org/kplug/apt-pinning.html noob-friendly guide to apt-pinning].

== Ubuntu PPA ==
There is also an [[https://launchpad.net/~cassou/+archive/emacs|Ubuntu PPA]].

== Installing from source on Debian and Debian alikes ==
You can use git to get the source:

    git clone --depth 1 git://git.sv.gnu.org/emacs.git

=== Required Packages ===

The following packages are available through apt-get/aptitude and might need to be installed. Check the output from the configure stage described below.

* autoconf
* automake
* libtool
* texinfo -- is not essential but if you want the manuals you need it
* build-essential
* xorg-dev
* libgtk2.0-dev
* libjpeg-dev
* libgif-dev
* libtiff-dev
* libm17n-dev
* libpng12-dev
* librsvg2-dev
* libotf-dev

=== Building from the source ===
In order to build after installing required dependencies:

{{{
cd emacs
./autogen.sh
./configure
make bootstrap
sudo make install
}}}

A good alternative is to not do a root install:

{{{
mkdir ~/emacs-20131123 # for example
cd emacs
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=/home/me/emacs-20131123 # for example
make bootstrap
make install
}}}

Then use {{{~/emacs-20131123/bin/emacs}}} to start it.
