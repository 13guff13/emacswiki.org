Following are the steps and packages required to compile Emacs from git on Debian.


== Getting Latest Source==

I also feel this page might be a misnomer since its not a "snapshot" which is a term normally reserved for a repository which is maintained as "stable" for people to use.  It's about building directly from the head of the git repository.

    git clone --depth 1 git://git.sv.gnu.org/emacs.git

Both commands will create a directory named emacs and put the source in it.

== Required Packages ==

To install base libraries:

sudo aptitude install build-essential

The following packages are available through apt-get/aptitude and might need to be installed. Check the output from the configure stage described below.

* autoconf
* automake
* libtool
* texinfo -- is not essential but if you want the manuals you need it
* build-essential
* xorg-dev
* libgtk2.0-dev
* libjpg-dev
* libgif-dev
* libtiff-dev
* libm17n-dev
* libpng12-dev
* librsvg2-dev
* libotf-dev

== Build ==

In order to build after installing required dependencies.

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make bootstrap
    sudo make install

== Update ==

To update the emacs code from the repositories perform the following command line commands:

CVS : cvs upd

GIT : git pull

and then do a make and install as described in the Build section above.

== Alternatives ==

There is also a precompiled emacs-snapshot package available at http://emacs.naquadah.org/.
It is rebuilt regularly and can be installed with a package mananger (like aptitude).

I was having problems with installing emacs-snapshot on Debian Wheezy due to unsatisfiable libmagick-dependencies. The problem was solved by apt-pinning; basically taking two missing libraries from Debian unstable repositories. John H. Robinson has written [http://jaqque.sbih.org/kplug/apt-pinning.html noob-friendly guide to apt-pinning].
