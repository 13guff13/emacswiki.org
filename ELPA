ELPA is the *Emacs Lisp Package Archive*, by TomTromey.

http://tromey.com/elpa/

"Our goal is to make it simple to install, use, and upgrade Emacs Lisp packages. We supply ##package.el##, a simple package manager for Emacs, and a repository of pre-packed Emacs Lisp code."

##package.el## (from ELPA) will be added to vanilla GnuEmacs, version 24.  As of 2010-06-18, ##package.el## has been merged with the development version of Emacs, and an ELPA repository has been set up at http://elpa.gnu.org/.

The Emacs version of ##package.el## will support multiple repositories.  You can use the global ELPA plus the Emacs GNU repository like this:

  (setq package-archives '(("ELPA" . "http://tromey.com/elpa/") 
                           ("gnu" . "http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")))
