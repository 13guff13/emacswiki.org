ELPA is the *Emacs Lisp Package Archive*, by TomTromey.

http://tromey.com/elpa/

"Our goal is to make it simple to install, use, and upgrade Emacs Lisp packages. We supply ##package.el##, a simple package manager for Emacs, and a repository of pre-packed Emacs Lisp code."

As of 18-Jun-2010, ##package.el## (from ELPA) has been merged with Emacs and an ELPA repository set up at http://elpa.gnu.org/

The Emacs version of package.el will support multiple repositories.
