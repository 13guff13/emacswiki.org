Significant overlap with CategoryProgrammerUtils? Maybe move some items from there to here?

Yes, CategoryProgrammerUtils already has a long section, but (again) I was more comfortable creating new content than disturbing someone else's work.

Yeah, but on the other hand we get a lot of criticism that the wiki needs better organization, so this is my gentle prodding in the right direction. ;)
