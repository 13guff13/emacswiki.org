Significant overlap with CategoryProgrammerUtils? Maybe move some items from there to here?

Yes, CategoryProgrammerUtils already has a long section, but (again) I was more comfortable creating new content than disturbing someone else's work.

Yeah, but on the other hand we get a lot of criticism that the wiki needs better organization, so this is my gentle prodding in the right direction. ;)

Forget that noise -- if it isn't a "work-in-progress" then it isn't a Wiki.

I'll take a crack at this one after I get your assessment on the changes made to CategoryCode/CategoryExtensions.

(FWIW, I would be more in favor of a CategoryProject than a CategoryExtensions. It is more well defined etc.)

But my suggestion --- for all of this stuff that you are doing, is to do the following ''instead'':

* ''Propose'' a change (this is reorg of the wiki, after all, not just tweaking or adding some ordinary page) for ''discussion''.

* Try first reorganizing ''within'' existing categories.  Try adding a subheading on an existing category page, which introduces a list of links having to do with projects (or whatever).  We can thus ''organize'' that way, before any discussion or attempt to '''''RE'''''organize.

* After discussion and consensus, we can move toward whatever is decided.

If attempts to organize within the existing category structure present significant obstacles and indicate that a real '''''RE'''organization would be in order, '''''then''''' we can discuss what that reorg should be.  '''''Then''''', after agreement, we can move to implement the reorg.
