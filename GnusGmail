[[es:Gnus_y_Gmail]]

*Note that this page is not GMail-specific.*

[[Gnus]] can connect to the gmail server in two ways: by POP3, or by IMAP. Each protocol behaves in a different way, so you can select the one which better suits your needs. Furthermore, as a third solution you can download your mail with an external program like fetchmail and let Gnus handle it locally.

This page describes how to configure Gnus to read and send mails from your gmail account, and should also explain how to do in Gnus what you're able to do through the web interface.

----

==Configuration==
===Accessing Gmail via Imap===

Firstly, don't forget to enable IMAP in your Gmail account (settings->forwarding POP/IMAP). Settings to tell gnus to use Gmail's IMAP as a (secondary) select method are as follows:
<pre>
(add-to-list 'gnus-secondary-select-methods '(nnimap "gmail"
                                  (nnimap-address "imap.gmail.com")
                                  (nnimap-server-port 993)
                                  (nnimap-stream ssl)))
</pre>
with a line like the following one in your ~/.authinfo
<pre>
machine imap.gmail.com login username@gmail.com password secret port 993
</pre>

Also, if you want to take advantage of using gmail's SMTP server (so gmail keeps track of your sent mail), you can use the following settings:

<pre>
(setq message-send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it
      smtpmail-starttls-credentials '(("smtp.gmail.com" 587 nil nil))
      smtpmail-auth-credentials '(("smtp.gmail.com" 587 "username@gmail.com" nil))
      smtpmail-default-smtp-server "smtp.gmail.com"
      smtpmail-smtp-server "smtp.gmail.com"
      smtpmail-smtp-service 587
      smtpmail-local-domain "yourcompany.com")
</pre>

NOTE: You will need starttls, which is used to set up the SSL encrypted connection to the GMail server. This is contained in the "gnutls-bin" package on earlier versions of debian and ubuntu. With later versions (at least Ubuntu 9.10), starttls is in its own package, and the "gnutls-bin" package is not needed. If you don't have starttls installed, you'll get a (rather generic) "smtpmail-send-it: Sending failed; SMTP protocol error" error message.

NOTE: (Pointed out by ChristofHarper) You can also store your password in the smtpmail-auth-credentials line, but this means that you've got to be more careful when sharing config files with other people.

NOTE: It seems that the above settings (which are what Google recommends) don't work for some people. Another possibility is to use port 25, and then use ~/.authinfo to convert it back to 587, thus circumventing some code which was getting confused about SMTP through a non-25 port. To do this, replace all occurrences of 587 with 25 in the above snippet, and add the following line to your ~/.authinfo (see [[GnusAuthinfo]] and [[GnusEncryptedAuthInfo]]):

<pre>
machine smtp.gmail.com login username@gmail.com password secret port 587
</pre>

If you don't wish to store your password there, just omit the "password secret" altogether and you'll be prompted when you send an email.

====Accessing the [Gmail] folders====

All Gmail system labels have a prefix [Gmail], it matches the default value of gnus-ignored-newsgroups, so
we could set it to "^to\\.\\|^[0-9.        ]+\\( \\|$\\)\\|^[\"]\"[#'()]" to work around.

===Accessing Gmail via POP===

"Retrieving mail with POP3 is supported over SSL/TLS and with <nowiki>StartTLS</nowiki>." (from GNUS-NEWS)

Put the following in your /gnus-init-file/ is sufficient.
<pre>
(setq mail-sources
      '((pop :server "pop.gmail.com"
             :port 995
             :user "Leo@gmail.com"
             :password "wrongpw"
             :stream ssl)))
</pre>

I have tested this with No Gnus 0.6 (2006-10-19) and XftGnuEmacs (2006-10-04).

[new]
According to
http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=13287
the user name must include @gmail.com  -- AdrianAichner

There is bleeding edge support for sending/getting email through Gmail using only Gnus (and not the webmail interface.) I've verified that this works (rather well in fact.)

# Configure your Gmail account for POP support. This is under Settings in the gmail web interface.

# Use CVS Emacs and CVS Gnus. It won't work any other way. 

# Replace your installation's "pop3.el" and "pop3.elc" with those linked to from this page: http://www.pvv.ntnu.no/~terjeros/wiki/GnusGmail

# Configure as on the linked page. 

-- NOTE: you also need ssl.el, which doesn't seem to come with the current GNU CVS. I found it with a quick google search.

-- I still can seem to get any messages from the server.  I've solved the problems with connection and missing load files, but now it will connect and not report any of the messages.  Any hints?

===Accessing Gmail via an external mail retriever===

Note that you can also get your mail from Gmail using fetchmail if that's installed on your home system. The following .fetchmailrc works for me:

 poll pop.gmail.com with proto POP3 and options no dns
 user 'USERNAME@gmail.com' there with password 'PASSWORD' is 'LOCALUSERNAME' here options ssl

You can then set up a cron job to run fetchmail every few minutes:

 */3 * * * * fetchmail -s >/dev/null 2>&1

-- ALTERNATE: Instead of using cron, you could always add "set daemon 300" (without the quotes) to your .fetchmailrc to use its built-in daemonic capabilities. The "300" tells it to run every 300 seconds (five minutes). Change this number to suit your tastes.

and let gnus read your mail from wherever the usual location is on your system.

Another possibility: if you set up a Gmail filter by entering "in:inbox" in the "Has the words" field (you will get an error message but ignore it) you can have Gmail forward all your mail from your inbox (leaving spam behind) to some location where you can access it without changing your emacs or gnus installation.

Not even the above is necessary (as of 2006-12-02), gmail has now an option for forwarding the whole inbox to another address. [[dida]]

===Sending mail through Gmail's SMTP server===
See the section with the IMAP configuration for the required settings to configure SMTP.

====Storing sent mail in the server====
By default, the mail you send from Gnus is not copied to the Gmail server, so if you open the folder "Sent mail", you won't see it. You will only see mail sent from the web interface.

TODO: how to store sent mail in the server?  (See below.)

A workaround can be CCing yourself whenever you send a mail. With this approach you'll get a copy which is reflected on the server as well. Moreover, you'll be the sender of these copies which makes it easy to define a view including only these messages. To use this solution, write this into your .gnus.el file:
<pre>
(setq gnus-posting-styles
      '((".*"
	 ("CC" "username@gmail.com")
         (address "username@gmail.com"))))
</pre>

Actually, the problem seems to be solved *if* you send mail via gmail's smtp server - at their "Recommended IMAP client settings" they say:

"Do NOT save sent messages on the server. If your client is sending mail through Gmail's SMTP server, your sent messages will be automatically copied to the [Gmail]/Sent Mail folder."




==Usage==
===Archiving mails===
What is the equivalent Gnus command to the „Archive“ button? (Remove from „Inbox“ and stay in „All mail“)

[new:IainDalton:2008-09-07 04:28 UTC]
Remove the "Inbox" tag by deleting from the "INBOX" folder with ##B DEL##.

===Deleting mails===
How can you delete a mail in Gnus so that it disappears from your Inbox in gmail and goes to Trash?

[new]
##B m## does ##gnus-summary-move-article##.  Invoke it, then type "[Gmail]/Trash".  In Gmail terms, this will remove the "Inbox" label and apply the "Trash" label.  Messages in the trash don't show up in other folders, even though they may have other labels.

To really delete, type ##B DEL## (##gnus-summary-delete-article##), but beware: you'll have to delete it from the Trash or Spam folder for it to really delete it.  Otherwise, it will only remove the label from the message.  I suggest writing a script (probably relying on Message-ID) to find the same message in the trash and delete /that/ copy.

[new:IainDalton:2008-09-21 21:10 UTC]
Moving an email to the trash will fail to remove the Inbox label[http://groups.google.com/group/Gmail-Help-POP-and-IMAP-en/browse_thread/thread/bdb862726b66d492/5e4711a3dde1aead#msg_97d44d726079359c].  The solution is to make Gnus locate the message in [Gmail]/All Mail with the same Message-ID as the one in INBOX.  Delete the one in the Inbox and move the one in All Mail to the trash.  Crocky, but the only solution unless Gmail fixes this on their end.  Anyone who has the skill to write this script is welcome to do it.

===Catching up===
If you are seeing some mails in Gnus, and then you delete them in Gmail's web interface, how can make them also disappear from the Gnus view?

[new:IainDalton:2008-09-07 05:28 UTC]
##g## does ##gnus-group-get-new-news## in group mode.  This doesn't seem to work completely correctly: it may report incorrect numbers of unread messages in each group after an update.
[new:DanielClemente:dom sep  7 16:52:11 CEST 2008]
Only ##g## (or ##M-g##) didn't work with the normal configuration. I have seen that Gmail starts working perfectly in Gnus after you disable Gnus Agent, with (setq gnus-agent nil). It seems that gnus-agent and nnimap don't play well together.

[new:IainDalton:2008-09-08 03:42 UTC]
A less drastic solution is to only disable gnus-agent for Gmail.  Go to the server buffer with ##^## and disable the agent for Gmail with ##J r##.

===Conversations view===
How can you see in a single thread both the received message and the sent messages to a person? (As in Gmail's web interface).

[new]
Create a nnvirtual group that contains both "nnimap+imap.gmail.com:INBOX" and "nnimap+imap.gmail.com:[Gmail]/Sent Mail", and you can have conversational view in that group.

===*Article* extracts/previews in *Summary*===
Is it possible to show the first non-reply line of the article within `gnus-summary-line-format', in order to get a "preview"?


===Tags===
How can you assign and remove tags from messages?

[new:IainDalton:2008-09-07 05:28 UTC]
##B c## and ##B DEL##, respectively.

===Empty spam folder===
How can you access your spam folder and review and really delete all messages? (Not move them to Trash!)

[new:IainDalton:2008-09-07 05:28 UTC]
##B DEL##

[new:DanielClemente:dom sep  7 17:16:30 CEST 2008]
How can you *see* the spam folder in the first place? Since I don't see it in the „Gnus browse server“ buffer (accesible from key ^). It's the only folder missing.

[new:IainDalton:2008-09-08 03:16 UTC]
See the configuration section.

===Drafts===
How can you stop composition of an e-mail and store it in Gmail's draft folder? How can you recover it again? 

[new]
In the same way as you can for any other gnus backend (composition is separate from the sending method, mostly): save the mail via C-x C-s and then exit it with C-c C-k. When you look in your nndraft:drafts folder, you'll see it there. To edit, hit e on the mail.

[new:DanielClemente:dom sep  7 17:16:30 CEST 2008]
nndraft is fast, but sometimes it may be convenient to store the draft in the remote folder (for mobility between computers). Any simple solution for that?

[new:IainDalton:2008-09-08 03:16 UTC]
Not as of [http://www.mail-archive.com/info-gnus-english@gnu.org/msg01888.html two years ago, according to Lars], or [http://www.mail-archive.com/info-gnus-english@gnu.org/msg05486.html a few months ago either].

===E-mail search===
How can you search a text string through all your e-mails?

This works only for IMAP. 

From [http://www.lshift.net/blog/2005/07/21/searching-imap-in-gnus Searching IMAP in Gnus].
Add the following line to your .emacs:
<pre>
require 'nnir
</pre>

Then add the following line to the secondary-method in .gnus.el 
<pre>
(nnir-search-engine imap)
</pre>

It should look like this:
<pre>
(add-to-list 'gnus-secondary-select-methods '(nnimap "gmail"
				 (nnimap-stream ssl)
 				 (nnimap-address "imap.gmail.com")
 				 (nnimap-server-port 993)
 				 (nnir-search-engine imap)))
</pre>

Restart Gnus. With ##G G## in the *Groups* buffer, you search for mails in the current group. Note that this not work in virtual groups. If you want to search on all your mails, you should add the folder 'All Mail'.

===Contact autocompletion===
When you compose a message in Gmail, you type the first letters, and a list open ups with the contacts whose name matches what you wrote. How can you manage your contacts and do autocompletion in Gnus?

[new]
Using BBDB (see [[CategoryBbdb]]) you can manage your contacts, and have their names autocompleted when composing new messages.

[new]
But Gmail tracks information automatically about all e-mails ever seen, whereas in BBDB you must add each manually. Which [[BbdbConfiguration]] must be applied to act more Big-Brother-alike, like Gmail?

[new]
You can put the following in your .gnus or init.el or whatever:
<pre>
(setq bbdb/news-auto-create-p t)
</pre>

===Reply-to with the same address as it was sent to===
You can emulate this Gmail feature with the variable `gnus-posting-styles', which also allows you to set a whole bunch of other variables based on the email you reply to or the group you're in. A very simple example, for just two addresses, would be:

    (setq gnus-posting-styles
      '(((header "to" "myname@gmail.com")
         (address "myname@gmail.com"))
	((header "to" "blah@blah.com")
         (address "blah@blah.com"))
	((header "cc" "myname@gmail.com")
         (address "myname@gmail.com"))
	((header "cc" "blah@blah.com")
         (address "blah@blah.com"))))

See the info node on that variable, you could easily automatically add this from a list.

===Chat===
Gmail provides a chat interface which uses the XMPP (Jabber) protocol; therefore you can use Emacs Jabber (see [[JabberEl]] or [[BitlBee]]) to chat with your contacts and with anyone who has a Jabber account.
