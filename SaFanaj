My name is Marco Bardelli. I use Emacs. --- SaFanaj

I haven't any Home on the Web.

At now i'm interesting in [http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org Gstreamer]. 

I'm planning to make a gstreamer-el library 
to build pipeline from emacs.

Maybe integrate it with [[EMMS]].

A bit of cool stuff ...
<code>
(defcustom minimal-height-for-window 4 "...")
(defun minimize-window ()
       (enlarge-window (- minimal-height-for-window (window-height))))
(defun other-window-minimizing ()
       (interactive) (minimize-window)(other-window 1))
(global-set-key [?\C->] 'other-window)
(global-set-key [?\C-<] 'other-window-minimizing)
<code>

Good Life ...
