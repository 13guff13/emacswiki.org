<code>C-h p</code> (or <code>M-x finder-by-keyword</code>) gives you a <code>finder-mode</code> buffer with lisp libraries shown under keyword categories, so you can look at say all the "games" related things.  Read more in Manual:finder-by-keyword.

The libraries listed are only those which come with Emacs, not "site-lisp" or personal extras.  Advanced users can try <code>finder-compile-keywords</code> to make a new <code>finder-inf.el</code> with everything in your LoadPath.

Selecting a library shows its commentary with FinderCommentary (which can also be used directly too, and on anything in your LoadPath).
