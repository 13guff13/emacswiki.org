== About SmartDnD ==

This package provides smart drag-n-drop feature.
For example, when you drop a jpg file to the buffer visiting an html file,
a pre-configured string: ##<img src="...## will be inserted.
For more details, examine the elisp file.

It comes from [[mac-drag-n-drop.el]], but it's no longer mac-only.
The code is tested on the below emacsen.

* Emacs 22.3 (CarbonEmacsPackage) on Mac OS X 10.4
* Emacs 22.0.50 on !CentOS 4.1 / GNOME
* 

Why doesn't this package automatically call iimage-mode?
