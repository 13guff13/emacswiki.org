GnusMairix

== About Mairix ==

Though I use Gnus, I also like tools which do one thing and one thing
only. Mairix is a tool for indexing and searching words in locally
stored mail. It was written by Richard Curnow and is licensed under
the [[GPL]]. For more information visit

http://www.rpcurnow.force9.co.uk/mairix/index.html

Though mairix might not be as flexible as other search tools like
swish++ or namazu (see also: IndexMail), it has the prime advantage
of being incredibly fast. From my experience, it can easily search
through headers and message bodies of thousands and thousands of mails
in well under a second. Building the database necessary for searching
might take a minute or two, but only has to be done once
fully. Afterwards, the updates are done incrementally and therefore
are really fast, too. Additionally, Mairix is very easy to set up.

For maximum speed though, Mairix should be used with mails stored in
Maildir or MH format (this includes the Gnus nnml back end), although
it also works with mbox. Mairix presents the search results by
populating a "virtual" maildir/MH folder with symlinks which point to
the "real" message files (if mbox is used, copies are made).

== Requirements for using nnmairix ==

Mairix searches *local* mail - that means, mairix absolutely must have direct
access to your mail folders. If your mail resides on another server (e.g. an IMAP
server) and you happen to have shell access, nnmairix supports running mairix
remotely, e.g. via ssh.

Additionally, nnmairix only supports the following Gnus back ends: *nnml*, *nnmaildir*, and *nnimap*. 
*You must use one of these back ends for using nnmairix*. Other back ends, like nnmbox, nnfolder or nnmh, won't work.


== Features

Main features of nnmairix:

* Query mairix with a search term and display results in a group.
* Easy generation of search queries using the minibuffer or graphical widgets.
* Generate search queries based on the currently displayed mail.
* Create permanent nnmairix groups bound to certain mairix searches ("smart" groups).
* Jump to article in the original group.
* Update the mairix database.

== Setting up nnmairix.el ==

nnmairix is now part of Gnus and is currently in CVS.
If you don't want to completely 
switch to CVS Gnus, you can download the latest revision of nnmairix from CVS:

http://quimby.gnus.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/gnus/lisp/nnmairix.el?rev=HEAD

nnmairix should always work with the latest NoGnus release.

Put it in your emacs search path and put
<code>(require 'nnmairix)</code> into your .gnus (preferrably at the
beginning). You may also want to byte-compile it.

The documentation is also in CVS. You can checkout the latest TexInfo from

http://quimby.gnus.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/gnus/texi/gnus.texi?rev=HEAD

and compile it yourself using <code>makeinfo --force gnus.texi</code>. 

For a quick overview, you can also access the current nnmairix docs at

http://randomsample.de/nnmairix-doc/nnmairix.html

Please note that this is only the nnmairix node and not the complete Gnus documentation, so references to other nodes don't work.
