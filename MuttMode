I'm using Emacs as the editor for Mutt, and I'd like to use Supercite while doing so; however, I have not been able to get Supercite to work in this context. I have this feeling that it shouldn't be too hard... Has anybody succeeded? --DirkJanBinnema

: I'm not sure what exactly Supercite is, but if you want mutt to have emacs execute arbitrary lisp code, set editor="emacs %s --eval '(lisp-goes-here)'"; a good lisp-goes-here might be (supercite-mode t)? -- ErikBourget

Download link is dead. Anybody has an alternative location of mutt.el?

[new]
: Maybe http://www.lemis.com/grog/programs/emacs/emacs/mutt.el ? Not sure it's the same file.

Yes, it is, but il looks like an older revision. I've retrieved a more recent copy via archive.org, and saved it here: Lisp:mutt.el
