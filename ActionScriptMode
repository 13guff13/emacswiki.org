== Notes ==

* There are several entirely different modes all called actionscript-mode.
* You may need to rename the below-files to actionscript-mode.el to make them work.

== For AS2 ==

Emacs customizations and actionscript-mode for AS2: http://blog.pettomato.com/?p=12

== For AS3 ==

!ActionScript 3 is used in Adobe's Flex 2 and above

Austin Haas has created an actionscript-mode for AS3:
* Originally from http://blog.pettomato.com/?p=22 and http://blog.pettomato.com/?p=24
* Latest version from the above blog: Lisp:actionscript-mode-haas-7.0.el
** This does not work with newer Emacsen (CC-mode 5.30 and up)
** Also, there are a few indentation bugs.
* Somewhat older version which indents correctly and works with newer Emacsen: Lisp:actionscript-mode-haas-5.6.el

John Connors has also created an actionscript-mode for AS3: Lisp:actionscript-mode-connors.el

This [Connor's mode] works for me in Aquamacs under OS X.  Thanks for making it available.

This [Connor's mode] somewhat works for me (AmitPatel), but indentation of nested array literals doesn't indent properly.  For example, 
<pre>
public var sides:Array = [
[new Point(300, 300), new Point(300, 100)],
[new Point(300, 100), new Point(100, 100)],
[new Point(100, 100), new Point(100, 300)],
[new Point(100, 300), new Point(300, 300)]
                            ];
</pre>
