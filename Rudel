== Introduction ==

Rudel is a collaborative editing environment for GNU Emacs. It
supports multiple backends to enable communication with other
collaborative editors using different protocols (most notably
[http://gobby.0x539.de/trac/ Gobby]).

Rudel mostly works in the background to change the behavior of the set
of Emacs buffers for which it has been activated. These do not even
have to have a certain minor mode enabled.

The user interface of Rudel consists of a set of key bindings, a menu
entry and some visual status indicators, which are added to the text
and mode line of buffers for which Rudel has been activated. This user
interface is realized as a global minor mode.

The image below shows a collaborative editing session with one Gobby
and two Rudel clients (only one of these is visible).

== Download ==

Archives of released versions can be downloaded from the
[https://sourceforge.net/project/platformdownload.php?group_id=249139
download area] of the [http://sourceforge.net/projects/rudel
Sourceforge project page].

Development versions are available via the Subversion repository on
Sourceforge. Use the
[http://sourceforge.net/scm/?type=svn&group_id=249139 checkout
instructions] to obtain a copy of the source tree or
[http://rudel.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/rudel/ just browse the code].

Since CEDET can be difficult to install, (and unfortunately is not in ELPA due to the maintainer's uncooperativeness) here's some help:

<pre>
(defun load-rudel ()
  (interactive)
  ;; Do these in a shell in ~/src:
  ;; cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cedet.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/cedet login 
  ;; cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cedet.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/cedet co -P cedet
  ;; svn co https://rudel.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/rudel/rudel/trunk rudel
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/src/cedet/eieio")
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/src/cedet/common")
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/src/rudel/")
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/src/rudel/jupiter")
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/src/rudel/obby")
  (require 'rudel-mode)
  (require 'rudel-obby)
  (global-rudel-minor-mode))
</pre>

Autoloads and byte-compilation don't work for me due to a strange cedet dependency problem, but this should get you in a working state.

== Installation ==

/This section is a verbatim copy of the INSTALL file./

=== Requirements ===

Rudel is developed and tested only with GNU Emacs and therefore
unlikely to run on other Emacs variants like XEmacs.

To use Rudel, the following additional software is required:

* *GNU Emacs 22 or above*
   Rudel should work with recent versions of GNU Emacs starting from
   version 22. Older versions of GNU Emacs or XEmacs may or may not work
   but are not actively tested.

* *Collection of Emacs Development Environment Tools*
  [[CEDET]] contains the object system [[EIEIO]], which is used in
  Rudel's object-oriented implementation. [[CEDET]] can be obtained
  from [http://cedet.sourceforge.net/]. It is necessary to use at least
  version 1.0pre6 of [[CEDET]] since a serious problem in the object
  system [[EIEIO]] was fixed in that release.

* *!GnuTLS (optional)*
  Encrypted connections to Gobby servers require the gnutls-cli
  program.

=== Installing ===

To install Rudel, download a releases version or the current
development version from [http://sourceforge.net/projects/rudel/] and
place the code in any directory you like.

If your Emacs load path does not already contain the directory in
which the code resides, add the following to your .emacs file
(assuming the code resides in a directory called `SOMEDIR/rudel'):

{{{
(add-to-list 'load-path "SOMEDIR/rudel/")
(add-to-list 'load-path "SOMEDIR/rudel/jupiter/")
(add-to-list 'load-path "SOMEDIR/rudel/obby/")
}}}

This will allow Emacs to load Rudel code, but will not actually load
Rudel. To avoid loading all the Rudel code in every Emacs session, I
recommend auto loading. Auto loading information is stored in a file
called `rudel-loaddefs.el' which can be generated by executing

{{{
make autoloads
}}}

in the `rudel' directory (or equivalent) mentioned above. Once the
file has been generated, auto loading of Rudel can be activated
permanently by executing

{{{
(load "SOMEDIR/rudel/rudel-loaddefs.el")
}}}

in your .emacs file.

=== Compiling ===

In order to achieve better performance, Emacs can byte-compiled the
Rudel code. This can be done by executing

{{{
make rudel obby jupiter
}}}

or just (which will also generate auto loading information)

{{{
make
}}}

in the `rudel' directory (or equivalent) mentioned above.

== Development ==

If you would like to contribute to Rudel by submitting patches or
reporting bugs, use Feedback section below,
[http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=249139 the mailing list] or
[http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=249139 the issue tracker].

For long term contributions, becoming a member of the Sourceforge
project is more appropriate.
