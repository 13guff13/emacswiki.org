=Introduction=
pacman.el is an emacs mode that's written to interact with the Archlinux package manager, pacman.

=Installation=
https://github.com/bbetances/conf-scripts/blob/master/emacs-dir/custom-modes/pacman.el

wget that file, or clone the base repo, put it in your .emacs.d, and require it in .emacs

Sooner or later, I'll move it to its own repo, and streamline the installation process.

=Usage=
Once loaded, M-x pacman-mode to start it. The keybindings are all listed in the main buffer.
