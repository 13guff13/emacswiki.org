Auto away is not enabled by default. To enable it use M-x customize-variable RET erc-modules.

== Setting yourself automatically back when sending stuff in ERC ==

ERC used to have a feature to set yourself back as soon as you send
something to the server. This functionality has been moved to
erc-autoaway.el.

Add the following to your .emacs to enable it:

(setq erc-auto-discard-away t)

== Configuration of Auto-Away ==

You can configure the auto-away mechanism using the following two
variables.

 (setq erc-autoaway-idle-seconds 600)

tells erc-autoaway.el to set you away after 600 seconds (10 minutes)
of idletime. The default is 1800 seconds (30 minutes).

The variable

 erc-autoaway-message

contains a format string which will be used as an away reason. You can
insert the number of seconds being idle using %i. The default is

 "I'm gone (autoaway after %i seconds of idletime)"

=== Setting yourself automatically away when ERC is idle ===

To set yourself away after some idletime in ERC, add the following:

 (setq erc-auto-set-away t)

=== Setting yourself automatically away when Emacs is idle ===

To set yourself away after Emacs has been idle for some time, add the
following:

 (setq erc-autoaway-use-emacs-idle t)

This is only buggy at the moment, since the emacs idle timer gets
reset from time to time and I have no idea why.

The following will print ''meep'' in the minibuffer each time the
idletimer gets reset. It seems to happen ''sometimes'' when stuff
arrives through a process with a process filter attached. If you find
out more, please write me an email! mailto:forcer@forcix.cx

 (setq fc-idle-timer nil)
 (defun fc-idle-test ()
   (interactive)
   (when fc-idle-timer
     (cancel-timer fc-idle-timer))
   (setq fc-idle-num 0)
   (setq fc-idle-timer (run-with-idle-timer 1 t 'fc-idle-meep)))
 (defun fc-idle-meep ()
   (message "meep %i." fc-idle-num)
   (setq fc-idle-num (+ fc-idle-num 1)))
