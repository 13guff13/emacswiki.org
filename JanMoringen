Okay... I just upgraded to Ubuntu Lucid, which installed emacs23 (23.1.1). Canonical has now also removed Rudel, so I installed the latest tarball from the link above and it won't start. I get the following error on initializing with global-rudel-minor-mode:

Loading /usr/share/emacs23/site-lisp/rudel/rudel-loaddefs.el (source)...done
For information about GNU Emacs and the GNU system, type C-h C-a.
Making completion list...
Initializing Zeroconf ...
eval: Wrong number of arguments: #[(type backend) " 	D
B " [type backend rudel-zeroconf-service-types] 2 ("/usr/share/emacs23/site-lisp/rudel/zeroconf/rudel-zeroconf.elc" . 1445)], 3

Help?

I wasn't aware of the existence of a [[Rudel]] package for Ubuntu, but since your problem description presumably refers to the version available from sourceforge, it doesn't matter anyway.

From your description, I would assume that the previously installed version of Rudel (the Ubuntu package, if I understand correctly) left behind compiled Emacs Lisp files in /usr/share/emacs23/site-lisp/rudel/. As a first step, you could make sure that only files belonging to the newly installed Rudel version remain on your system. If that does not help, please set `debug-on-error' before calling `global-rudel-minor-mode' and paste the resulting backtrace along with the contents of the %%*Messages*%% buffer. Please also include the install location of the new Rudel version.

Hope that helps.

Interestingly enough, the Deb version of emacs has no `debug-on-error'; however, here is what was recorded in the messages window:

Initializing Zeroconf ...
eval: Wrong number of arguments: #[(type backend) " 	D
B " [type backend rudel-zeroconf-service-types] 2 ("/usr/share/emacs23/site-lisp/rudel/zeroconf/rudel-zeroconf.elc" . 1445)], 3

If you have any suggestions for an alternative to the `debug-on-error', let me know.

Thanks for your patience.

The error seems to happen when the byte-compiled version of the Zeroconf backend is loaded from /usr/share/emacs23/site-lisp/rudel/zeroconf/rudel-zeroconf.elc. It looks like files from more than one Rudel version got mixed up on your system.

To get a better picture, I need more information. Could you please answer the following questions:
* Is the tarball installed in /usr/share/emacs23/site-lisp/rudel/?
* If not, where is it installed?
* Did you remove or keep the Rudel Ubuntu package?
* How is Rudel loaded in your initialization file?

Please also provide the complete contents of the %%*Messages*%% buffer if there is no confidential information in it.

Regarding `debug-on-error': Did you try to call it as a function via M-x? You have to use M-x `toggle-debug-on-error' or the menu-entry Options > Debugger on Error.

Good luck.

Okay... I got this sorted out. It wasn't rudel at all, actually. It was sepia. Apparently there's some issue with sepia in Ubuntu Lucid/emacs23. Once I removed sepia and let dpkg reconfigure the debian version of emacs23, then hand reinstalled rudel, it works. We're back in business! 

(Now, why did Canonical remove rudel from their list, hmmmm? :> )

Jan,

Okay, after all that I had a catestrophic system crash and have had to do a complete reinstall (new mother board, etc. etc.) and now rudel is not cooperating again. I left you a message over on the rudel page of the wiki with the loading error.

Thanks!
