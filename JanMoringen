Okay... I just upgraded to Ubuntu Lucid, which installed emacs23 (23.1.1). Canonical has now also removed Rudel, so I installed the latest tarball from the link above and it won't start. I get the following error on initializing with global-rudel-minor-mode:

Loading /usr/share/emacs23/site-lisp/rudel/rudel-loaddefs.el (source)...done
For information about GNU Emacs and the GNU system, type C-h C-a.
Making completion list...
Initializing Zeroconf ...
eval: Wrong number of arguments: #[(type backend) " 	D
B " [type backend rudel-zeroconf-service-types] 2 ("/usr/share/emacs23/site-lisp/rudel/zeroconf/rudel-zeroconf.elc" . 1445)], 3

Help?

I wasn't aware of the existence of a [[Rudel]] package for Ubuntu, but since your problem description presumably refers to the version available from sourceforge, it doesn't matter anyway.

From your description, I would assume that the previously installed version of Rudel (the Ubuntu package, if I understand correctly) left behind compiled Emacs Lisp files in /usr/share/emacs23/site-lisp/rudel/. As a first step, you could make sure that only files belonging to the newly installed Rudel version remain on your system. If that does not help, please set `debug-on-error' before calling `global-rudel-minor-mode' and paste the resulting backtrace along with the contents of the %%*Messages*%% buffer. Please also include the install location of the new Rudel version.

Hope that helps.
