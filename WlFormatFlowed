To read flowed formated messages in Wanderlust put the following in your .wl file (you need flow-fill.el which included in the current emacs release):

 ;; Reading f=f
 (autoload 'fill-flowed "flow-fill")
 (add-hook 'mime-display-text/plain-hook
 	  (lambda ()
 	    (when (string= "flowed"
 			   (cdr (assoc "format"
 				       (mime-content-type-parameters
 					(mime-entity-content-type entity)))))
 	      (fill-flowed))))

If you want to write flowed formated messages:

 (mime-edit-insert-tag "text" "plain" "; format=flowed")
