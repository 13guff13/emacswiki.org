According to the Emacs manual,

: ''On most operating systems, rewriting a file automatically destroys all
record of what the file used to contain.  Thus, saving a file from Emacs
throws away the old contents of the file--or it would, except that
Emacs carefully copies the old contents to another file, called the
"backup" file, before actually saving.''

How backups are operated in Emacs is configurable to some degree.

{{{
(setq
   backup-by-copying t      ; don't clobber symlinks
   version-control t        ; use versioned backups
   delete-old-versions t
   kept-new-versions 6
   kept-old-versions 2)
}}}
