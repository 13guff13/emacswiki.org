Alex, can you sticky this post and make it a TOPIC in irc.

There is no way to make this post sticky. I've added it to [[News]], however.

Some questions:

# I read on the mailing-list that iswitchb was deprecated. [http://article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.devel/166061] Now what?
# What about suggested default settings such as dired-recursive-deletes, dired-recursive-copies, dired-dwim-target?

Alex: Stefan proposes icomplete as a replacement for iswitchb.

I see edit conflicts  (I thought they wouldn't happen) 

Can any of the admins suggest 

# a locking protocol
# rollback conflicts as needed

Please only add modes if you are using them.  Having every available minor-mode in there doesn't make sense and is only confusing.  Right now 2/3 of the entries are at use count 0.

Edit conflicts happen where differences cannot be merged using diff3. They seem unavoidable in a text where people keep editing the same cells of a table unless there is some live synchronization. This wiki uses very optimistic locking which makes it somewhat unsuitable for this kind of survey.

Feel free to rollback or resolve conflicts yourself. Visit the page history and start from there. If you have a username set, you will also see the rollback buttons.

I also feel that the list has grown totally out of control. I'm willing to look at ten or twenty entries, not five hundred entries or more.
