There is no way to make this post sticky. I've added it to [[News]], however.

Some questions:

# I read on the mailing-list that iswitchb was deprecated. [http://article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.devel/166061] Now what?
# What about suggested default settings such as dired-recursive-deletes, dired-recursive-copies, dired-dwim-target?

Alex: Stefan proposes icomplete as a replacement for iswitchb.
