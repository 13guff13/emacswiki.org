Alex, can you sticky this post and make it a TOPIC in irc.

There is no way to make this post sticky. I've added it to [[News]], however.

Some questions:

# I read on the mailing-list that iswitchb was deprecated. [http://article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.devel/166061] Now what?
# What about suggested default settings such as dired-recursive-deletes, dired-recursive-copies, dired-dwim-target?

Alex: Stefan proposes icomplete as a replacement for iswitchb.

I see edit conflicts  (I thought they wouldn't happen) 

Can any of the admins suggest 

# a locking protocol
# rollback conflicts as needed

Please only add modes if you are using them.  Having every available minor-mode in there doesn't make sense and is only confusing.  Right now 2/3 of the entries are at use count 0.

Edit conflicts happen where differences cannot be merged using diff3. They seem unavoidable in a text where people keep editing the same cells of a table unless there is some live synchronization. This wiki uses very optimistic locking which makes it somewhat unsuitable for this kind of survey.

Feel free to rollback or resolve conflicts yourself. Visit the page history and start from there. If you have a username set, you will also see the rollback buttons.

I also feel that the list has grown totally out of control. I'm willing to look at ten or twenty entries, not five hundred entries or more.

I've removed all the entries with use count 0 and the "major mode survey".  The latter is not really useful in this context and only confusing or a barrier to the actual goal of all of this.

Resolved numerous, accumulated edit conflicts.

'''''When you edit, please check for a conflict after saving, and if there was one then FIX IT IMMEDIATELY.'''''

(Unlocked the page. Locked it while cleaning up conflicts.)

blink-cursor-mode has a lot of votes, but it's enabled by default. Are the votes for setting it to nil? (Count me in if that's the case)

I disable it as well!

The changes for revisions 115 and 116 look like the changes made by a confused person: the same IP increased the number of people surveyed by two but *decreased* some of the numbers. My suggestion would be to eliminate these changes.

I incremented the count for cua mode, but I only use it for rectangles. 

    (setq cua-enable-cua-keys nil)
    (cua-mode t)

Should that have not counted?

I also disable blink-cursor-mode...can't bear it, in fact.

I enable <tt>outline-minor-mode</tt> in <tt>emacs-lisp-mode</tt> and <tt>perl-mode</tt>.  

<tt>reveal-mode</tt> goes well with <tt>outline-minor-mode</tt>.  See http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/2013-10/msg00327.html

Lately, I have been experimenting with <tt>visual-line-mode</tt> on plain text files.

In <tt>message-mode</tt> buffers, I have <tt>orgstruct++-mode</tt> and <tt>orgtbl-mode</tt> enabled.
