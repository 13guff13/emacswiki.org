Hello.  My name is Ben Wing and I'm the author of most of the code in XEmacs.  I've been involved in XEmacs (and Lucid Emacs before that) since 1992.  I'm currently a graduate student in Linguistics at the University of Texas, Austin.  

* You can reach me via mail: mailto:ben@xemacs.org.

Also known as [::benwing].

Welcome to the wiki!  I've added "benwing" as an anchor instead of adding a redirect from benwing to this page.
I hope that's ok with you.  We've been doing this for IRC nicks, too -- eg. [[kensanata]] links to the anchor
on my page. -- AlexSchroeder
