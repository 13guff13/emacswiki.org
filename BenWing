Welcome to the wiki!  I've added "benwing" as an anchor instead of adding a redirect from benwing to this page.
I hope that's ok with you.  We've been doing this for IRC nicks, too -- eg. [[kensanata]] links to the anchor
on my page. -- AlexSchroeder

LOL, Ben. Have you now been completely out of the programing industry? I heard of you earliest perhaps 10 years ago from your xemacs page... and because of my interest in emacs keyboarding and RSI stuff, have checked online info now and then over the years but never found much about you. Apparantly, your domain 666.com is now some chinese domain squatter. Your xemacs home page hasn't been update for 15 years? What's up? -- [[Xah Lee]], 2010-06-28
