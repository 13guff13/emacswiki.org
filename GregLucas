I've used GNU Emacs for years,  on Windows and OS X. These days I mostly use Emacs for

* Software development (Java, XML, stuff like that)
* Notes, planning, and so on with Org-Mode
* Tinkering with Emacs/Elisp

After my most recent declaration of .emacs bankruptcy I've started keeping my [https://github.com/glucas/dotemacs config] on github.
