It would be nice if Emacs was better at rendering tables.

An example is w3m rendering html. There is no "rowspan" feature for emacs images, so 
text flow gets broken when a large image comes along.

There is a nice new rendererer in Gnus, shr.el.

TODO describe hacks and posible display engine modifications
