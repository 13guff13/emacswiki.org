Hi. I'm Daniel, and "[::quotemstr]" in various places scattered across the
Internet. I'm the lead developer of for the

consummate Unix geek, and general fan of the outdoors. I read far too
much contemporary sociological non-fiction.

belief, we have quite a bit of culture and technology here, not to
mention sublime food.

I'm generally a fan of Common Lisp, Python, and C++ as far as
programming languages go.

I wrote [[byte-code-cache.el]] and
[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/JavaScriptMode#toc1 espresso-mode],
which will be the default Javascript mode in the next major version of
Emacs.
