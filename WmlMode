is a GPLed turn-based strategy game.

<code>wml-mode</code> is a major mode for editing Wesnoth Markup Language (WML) files.
Everything in the game (campaign, scenario, units, terrain e.t.c) are defined in WML.
Actually more than just a "markup Language" (it include conditional and function definition).

Get the mode from
