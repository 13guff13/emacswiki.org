=== What? ===

When the error- or message-functions in emacs on w32 is not enough for you.

=== The code ===

http://groups.google.com/groups?q=w32-msgbox

The latest version is 0.3 and was posted 2004-02-24, around 170.00 CET.

=== Prerequisites ===

* It relies on the cscript.exe vbscript interpreter. If it is not available (quite uncommon if you're not extremely paranoid), well, bad luck!

=== Test it ===

Test it with:

 M-: (w32-msgbox "Message" "Title" 'vb-yes-no-cancel 'vb-question 'vb-default-button-2 t)
