NTEmacs is commonly used to denote Emacs compiled as a native w32 application.
For precompiled versions and instructions on how to build see CategoryWThirtyTwo.

Why use NTEmacs with Cygwin?

Because Cygwin is wonderful ... but the Emacs that comes with it suffers from a few problems:
* It's kinda slow (although recent Cygwin builds of X seem faster -- 4.3.0-61, e.g.)
* I can't remember specific details, but I'm pretty sure the Cygwin X server is unreliable
* Using it under the Win32 console, as opposed to under X, is too painful, since the Meta key doesn't work properly (see CygwinMeta).

So I find myself using venerable NTEmacs, which is a native Win32 app (hence fast) with the Cygwin tools.

The following code will produce a reasonable approximation of Unix Emacs on NT:

  ;;;;
  ;;;; cygwin support
  ;;;;

  ;; Sets your shell to use cygwin's bash, if Emacs finds it's running
  ;; under Windows and c:\cygwin exists. Assumes that C:\cygwin\bin is
  ;; not already in your Windows Path (it generally should not be).
  ;;
  (let* ((cygwin-root "c:/cygwin")
         (cygwin-bin (concat cygwin-root "/bin")))
    (when (and (eq 'windows-nt system-type)
  	     (file-readable-p cygwin-root))
    
      (setq exec-path (cons cygwin-bin exec-path))
      (setenv "PATH" (concat cygwin-bin ";" (getenv "PATH")))
    
      ;; By default use the Windows HOME.
      ;; Otherwise, uncomment below to set a HOME
      ;;      (setenv "HOME" (concat cygwin-root "/home/eric"))
    
      ;; NT-emacs assumes a Windows shell. Change to baash.
      (setq shell-file-name "bash")
      (setenv "SHELL" shell-file-name) 
      (setq explicit-shell-file-name shell-file-name) 
    
      ;; This removes unsightly ^M characters that would otherwise
      ;; appear in the output of java applications.
      (add-hook 'comint-output-filter-functions 'comint-strip-ctrl-m)))

This code first verifies it is running under windows with cygwin installed, so this snippet can be safely placed in a .emacs file that is also used on emacs in unices.

You will also need Lisp:cygwin-mount.el if you want Emacs to understand Cygwin paths.

Note that this is substantially the same as the bit of code given in
the Cygwin FAQ: http://www.cygwin.com/faq/faq_3.html#SEC63

See CustomizingBoth to get fancier.

summary: cmd.exe can't deal with cygwin 'links'.

`shell-file-name' defaults to cmdproxy.exe - which simply prepends "/c " to the args and sends that to cmd.exe or command.com (NT, 9x).  But cmd.exe doesn't understand cygwin links, so the call to any such program fails - sometimes silently.  For instance: with my setup, gunzip.exe fails with Emacs reporting "(Shell command succeeded with no output)".

Poking around, I found Cygwin's gunzip.exe is 19 bytes long.  The contents are: "!<symlink>gzip.exe" (with a trailing ^@).

to fix this, either copy gzip.exe to gunzip.exe, or use "bash" as your `shell-file-name'

"Assumes that <code>C:\cygwin\bin</code> is not already in your Windows Path (it generally should not be)."

Why not?

The cygwin documentation itself seems to disagree: http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/setup-env.html

M-x rgrep may generate a find command which includes the null-device, and NTEmacs uses "NUL" (the Windows null device) rather than "/dev/null".

e.g.: <code>C-u C-u M-x rgrep RET</code> results in the following prompt:
<code>Run: find . -type f -exec grep -nH  {} NUL \;</code>

This causes the rgrep output to output numerous "grep: NUL: No such file or directory" errors.

We can advise the grep-compute-defaults function to make it see the cygwin null device when establishing the find command. Interestingly enough, this causes it to drop any mention of the null device, and pipe the find results through xargs instead of using -exec. I couldn't follow the logic, but the resulting command prompt is certainly fine.

<code>Run: find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 -e grep -nH -e </code>

You should restart emacs after adding this to your .emacs file (rather than just reloading .emacs), as the default find command is cached once it has been established, and will not be re-generated otherwise.

<pre>
;; Prevent issues with the Windows null device (NUL)
;; when using cygwin find with rgrep.
(defadvice grep-compute-defaults (around grep-compute-defaults-advice-null-device)
  "Use cygwin's /dev/null as the null-device."
  (let ((null-device "/dev/null"))
	ad-do-it))
(ad-activate 'grep-compute-defaults)
</pre>

Another option may be to use the <i>-r</i> option to /grep/ (this works with GNU grep) instead of piping to /find/.
I believe this should work for both the gnuwin32 grep and the cygwin grep.
There is an implementation of this in /w32-grep.el/ in [[EmacsW32]].
Could someone please test it with Cygwin?
(The file /w32-grep.el/ is only available in [[EmacsW32]], but you could mail me if you want a copy for testing.)
