I wonder whether something simple as this might be useful when listing pages with a particular prefix. The major drawback I see is that the resulting list is _not annotated_.

{{{
<include list "^AlexSchroeder">
}}}

<include list "^AlexSchroeder">

Sorry, I don't understand what the question/problem/use case is.

Is this about using ##<include list "^AlexSchroeder">## on a wiki page to display a list of links such as you show above?  What is the use case for that?
