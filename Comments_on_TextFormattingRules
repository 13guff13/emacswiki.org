I wonder whether something simple as this might be useful when listing pages with a particular prefix. The major drawback I see is that the resulting list is _not annotated_.

{{{
<include list "^AlexSchroeder">
}}}

<include list "^AlexSchroeder">

Sorry, I don't understand what the question/problem/use case is.

Is this about using ##<include list "^AlexSchroeder">## on a wiki page to display a list of links such as you show above?  What is the use case for that?

[[TextFormattingRules#new]] - alternate-row highlighting (''Alternate contributions (alternate [new]â€™s) are shaded,'') does not appear to be active (with the new CSS?).

Same goes for 
''Putting
<tt>
[<nowiki>new::</nowiki>]
</tt>
will insert your UserName, and adds a timestamp to your contribution when you save the page.  The timestamp appears when you move the mouse over the contribution.''

the ''mouse over'' sounds like a CSS/JS thing, which has little to do with markup, and everything to do with one particular form of presentation, which might change.
Plus, I'm not seeing the timestamp rendered to the HTML in any format, as of today.

Except for here in the talk section, where it is not a mouse-over effect.
