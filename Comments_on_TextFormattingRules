I wonder whether something simple as this might be useful when listing pages with a particular prefix. The major drawback I see is that the resulting list is _not annotated_.

{{{
<include list "^AlexSchroeder">
}}}

<include list "^AlexSchroeder">

Sorry, I don't understand what the question/problem/use case is.

Is this about using ##<include list "^AlexSchroeder">## on a wiki page to display a list of links such as you show above?  What is the use case for that?

[[TextFormattingRules#new]] - alternate-row highlighting (''Alternate contributions (alternate [new]â€™s) are shaded,'') does not appear to be active (with the new CSS?).

Same goes for 
''Putting
<tt>
[<nowiki>new::</nowiki>]
</tt>
will insert your UserName, and adds a timestamp to your contribution when you save the page.  The timestamp appears when you move the mouse over the contribution.''

the ''mouse over'' sounds like a CSS/JS thing, which has little to do with markup, and everything to do with one particular form of presentation, which might change.
Plus, I'm not seeing the timestamp rendered to the HTML in any format, as of today.

Except for here in the talk section, where it is not a mouse-over effect.

Yes, obviously the text needs to be changed.

As for the timestamp, it's still there: ##<div class="color one level0"><div class="portrait"><p><a class="newauthor" title="2013-04-30 09:34 UTC" href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs-en/AlexSchroeder"><img class="portrait" src="http://alexschroeder.ch/pics/alex-drinking-coffee-48-bw.jpg" alt="new: 2013-04-30 09:34 UTC" /></a> <br /> <a class="local" href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs-en/AlexSchroeder">AlexSchroeder</a></p></div>## and it still renders as a tool-tip when I hover over the image with the mouse.

Shouldn't '''official''' documentation be included here? Or certainly have more prominence.
I'm surprised to find an offsite-link buried in a sub-section.

Well, I guess we could just copy the documentation over, possibly rewrite it. But what purpose would it serve? Who will maintain the documentation here if features change? As for it being buried in a subsection, I guess it's a question of priorities: which information do you need to learn right away? Which information is most likely to be be useful and remain so for a long time? And which information is tricky, for the advanced users, for the rare use cases?
