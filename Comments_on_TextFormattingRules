I wonder whether something simple as this might be useful when listing pages with a particular prefix. The major drawback I see is that the resulting list is _not annotated_.

{{{
<include list "^AlexSchroeder">
}}}

<include list "^AlexSchroeder">

Sorry, I don't understand what the question/problem/use case is.

Is this about using ##<include list "^AlexSchroeder">## on a wiki page to display a list of links such as you show above?  What is the use case for that?

[[TextFormattingRules#new]] - alternate-row highlighting (''Alternate contributions (alternate [new]â€™s) are shaded,'') does not appear to be active (with the new CSS?).

Same goes for 
''Putting
<tt>
[<nowiki>new::</nowiki>]
</tt>
will insert your UserName, and adds a timestamp to your contribution when you save the page.  The timestamp appears when you move the mouse over the contribution.''

the ''mouse over'' sounds like a CSS/JS thing, which has little to do with markup, and everything to do with one particular form of presentation, which might change.
Plus, I'm not seeing the timestamp rendered to the HTML in any format, as of today.

Except for here in the talk section, where it is not a mouse-over effect.

Yes, obviously the text needs to be changed.

As for the timestamp, it's still there: ##<div class="color one level0"><div class="portrait"><p><a class="newauthor" title="2013-04-30 09:34 UTC" href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs-en/AlexSchroeder"><img class="portrait" src="http://alexschroeder.ch/pics/alex-drinking-coffee-48-bw.jpg" alt="new: 2013-04-30 09:34 UTC" /></a> <br /> <a class="local" href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs-en/AlexSchroeder">AlexSchroeder</a></p></div>## and it still renders as a tool-tip when I hover over the image with the mouse.

Shouldn't '''official''' documentation be included here? Or certainly have more prominence.
I'm surprised to find an offsite-link buried in a sub-section.

-- MichaelPaulukonis 2013-04-30 12:59 UTC

Well, I guess we could just copy the documentation over, possibly rewrite it. But what purpose would it serve? Who will maintain the documentation here if features change? As for it being buried in a subsection, I guess it's a question of priorities: which information do you need to learn right away? Which information is most likely to be be useful and remain so for a long time? And which information is tricky, for the advanced users, for the rare use cases? Is there anything in particular you were looking for which you missed when you looked for it here? If so, do you think many people will want to use it? If so, let's copy it over. If you found something here that was wrong or incomplete, however, the decision to make is different: is it something many people will want to use? Let's fix it. Is it something that rarely comes up? Perhaps we're better off just deleting it and referring people to the "official" documentation (which might itself be in need of improvements, unfortunately).

I've been using the emacswiki on-and-off for... 5 years? I never noticed the link to external documentation until today. Promoting those links would help.

However, once I go there, there's a jarring visual difference.

Plus, if somebody needs to edit the docs, they... can't on the external site? Or they'll have to have author-priviledges and pages on two sites.

I use [[http://www.pmwiki.org|PmWiki]] a lot. Each install ships with the documentation for that version. That way all docs are local, can be transcluded, modified, extended, etc. Yes, there is an issue with newer docs for newer versions on the host trickling down to upgraded installs, although it's never really been a problem. It seems the current method may not have been a problem for anybody but me.....

So.... the hover-effect has nothing to do with the name, and everything to do with the pictures? I'm not seeing any hover-effect here with the names. I'm using Aurora 22.02a on Win7.

Also, the timestamps are still not appearing for me in rendered output (in pages; they're appearing automatically in comments). From from NodeJs:

{{{
[new:OtherMichael:2013-04-28 19:59 UTC]Question: But does it still work with newer versions of node.js ?
}}}

renders as

{{{
<div class="color one level0"><p>Question: But does it still work with newer versions of node.js ?</p></div>
}}}

Is it possible to have an inlined-image, from an external source, link to something?

like, say, <code>[[http://www.fsf.org/register_form?referrer=8082 https://static.fsf.org/nosvn/associate/fsf-8082.png]]</code>

So that the image is rendered, '''and''' it functions as a link?

If this exists, I couldn't find the formatting

Is there a convention for the formatting of keyboard shortcuts and elisp function names?
For example how would one mark up  M-x ediff-regions-wordwise ?

-- jasonblewis 2013-05-31 02:11 UTC


----

Use ##`...'##.  E.g., Here's an example of using the `M-x' key to execute command `ediff-regions-wordwise': `M-x ediff-regions-wordwise'.

You can also show code snippets by indenting them (space chars before each line) or wrapping the set of lines with ##{{{## and ##}}}##. Example:

{{{
   M-x ediff-regions-wordwise
}}}
