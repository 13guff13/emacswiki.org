I  have used emacs since university (late 80s).  My primary use is writing text in XML with NxmlMode.

I am a financial advisor with <nowiki>ScotiaMcLeod</nowiki>.  My [http://www.dougransom.com financial advisor Professional Site ] was written in emacs and a bit of XSLT/make/Python I have gimbled together.
