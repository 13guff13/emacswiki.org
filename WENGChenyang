I am WENG Chenyang. I begin to use emacs early this year (2016). I am not a programmer, but an mechanical engineer. In my everyday workï¼ŒI work mainly with AutoCAD, MS Word, and Ansys. Then one day I began to learn a little about autolisp, vbs and APDL. I was using PSPad editor, but it seemed that there was some problem with my installation, the PSPad Editor crash time to time. Then I came to emacs, with courage.

I take metro to work, and read a litte about emacs everyday, becoming more and more fond of it. Sometimes I came cross problems with emacs, it usually cost me lots of time to solve, often during the weekend, trival problems through. But now, I am more confifendt in front of emacs.

I use emacs on windows, mainly in the following ways:
1. take notes, with org-mode;
2. write calculation report, with calc-embeded mode;
3. write ahk and vbs script;
4. version control with magit.

Forgive me for not knowing much about the wiki foramatting rule, I will fix it later.

I have got a lot of useful knowledge from the emacs wiki. So thank you, and I will contribute in my part.
