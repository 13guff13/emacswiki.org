<code>htmlize.el</code> by HrvojeNiksic is a package for converting Emacs fontification (colours, italics, etc) into HTML.  Get it from,

* The author at http://fly.srk.fer.hr/~hniksic/emacs/htmlize.el.cgi
* On [[Debian]] in DebianPackage:emacs-goodies-el
* Already in [[XEmacs]] elisp packages collection, in the text-modes package

The conversion is quite sophisticated, it understands non-ascii characters, looks up colours in the X11 RGB database, and can generate either <code>css</code> or old style <code>font</code> bits.

The main use for <code>htmlize</code> is to convert FontLock decoration into a format which other tools can use, such as for web display, printing, etc.

The following packages use or extend <code>htmlize</code>,

* PrintWithWebBrowser -- print a buffer through your web browser
** WThirtyTwoFontifiedRegionToClipboard -- similar with MS Word
* SaveAsHtml -- extending to htmlify links like Info and Dired

See also HtmlFontify which does similar things (and hopefully will be included in Emacs soon). However, HtmlFontify appears not to support converting a region which is really practical for publishing small snippets on blogs.

[new]
Converting a region is supported in hfyview.el (which uses htmlfontify.el).

You can use this package to render code snippets with syntax highlighting when exporting Org-mode files to HTML.

See also [http://www.students.itu.edu.tr/~yazicivo/files/htmlize.tar.gz htmlize.sh] by Volkan YAZICI which is a small *shell* *script* wrapped around htmlize.el with some syntax highligting enhancements for particular emacs modes. Moreover, htmlize.sh has an extensible syntax  recognition enhancement module that you can introduce new functionalities relatively easily; e.g., it provides CLHS and MOP symbol linking  capabities for  lisp-mode. (See [http://www.students.itu.edu.tr/~yazicivo/files/htmlize.README.txt README] file for details.)
