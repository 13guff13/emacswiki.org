I am a  newbie. I use Emacs 23 on Gentoo(Linux) and  Windows since 2010-10--.

 My E-mail is: jixiuf@gmail.com

I come from China; my Chinese name is 纪秀峰.
"Joseph" sounds like my Chinese name, that's why I use it as my English name. Please forgive my poor English.
 
My Emacs config file is published on github:
[https://github.com/jixiuf/emacs_conf MyEmacsConfigFiles].

All my code also available: [https://github.com/jixiuf MyPage].
I have a Chinese blog at [http://blog.csdn.net/jixiuffff MyBlog].
