== Open Icicles Issues ==

This page is for discussion of open issues you might have with library '''<tt>[[icicles.el]]</tt>''' ('''[[Icicles]]'''), including bugs.

See also:

* IciclesIssuesStale -- Issues that users did not follow up on -- never heard back from them. Could mean that the problem is not a problem; could mean that they gave up ;-).

* IciclesIssuesClosed -- Issues that were resolved. Bugs that were fixed. Explanations of non-bugs. Issues from this page (IciclesIssuesOpen) and IciclesIssuesStale are moved there when they are resolved.

* IciclesDiscussion -- General discussion about the library, feedback, possible uses, and possible enhancements.




=== How To Report an Icicles Issue ===

You can report an '''Icicles''' issue (bug) on this page -- please follow the formatting suggestion provided below ([[#HowToUseThisPage]]).

Alternatively, you can report an '''Icicles''' issue by email, by doing 
one of the following:

* Choose item '''Send Bug Report''' from MenuBar menu '''Icicles'''
* `##M-x icicle-send-bug-report##'
* (1) `C-h' from the minibuffer; (2) click button '''Icicles Options and Faces''' in buffer `*Help*'; (3) click link `##Send Bug Report##' in buffer `##*Customize Group: icicles*##'

Always mention your Emacs version and platform (e.g. Windows, GNU/Linux). If you aren't using the latest '''Icicles''' files, let me know which you are using. '''Icicles''' files each have an <code>Update #</code> field in the header, which identifies the file exactly.

The advantage of reporting a bug here is that others can share in the discussion. The advantage of reporting a bug by email is that I will see it immediately. Sometimes I don't notice a bug report on this page for a while.




=== Debugging Tips ===

1. If you use the debugger to report a backtrace, first delete all '''Icicles''' byte-compiled files, so that you use only the source files (##icicles*.el##) for debugging.

2. By default, in ''Icicle'' mode, `M-x' is bound to command '''`icicle-execute-extended-command''''. This is a multi-command, which presents certain advantages over the standard command bound to `M-x' in Emacs, `execute-extended-command' -- see [[Icicles - Multi M-x]] for details.

However, `icicle-execute-extended-command' has one disadvantage: an error backtrace is less informative, which can make debugging more difficult. If you want to see a normal backtrace at the point of error, then do what I do:

  M-: (define-key icicle-mode-map "\M-x" 'execute-extended-command)
  M-x set-variable debug-on-error t

Running the latest icicles as of 17 Feb, 2009 on Emacs 23.1.1
Icicles appends a '/' when there is a single completion for a directory when running find-file.

Here is the file structure:
<pre>
~/maindir/
          subdir/
                 file
</pre>
      
And here is how to reproduce:
<pre>           
~/> emacs -q
require 'icicles [<RET>]
M-x icy-mode [<RET>]

[C-xC-f]
+ File or directory (/): ~/
[main<TAB>]
+ File or directory (/): ~/maindir/ [Sole prefix completion]
[<TAB>]
+ File or directory (/): ~/maindir// [Sole prefix completion]  <-- unexpected append of '/'
[<TAB>]
  *Completions* opens with a listing of all the files in /
</pre>
 In emacs -q it works as expected
<pre>
[C-xC-f]
Find file: ~/
[main<TAB>]
Find file: ~/maindir/
[<TAB>]
Find file: ~/maindir/subdir/
[<TAB>]
Find file: ~/maindir/subdir/file
</pre>

It works as expected when the only completion is a regular file.

The following also works:
<pre>
[C-xC-f]
+ File or directory (/): ~/
[main<TAB>]
+ File or directory (/): ~/maindir/ [Sole prefix completion]
[.<S-TAB>]
  *Completions* opens with the following content:

Click <mouse-2> or type RET on a completion to select it.  (C-?: help) 
Possible completions are:
../						   subdir/
</pre>
The following also works:
<pre>
[C-xC-f]
+ File or directory (/): ~/
[main<TAB>]
+ File or directory (/): ~/maindir/ [Sole prefix completion]
[s<TAB>]
+ File or directory (/): ~/maindir/subdir/ [Sole prefix completion]
</pre>

I have tried this on 21.3.1 and it seems to work normally. -- iulianov

Thanks for your report, Iulianov. Yes, I know about this bug. I just haven't found the time yet to fix it. I'll get to it eventually. Sorry for the trouble. Thx -- DrewAdams



[new:DrewAdams:2010-04-13 18:21 UTC]
Sorry it took a while, but I think this is fixed now. Please try the latest version and let me know if you find any problems. Sorry for the trouble.  Thx -- DrewAdams
