== Open Icicles Issues ==

This page is for discussion of open issues you might have with library '''<tt>[[icicles.el]]</tt>''' ('''[[Icicles]]'''), including bugs.

See also:

* IciclesIssuesStale -- Issues that users did not follow up on -- never heard back from them. Could mean that the problem is not a problem; could mean that they gave up ;-).

* IciclesIssuesClosed -- Issues that were resolved. Bugs that were fixed. Explanations of non-bugs. Issues from this page (IciclesIssuesOpen) and IciclesIssuesStale are moved there when they are resolved.

* IciclesDiscussion -- General discussion about the library, feedback, possible uses, and possible enhancements.




=== How To Report an Icicles Issue ===

You can report an '''Icicles''' issue (bug) on this page -- please follow the formatting suggestion provided below ([[#HowToUseThisPage]]).

Alternatively, you can report an '''Icicles''' issue by email, by doing 
one of the following:

* Choose item '''Send Bug Report''' from MenuBar menu '''Icicles'''
* `##M-x icicle-send-bug-report##'
* (1) `C-h' from the minibuffer; (2) click button '''Icicles Options and Faces''' in buffer `*Help*'; (3) click link `##Send Bug Report##' in buffer `##*Customize Group: icicles*##'

Always mention your Emacs version and platform (e.g. Windows, GNU/Linux). If you aren't using the latest '''Icicles''' files, let me know which you are using. '''Icicles''' files each have an <code>Update #</code> field in the header, which identifies the file exactly.

The advantage of reporting a bug here is that others can share in the discussion. The advantage of reporting a bug by email is that I will see it immediately. Sometimes I don't notice a bug report on this page for a while.




=== Debugging Tips ===

1. If you use the debugger to report a backtrace, first delete all '''Icicles''' byte-compiled files, so that you use only the source files (##icicles*.el##) for debugging.

2. By default, in ''Icicle'' mode, `M-x' is bound to command '''`icicle-execute-extended-command''''. This is a multi-command, which presents certain advantages over the standard command bound to `M-x' in Emacs, `execute-extended-command' -- see [[Icicles - Multi M-x]] for details.

However, `icicle-execute-extended-command' has one disadvantage: an error backtrace is less informative, which can make debugging more difficult. If you want to see a normal backtrace at the point of error, then do what I do:

  M-: (define-key icicle-mode-map "\M-x" 'execute-extended-command)
  M-x set-variable debug-on-error t

When I use your icicles in emacs22, I get a message "Symbol's function definition is void: icicle-shell-command". -- [[ahei]]


[new:DrewAdams:2009-11-06 18:46 UTC]
Sorry, that doesn't help me enough. I don't see that problem in Emacs 22.1, 22.2, or 22.3. Perhaps something from your [[init file]] is interfering. 

Please (always) provide a recipe to reproduce the problem, starting with ##emacs -Q##. It's probably easiest to correspond by email -- use `M-x icicle-send-bug-report'. -- DrewAdams

[new]
Oh, I'm sorry for that. I found the reason, kde-emacs is conflict icicles, I must load icicles before kde-emacs in emac22, otherwise will get that error message.
and, MultiTerm is also conflict with icicles in emacs 22 and 23, must load icicles before multiterm, otherwise, when exit ediff, will get message "Lisp nesting exceeds `max-lisp-eval-depth'".  -- [[ahei]]

[new:DrewAdams:2009-11-08 08:49 UTC]
Could you maybe investigate a bit what the problem was? In general, '''Icicles''' does its best to not depend on the order of loading or on when ''Icicle'' mode is activated. But that can be tricky. It would be good to understand just what the problem was -- either to improve '''Icicles''' or to provide info to the maintainers of the other libraries, so they can fix things if appropriate.

One thing you might try would be to use the load order that doesn't work correctly and then try to toggle `icy-mode' twice, to see if that fixes the problem. That might give us some info about it. 

If you don't have the time to investigate, that's OK, but if you could, it would be helpful, either to '''Icicles''' or possibly to the other libraries. Anyway, I'm glad you found a workaround, and thanks for trying '''Icicles'''. -- DrewAdams
