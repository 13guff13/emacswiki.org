== Open Icicles Issues ==

This page is for discussion of open issues you might have with library '''<tt>[[icicles.el]]</tt>''' ('''[[Icicles]]'''), including bugs.

See also:

* IciclesIssuesStale -- Issues that users did not follow up on -- never heard back from them. Could mean that the problem is not a problem; could mean that they gave up ;-).

* IciclesIssuesClosed -- Issues that were resolved. Bugs that were fixed. Explanations of non-bugs. Issues from this page (IciclesIssuesOpen) and IciclesIssuesStale are moved there when they are resolved.

* IciclesDiscussion -- General discussion about the library, feedback, possible uses, and possible enhancements.


=== How To Report an Icicles Issue ===

You can report an '''Icicles''' issue (bug) on this page -- please follow the formatting suggestion provided below ([[#HowToUseThisPage]]).

Alternatively, you can report an '''Icicles''' issue by email, by doing 
one of the following:

* Choose item '''Send Bug Report''' from MenuBar menu '''Icicles'''
* `##M-x icicle-send-bug-report##'
* (1) `C-h' from the minibuffer; (2) click button '''Icicles Options and Faces''' in buffer `*Help*'; (3) click link `##Send Bug Report##' in buffer `##*Customize Group: icicles*##'

Always mention your Emacs version and platform (e.g. Windows, GNU/Linux). If you aren't using the latest '''Icicles''' files, let me know which you are using. '''Icicles''' files each have an <code>Update #</code> field in the header, which identifies the file exactly.

The advantage of reporting a bug here is that others can share in the discussion. The advantage of reporting a bug by email is that I will see it immediately. Sometimes I don't notice a bug report on this page for a while.




=== Debugging Tips ===

1. If you use the debugger to report a backtrace, first delete all '''Icicles''' byte-compiled files, so that you use only the source files (##icicles*.el##) for debugging.

2. By default, in ''Icicle'' mode, `M-x' is bound to command '''`icicle-execute-extended-command''''. This is a multi-command, which presents certain advantages over the standard command bound to `M-x' in Emacs, `execute-extended-command' -- see [[Icicles - Multi M-x]] for details.

However, `icicle-execute-extended-command' has one disadvantage: an error backtrace is less informative, which can make debugging more difficult. If you want to see a normal backtrace at the point of error, then do what I do:

  M-: (define-key icicle-mode-map "\M-x" 'execute-extended-command)
  M-x set-variable debug-on-error t

When I try icicle-find-file and if I press ENTER without changing the default value which is current working directory, nothing happens. I expect the dired buffer of current working directory would appear. Tested with ##GNU Emacs 23.1.1 (i686-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 2.10.4) of## built by me. Tested while running ##emacs -Q## and only invoking icicles.

Thanks for the report, Thomas.  Should be fixed now -- let me know.

It's weird, but on 2008/12/27 I specifically changed from what I have now to what I just replaced for this fix.  I don't recall why.  So it's possible this fix will break something else ;-) -- we'll see.  Thx -- DrewAdams

It's fixed. Thank you, Drew. -- ThomasLim

With the latest icicles files updated via icicles-install there is a problem with the GNU emacs 23.1.97 final release candidate for 23.2 that doesn't occur for 23.1.

<pre>
(add-to-list 'load-path "...")
(require 'icicles-install)
(require 'icicles)
</pre>

fails with:

##debugger entered--Lisp error: (wrong-type-argument listp 2C-command)##

Adding the following lines fixes the problem

<pre>
(add-to-list 'load-path "...")
(require 'icicles-install)
(require 'two-column)
(require 'icicles)
</pre>

Sorry -- wiki formatting is perplexing. -- [[Gen.Sec.]]

I cannot reproduce the problem - please provide more info (e.g. ##*Messages*## output that might be pertinent, ##*Backtrace*## buffer, precise recipe to follow,...). If you use the debugger, be sure to load the source files (##*.el##, not ##*.elc##).

I tried with ##emacs -Q## using only the source files (##*.el##), and I tried again using the ##*.elc## files byte-compiled using the same Emacs 23-1-97 prerelease.  It's best to test using ##emacs -Q## and loading only the source files (##*.el##, not ##*.elc##). If you do test using byte-compiled files, be sure they are freshly compiled.)

Also, be sure you have all the latest '''Icicles''' files. I'm not responsible for <tt>[[icicles-install.el]]</tt>, so I cannot tell you whether it always does the right thing. I assume it does, but to be sure you might want to compare the dates or the ##Update## numbers in the file headers of each file downloaded with those currently posted on the wiki at the ElispArea. Sorry for your trouble. -- DrewAdams
