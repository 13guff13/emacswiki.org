== Open Icicles Issues ==

This page is for discussion of open issues you might have with library '''<tt>[[icicles.el]]</tt>''' ('''[[Icicles]]'''), including bugs.

See also:

* IciclesIssuesStale -- Issues that users did not follow up on -- never heard back from them. Could mean that the problem is not a problem; could mean that they gave up ;-).

* IciclesIssuesClosed -- Issues that were resolved. Bugs that were fixed. Explanations of non-bugs. Issues from this page (IciclesIssuesOpen) and IciclesIssuesStale are moved there when they are resolved.

* IciclesDiscussion -- General discussion about the library, feedback, possible uses, and possible enhancements.


=== How To Report an Icicles Issue ===

You can report an '''Icicles''' issue (bug) on this page -- please follow the formatting suggestion provided below ([[#HowToUseThisPage]]).

Alternatively, you can report an '''Icicles''' issue by email, by doing 
one of the following:

* Choose item '''Send Bug Report''' from MenuBar menu '''Icicles'''
* `##M-x icicle-send-bug-report##'
* (1) `C-h' from the minibuffer; (2) click button '''Icicles Options and Faces''' in buffer `*Help*'; (3) click link `##Send Bug Report##' in buffer `##*Customize Group: icicles*##'

Always mention your Emacs version and platform (e.g. Windows, GNU/Linux). If you aren't using the latest '''Icicles''' files, let me know which you are using. '''Icicles''' files each have an <code>Update #</code> field in the header, which identifies the file exactly.

The advantage of reporting a bug here is that others can share in the discussion. The advantage of reporting a bug by email is that I will see it immediately. Sometimes I don't notice a bug report on this page for a while.




=== Debugging Tips ===

1. If you use the debugger to report a backtrace, first delete all '''Icicles''' byte-compiled files, so that you use only the source files (##icicles*.el##) for debugging.

2. By default, in ''Icicle'' mode, `M-x' is bound to command '''`icicle-execute-extended-command''''. This is a multi-command, which presents certain advantages over the standard command bound to `M-x' in Emacs, `execute-extended-command' -- see [[Icicles - Multi M-x]] for details.

However, `icicle-execute-extended-command' has one disadvantage: an error backtrace is less informative, which can make debugging more difficult. If you want to see a normal backtrace at the point of error, then do what I do:

  M-: (define-key icicle-mode-map "\M-x" 'execute-extended-command)
  M-x set-variable debug-on-error t

I have a problem with apropos completion, as described in IciclesIssuesClosed, but I do not quite understand the discussion there. I would appreciate any help or a suggestion of where to look for help, and I can move this question to the thread in the Closed Issues page. 

I put the Icicles libraries on my load path, add ##(require 'icicles)## to my file ~/.emacs, start emacs, and execute ##M-x icy-mode##; The echo area shows "Turning ON Icicle mode...done". Then I type ##M-x buffer S-Tab##, and the echo area shows ##<backtab> is undefined##. I use Emacs 22.2.1. File <tt>[[icicles-opt.el]]</tt> says:

<pre>
In Emacs 22 and later, `backtab' is the canonical key that represents
both `S-tab' and `S-iso-lefttab', so that is used in the default
value.  If, for some reason, `backtab' is not being translated to
`S-tab' and `S-iso-lefttab' on your platform, you might want to
customize the value to ([S-tab] [S-iso-lefttab]).  And if your Emacs
version is 22 or later, please file an Emacs bug about the lack of
translation.
</pre>

I did not find a way to customize "backtab" to the value "([S-tab] [S-iso-lefttab])". Also, putting ##(setq icicle-generic-S-tab-keys '([S-tab] [S-iso-lefttab]))## in my init files did not help. -- PhilipGanchev


[new:DrewAdams:2010-04-15 17:45 UTC]
First, please make sure you have the latest '''Icicles''' files. `backtab' is not used as the default value, and `icicle-generic-S-tab-keys' no longer exists (it is called `icicle-key-complete-keys' now).

The comment you quote is out of date (I've just changed it). `backtab' is not used as the default value because of what is mentioned in the other comment just before that one -- see Emacs bug #1281.

The value you were trying to get is in fact the default value. It means that ##[S-tab]## and ##[S-iso-lefttab]## will be bound for '''Icicles''' apropos completion. Things should work OK if you get the latest files. If not, let me know. Thx -- DrewAdams
