== Emacs as your external editor for Mutt ==

Add the following to your ~/.emacs in order to have all files whose name
contains "/mutt" to be in mail-mode.

    (server-start)
    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("/mutt" . mail-mode))

Change ~/.muttrc:

  set editor=emacsclient
  set pager=emacsclient

You can also use GnuClient instead of EmacsClient, if you installed it.

== XEmacs as your external editor for Mutt ==

Use the same as above, but change your ~/.muttrc to read as follows:

  set editor=gnuclient
  set pager=gnuclient

You need that because XEmacs uses GnuClient instead of EmacsClient.

== Run Mutt within Emacs or XEmacs ==

You can run mutt within an AnsiTerm: M-x ansi-term.

Note that ansi-term remaps your default C-x key to C-c.

== Further Configuration ==

Since your Mutt mails are now in mail-mode, you can use mail-mode-hook for further configurations.  Here is an example to add AutoFillMode:

    (add-hook 'mail-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)

== Replacing C-x # with C-x k ==

This turns on auto-fill-mode, abbrev-mode and sets C-x k to server-edit so that you don't have to change from using C-x k to C-x # depending on the buffer

  (defun my-mail-mode-hook ()
     (auto-fill-mode 1)
     (abbrev-mode 1)
     (local-set-key "\C-Xk" 'server-edit))
   (add-hook 'mail-mode-hook 'my-mail-mode-hook)

== Replacing C-x # with C-c C-c ==

Here's another way which binds C-c C-c and doesn't prompt whether you want to save the buffer first:

  ;; Yes, you can do this same trick with the cool "It's All Text" firefox add-on :-)
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("/mutt-\\|itsalltext.*mail\\.google" . mail-mode))
  (add-hook 'mail-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)
  (add-hook
   'mail-mode-hook
   (lambda ()
     (define-key mail-mode-map [(control c) (control c)]
       (lambda ()
         (interactive)
         (save-buffer)
         (server-edit)))))

== Switching window focus between mutt and emacs when using emacsclient ==

See the [[EmacsClient#WMFocus|"Automatically managing window manager focus" section]] of
EmacsClient.
