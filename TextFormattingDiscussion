== -> Requires Space ==

If you use ##->## followed by a newline, it is not translated into an arrow: ->

A space is required after the arrow to prevent false positives: -> there you go.


== Highlight Formatting ==

[new:DrewAdams:2004-12-24 22:52 UTC]

How about an option for ''highlighting text background''? For example, an RGB code could be used: <code><#E6E6FA>...</#E6E6FA></code> would put the enclosed text on a very pale background. (No nesting of <#> tags allowed.) -- DrewAdams

AlexSchroeder: I would prefer a fixed list of highlighting colors (or just one), so that I can use an em or strong tag from HTML with an appropriate class and style it depending on the style sheet (and still make it usable for text browsers).  What do you think about that?

[Almost a year delay in replying -- didn't notice your reply & question.]

No reason not to have what you suggest, for use with CSS. But why a fixed list of colors? People could specify any colors (in #RGB form) in their CSS files.

And why not have both? Why not let people also put <code><#E6E6FA>...</#E6E6FA></code> tags in the source page. Not as modular and elegant as CSS, but in some ways more flexible. -- DrewAdams

A fixed list would have the benefit of an implementation using CSS classes, and therefore CSS authors could change the colors to adapt to color themes. -- Alex

I see.  That's good too. I was thinking only of people using arbitrary colors in CSS. E.g. -- 

 h1, h2, h3, h4 {
   font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
   color: #369;
   background-color: white;
 }

 h1 {
   font-size: 1.6em;
   font-weight: bold;
   border: solid #cc9;
   border-width: 0px 0px 1px 0px;
   width: 100%;
 }

Or:

 .my-whatever {                  
   background-color:#E6E6FA;            
 }

I'm no CSS expert -- I'll leave it up to you. -- DrewAdams


== Comments ==

May we have comments?  It might be useful to make notes as to why something was done a certian way in a page.

   <!-- has no effect -->

   /* has no effect */

   // has no effect

There is no way to have something on a wiki page and not have it show up on the HTML.
Is there a real need for this?  Why not have meta text coexist with the real text?
-- AlexSchroeder

== OddMuse Wiki syntax vs. HTML ==
Why are you punishing people who know HTML by making us learn another set of tags?  This is not easier.  I would have posted good info here several times, but wading through a new syntactical system is just too much.  What's so hard about, e.g., enclosing text in <xmp>...</xmp>?  (I couldn't find instructions on how to do this in your "new and improved" syntax.) Or <h1>...</h1>?  Yeah, that's a brain-buster.

I find it harder to write correct HTML than any of the various alternatives out there.  Since there are so many alternatives out there, I am not alone in thinking that having to write HTML directly is a big problem. -- AlexSchroeder

[new]
Another problem with allowing people to write unrestricted HTML directly (OddMuse + extensions used here allow for some HTML tags, like &lt;u&gt; and &lt;/u&gt; for <u>underline</u>) is security, among others cross site scripting. Also it would be easier to transform the pages into (invisible) link farms. -- JakubNarebski


== Slightly richer source code ==

The automatic semicolon detection enables the "download" link and syntax highlighting, but makes it impossible to add a category or link to the author's home page.
Any way to have both worlds?
It's OK if the unformatted section must come in the middle and the formatted sections must come at either end.


== Small problems ==

The horizontal-line feature isn't documented as well as it could be -- I only found a passing mention.

I wanted a command name and an apostrophe: ##`undo''s state## but I got a command name and an open quote: `undo''s state
