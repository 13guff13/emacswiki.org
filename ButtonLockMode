Button-lock mode is a minor mode which provides simple facilities to
define clickable text based on regular expressions.  Button-lock
piggybacks on font-lock, and is efficient.

Button-lock buttons (links) can execute any function.

See WikiNavMode for a user-friendly library built on top of button-lock mode.

Both button-lock mode and WikiNavMode are available at github:

Here's a trivial example, showing how to use button-lock to activate hyperlinks
in all buffers:

<pre>
(require 'button-lock)
(global-button-lock-mode 1)
(button-lock-set-global-button "\\<http://[^[:space:]\n]+"
                               'browse-url-at-mouse
                               :face 'link :policy 'prepend)
</pre>

and here's an interesting example, showing how to turn folding-mode delimiters into mouseable buttons:

<pre>
(require 'folding)
(require 'button-lock)

; turn folding-mode delimiters into mouseable buttons
(add-hook 'folding-mode-hook  #'(lambda ()
                                  (button-lock-mode 1)
                                  (button-lock-set-button
                                   (concat "^" (regexp-quote (car (folding-get-mode-marks))))
                                   'folding-toggle-show-hide)
                                  (button-lock-set-button
                                   (concat "^" (regexp-quote (cadr (folding-get-mode-marks))))
                                   'folding-toggle-show-hide)))
</pre>

It is probably more interesting to use button-lock from another library than it is to use button-lock directly.
