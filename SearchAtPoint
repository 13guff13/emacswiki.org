Vim has the mighty `*' and <code>‘#’</code> keys that do an IncrementalSearch for the label under the TextCursor.

So let's say your cursor is in the middle of "anotherVeryLongIdentifier" (like after the first letter "I").

In Emacs using C++-Mode (See CPlusPlusMode) and using CamelCase you would need `M-b M-b M-b M-b C-s C-W C-W C-W C-W C-s' or slightly better <code>‘M-b M-b M-b M-b M-@ C-s M-y C-s’</code> instead of Vim's `*'.

Here are some ways of implementing Vim's `*' and <code>‘#’</code> in Emacs.

== Do it using ISearch ==
C-s C-w, appends the rest of the word under the cursor to the search pattern. So using M-b to return to the beginning of word and C-s C-w emacs searches the next occurance of the word.

== Do it with HighlightSymbol ==

This is a nifty way I found to extend HighlightSymbol to provide this functionality:


  ;; highlight symbol at point and jump to next automatically
  (load-library "highlight-symbol")

  (defun hl-symbol-and-jump ()
    (interactive)
    (let ((symbol (highlight-symbol-get-symbol)))
      (unless symbol (error "No symbol at point"))
      (unless hi-lock-mode (hi-lock-mode 1))
      (if (member symbol highlight-symbol-list)
          (highlight-symbol-next)
        (highlight-symbol-at-point)
        (highlight-symbol-next))))
  (defun hl-symbol-cleanup ()
    (interactive)
    (mapc 'hi-lock-unface-buffer highlight-symbol-list)
    (setq highlight-symbol-list ()))

  (global-set-key (kbd "C-x *") 'hl-symbol-and-jump)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-*") 'hl-symbol-cleanup)

[new]
This shouldn't be necessary.  Just set ''highlight-symbol-on-navigation-p'' and 

  (global-set-key (kbd "C-x *") 'hl-symbol-next)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-*") 'hl-symbol-prev)

-- [[nschum]]

[new]
I guess this should be

  (global-set-key (kbd "C-x *") 'highlight-symbol-next)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-*") 'highlight-symbol-prev)

== Coding entire commands ==

Mimicking this feature of Vim in Emacs can be done in a little EmacsLisp code.

  (require 'etags) ;; provides `find-tag-default' in Emacs 21.
  
  (defun isearch-yank-regexp (regexp)
    "Pull REGEXP into search regexp." 
    (let ((isearch-regexp nil)) ;; Dynamic binding of global.
      (isearch-yank-string regexp))
    (isearch-search-and-update))
  
  (defun isearch-yank-symbol (&optional partialp)
    "Put symbol at current point into search string.
  
  If PARTIALP is non-nil, find all partial matches."
    (interactive "P")
    (let* ((sym (find-tag-default))
	   ;; Use call of `re-search-forward' by `find-tag-default' to
	   ;; retrieve the end point of the symbol.
	   (sym-end (match-end 0))
	   (sym-start (- sym-end (length sym))))
      (if (null sym)
	  (message "No symbol at point")
	(goto-char sym-start)
	;; For consistent behavior, restart Isearch from starting point
	;; (or end point if using `isearch-backward') of symbol.
	(isearch-search)
	(if partialp
	    (isearch-yank-string sym)
	  (isearch-yank-regexp
	   (concat "\\_<" (regexp-quote sym) "\\_>"))))))
  
  (defun isearch-current-symbol (&optional partialp)
    "Incremental search forward with symbol under point.
  
  Prefixed with \\[universal-argument] will find all partial
  matches."
    (interactive "P")
    (let ((start (point)))
      (isearch-forward-regexp nil 1)
      (isearch-yank-symbol partialp)))
  
  (defun isearch-backward-current-symbol (&optional partialp)
    "Incremental search backward with symbol under point.
  
  Prefixed with \\[universal-argument] will find all partial
  matches."
    (interactive "P")
    (let ((start (point)))
      (isearch-backward-regexp nil 1)
      (isearch-yank-symbol partialp)))
  
  (global-set-key [f3] 'isearch-current-symbol)
  (global-set-key [(control f3)] 'isearch-backward-current-symbol)
  
  ;; Subsequent hitting of the keys will increment to the next
  ;; match--duplicating `C-s' and `C-r', respectively.
  (define-key isearch-mode-map [f3] 'isearch-repeat-forward)
  (define-key isearch-mode-map [(control f3)] 'isearch-repeat-backward)

Thanks to JuriLinkov.  The implementation above is from someone who had never used the Vim feature before following only a description of the command written by a Vim user.

== Another implementation of isearch-forward-at-point ==

Seen on http://platypope.org/blog/2007/8/5/a-compendium-of-awesomeness:

    ;; I-search with initial contents
    (defvar isearch-initial-string nil)

    (defun isearch-set-initial-string ()
      (remove-hook 'isearch-mode-hook 'isearch-set-initial-string)
      (setq isearch-string isearch-initial-string)
      (isearch-search-and-update))

    (defun isearch-forward-at-point (&optional regexp-p no-recursive-edit)
      "Interactive search forward for the symbol at point."
      (interactive "P\np")
      (if regexp-p (isearch-forward regexp-p no-recursive-edit)
        (let* ((end (progn (skip-syntax-forward "w_") (point)))
               (begin (progn (skip-syntax-backward "w_") (point))))
          (if (eq begin end)
              (isearch-forward regexp-p no-recursive-edit)
            (setq isearch-initial-string (buffer-substring begin end))
            (add-hook 'isearch-mode-hook 'isearch-set-initial-string)
            (isearch-forward regexp-p no-recursive-edit)))))

== Extending Isearch with isearch-yank-symbol ==

A similar result more in the spirit of Emacs would just extend Isearch's facilities to yank items from the cursor position in the buffer.  For instance, Isearch has a binding for yanking s-expressions from the buffer.  However, an s-expression is a broader definition than the symbol of a common imperative programming language.  The yank needs to be only generic enough for identifiers ("symbols").  `C-M-w' is an obvious binding in Isearch for this "symbol yank".

  (require 'etags)

  (defun isearch-yank-regexp (regexp)
    "Pull REGEXP into search regexp." 
    (let ((isearch-regexp nil)) ;; Dynamic binding of global.
      (isearch-yank-string regexp))
    (if (not isearch-regexp)
	(isearch-toggle-regexp))
    (isearch-search-and-update))

  (defun isearch-yank-symbol ()
    "Put symbol at current point into search string."
    (interactive)
    (let ((sym (find-tag-default)))
      (if (null sym)
	  (message "No symbol at point")
	(isearch-yank-regexp
	 (concat "\\_<" (regexp-quote sym) "\\_>")))))

  (define-key isearch-mode-map "\C-\M-w" 'isearch-yank-symbol)

The command `C-s C-M-w C-s' defined here will search for the entire symbol at the current point.  This shorter implementation than the one above of `isearch-yank-symbol' always uses "word" searches and does not alternatively offer "partial" searches.  A generally useful feature for Isearch's extensibility would allow one to search by yanking the entire thing at a point (see ThingAtPoint) and not only something ''starting'' at point.

== Another take on isearch-yank-symbol using ThingAtPoint ==

Based on JimBlandy's <code>isearch-regexp-whole-symbol</code> (see below)
here is a simpler implementation of <code>isearch-yank-symbol</code> which
also works smoother than the ones above:
{{{
(defun isearch-yank-symbol ()
  "*Put symbol at current point into search string."
  (interactive)
  (let ((sym (symbol-at-point)))
    (if sym
        (progn
          (setq isearch-regexp t
                isearch-string (concat "\\_<" (regexp-quote (symbol-name sym)) "\\_>")
                isearch-message (mapconcat 'isearch-text-char-description isearch-string "")
                isearch-yank-flag t))
      (ding)))
  (isearch-search-and-update))
}}}

== Using ThingAtPoint and the Existing C-s C-w ==

Maybe you only want Vim's `g*' and `g#', (search for "word" under point, as opposed to "\<word\>").
If so, you can simply use `isearch-yank-word-or-char' (called by `C-w' in `isearch-mode') and move at the beginning of word at point on first call:
{{{
;;;
;; Move to beginning of word before yanking word in isearch-mode.
;; Make C-s C-w and C-r C-w act like Vim's g* and g#, keeping Emacs'
;; C-s C-w [C-w] [C-w]... behaviour.

(require 'thingatpt)

(defun my-isearch-yank-word-or-char-from-beginning ()
  "Move to beginning of word before yanking word in isearch-mode."
  (interactive)
  ;; Making this work after a search string is entered by user
  ;; is too hard to do, so work only when search string is empty.
  (if (= 0 (length isearch-string))
      (beginning-of-thing 'word))
  (isearch-yank-word-or-char)
  ;; Revert to 'isearch-yank-word-or-char for subsequent calls
  (substitute-key-definition 'my-isearch-yank-word-or-char-from-beginning 
			     'isearch-yank-word-or-char
			     isearch-mode-map))

(add-hook 'isearch-mode-hook
 (lambda ()
   "Activate my customized Isearch word yank command."
   (substitute-key-definition 'isearch-yank-word-or-char 
			      'my-isearch-yank-word-or-char-from-beginning
			      isearch-mode-map)))
}}} 

== Alternative: search for the current regexp as a whole symbol ==

The  following approach was  implemented by JimBlandy (See
http://www.red-bean.com/pipermail/arcana/2007-February/000011.html):
{{{
(defun isearch-regexp-whole-symbol ()
  "Search for the current regexp as a whole symbol.
You must be in a regexp incremental search for this to work."
  (interactive)
  (if isearch-regexp
      (unless (string-match "^\\\\_<.*\\\\_>" isearch-string)
        (setq isearch-string (concat "\\_<" isearch-string "\\_>")
              isearch-message (mapconcat 'isearch-text-char-description
                                         isearch-string "")
              ;; Don't move cursor in reverse search.
              isearch-yank-flag t))
    (ding))
  (isearch-search-and-update))

(define-key isearch-mode-map "\M-e" 'isearch-regexp-whole-symbol)
}}}

== Another variation that is very vim-like ==

This is meant to closely simulate what Vim does ... match entire words, jump to the first match immediately, etc.

{{{
(defun my-isearch-word-at-point ()
  (interactive)
  (call-interactively 'isearch-forward-regexp))

(defun my-isearch-yank-word-hook ()
  (when (equal this-command 'my-isearch-word-at-point)
    (let ((string (concat "\\<"
                          (buffer-substring-no-properties
                           (progn (skip-syntax-backward "w_") (point))
                           (progn (skip-syntax-forward "w_") (point)))
                          "\\>")))
      (if (and isearch-case-fold-search
               (eq 'not-yanks search-upper-case))
          (setq string (downcase string)))
      (setq isearch-string string
            isearch-message
            (concat isearch-message
                    (mapconcat 'isearch-text-char-description
                               string ""))
            isearch-yank-flag t)
      (isearch-search-and-update))))

(add-hook 'isearch-mode-hook 'my-isearch-yank-word-hook)
}}}

== Shortcuts in ErgoEmacs ==

Users of [[ergoemacs]] can use already predefined shortcuts

* F11 -  highlight-symbol-next, i.e. jump to the next occurrence of the symbol at point
* F12 -  highlight-symbol-prev, i.e. jump to the previous occurrence of the symbol at point

This feature is present in [[ergoemacs]] 1.8.1, and later.
