I maintain a comprehensive [https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d Emacs config for polyglot programmers] which seems to have been adopted by a large number of other people, and I've authored a number of original Elisp packages, including LessCssMode, [https://github.com/purcell/elisp-slime-nav elisp-slime-nav], and [https://github.com/purcell/ibuffer-vc ibuffer-vc].
