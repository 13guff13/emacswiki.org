Artist is an Emacs lisp package that allows you to draw lines,
rectangles, squares, poly-lines, ellipses and circles by using your
mouse and/or keyboard. The shapes are made up with the ascii
characters |, -, / and \.

It is part of Emacs and can also be gotten at
http://www.lysator.liu.se/~tab/artist/.

You will use the mouse for drawing and painting if you are running Emacs in an X-window, as in other graphics programs. But you can also use artist-mode when you are running on a terminal. To see how it works, type:
 M-x artist-mode RET
 C-c C-a p RET
 RET
and move the TextCursor around -- you are drawing a poly-line.

Look at the artist-mode documentation (C-h m RET) for full explanation.

Beta version of xemacs port could be found at Lisp:artist-xmas.el

[new:StefanKamphausen:2004-11-26 10:07 UTC] What exactly is the beta in it?  It seems to work quite well.  One minor issue I noticed is that when you have line numbers turned on via setnu-mode the point where drawing takes place is shifted by the appropriate space to the left of the MousePointer. -- StefanKamphausen

It's beta because it is not checked well. Function artist-mouse-draw-poly still has some problems. I'll try to fix your issue when I have time.

I use [[InteractivelyDoThings]] to change drawing operations and settings:

    ;;; integrate ido with artist-mode
   (defun artist-ido-select-operation (type)
