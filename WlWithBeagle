== How to search (local) Wanderlust folders using Beagle ==

See http://beagle-project.org/ for setting up Beagle to index your mail. If mail is stored in mboxes or maildir it should just work. Add the following to your ##.wl## file:

<pre>
(require 'elmo-search)

(defun elmo-search-split-pattern (engine pattern)
  (split-string pattern "[,]+"))

(elmo-search-register-engine
 'beagle 'local-file
 :prog "beagle-query"
 :args '("--mime" "message/rfc822" "--max-hits" "100000" elmo-search-split-pattern))
</pre>

If you want to search the whole message, remove "--mime" "message/rfc822" from the arguments.

If you wish to, you can add ~/.elmo/cache to the indexed directories (Beagle ignores dot files by default) like:

<pre>
beagle-config indexing AddRoot ~/.elmo/cache/
</pre>

Now, if you make sure that you all IMAP messages are cached, you can search them. (Type ##I## on folders to prefetch them.)

To search for some string "keyword", just go to the special folder "[keyword]" (without quotes).  You can do that by pressing "g" in the Folder or Summary view.

Some useful folders:

<pre>
[mailfrom:sombody]
[mailto:somebody]
[keyword]
[keyword,anotherkeyword]
</pre>
