The official MS-Windows port homepage from gnu.org is
http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/ntemacs.html .
Many issues concerning Emacs and MS-Windows are treated there.
The page has also links to the precompiled binaries for MS-Windows of the current Emacs or earlier versions. 

If you want precompiled binaries for the latest Emacses (version 23.2 is officially released stable; v24 is in early development phase) please see CategoryWThirtyTwo.

Project ntemacs at (http://ntemacs.sourceforge.net/) provides clean, optimized binary builds of the latest Emacs bzr snapshot, with image support enabled and necessary dependencies bundled in the package.
