The official MS-Windows port homepage from gnu.org is
http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/ntemacs.html .
Many issues concerning Emacs and MS-Windows are treated there.
The page has also links to the precompiled binaries for MS-Windows of the current Emacs or earlier versions. 

If you want precompiled binaries for the latest Emacses (version 22.1 is officially released stable; v23 is in early development phase) please see CategoryWThirtyTwo.

(For example there is among several others an unofficial sourceforge project with the latest Win32 builds of emacs at http://ntemacs.sourceforge.net/. As of February 2007 they have 22.X and 23.X builds available.
Unfortunately they do not always update their dates on the wiki page above.)
