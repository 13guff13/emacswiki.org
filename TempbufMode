This package implements tempbuf-mode, a minor mode that enables
buffers to get automatically deleted in the background when it can
be deduced that they are no longer of any use.

It could be common for example to apply this mode to dired-mode buffers
or read-only buffers visiting files, relieving you from having to
delete each of them manually when the buffer list grows too large.

This package is not part of GNU Emacs, and is currently hosted by the EmacsWiki.

Elisp code: Lisp:tempbuf.el.

To enable this mode on dired buffers, put this line in your .emacs:
  (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook 'turn-on-tempbuf-mode)

I find it also very convenient to enable this mode in emacs
customization buffers, W3 (Emacs' Web Browser) buffer, UNIX 'man'
documentation buffers, and any buffer with view-mode activated.

  (add-hook 'custom-mode-hook 'turn-on-tempbuf-mode)
  (add-hook 'w3-mode-hook 'turn-on-tempbuf-mode)
  (add-hook 'Man-mode-hook 'turn-on-tempbuf-mode)
  (add-hook 'view-mode-hook 'turn-on-tempbuf-mode)

Do you know midnight.el in Emacs distribution?
It provides clean-buffer-list function. -- [[rubikitch]]
