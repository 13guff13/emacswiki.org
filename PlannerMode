Planner is a PersonalInformationManager (PIM) by JohnWiegley. You can use it to manage your tasks, schedule, notes,
and anything else you want to store in a free-text richly-hyperlinked personal information manager integrated into
Emacs. Because it's in Emacs, it can easily be tweaked to support your particular way of planning, and it
can draw upon the data and functions you already have in Emacs.

It puts all of the Emacs PIM pieces together: BbdbMode (addresses), EmacsMuse (linking of notes and publishing), etc.  
This allows you to easily write notes, link to other notes, link to dates, link to addresses, link to -- everything.

If you're new to PlannerMode (or you don't mind relearning some keybindings), you can add (planner-install-extra-task-keybindings) to your .emacs to take advantage of the new [http://www.college-paper.org/custom-term-paper.html custom term papers] task keybindings. Warning to old users of planner.el: C-c C-t becomes a prefix key; use C-c C-t C-t to create tasks.

== Planner features ==

Take a look at PlannerModeQuickStart for a number of features and how to use them.  

PlannerMode is a way to manage notes and tasks.  It leverages on EmacsMuse to create a hyperlinked planning and note-taking environment.  Two types of pages are usually created "Daily Pages" and "Project Pages."  Daily pages keep track of the day-to-day; Project pages let you organize your notes into projects.  In the typical set up, tasks and notes can be put into both pages simultaneously, giving you the ability to look over your notes chronologically or by project.  

Here are some features of planner.  Some require customization, so read the docs.

* Task management: Maintain a list of tasks cross-linked between Daily pages and Project pages. 
* Note taking: Create a note in a temporary buffer while in any other emacs buffer.  Choose a Project for the note and it will appear on the Project page and the Daily page.  
* Diary integration: Diary entries can be displayed in the Daily pages.
* Context aware: All the above actions can be made context aware, with hyperlinks back to the context.  Thus a note taken while visiting a gnus email message will have a link back to that message.  A task composed while visiting a buffer will
have a link to the file in the buffer.  PlannerMode helps take the drudgery out of leaving an annotated trail of crumbs for work that you have done.  
* EmacsMuse: All notes can have links to other notes, Project pages, Daily pages, mail messages, bbdb entries, web pages, files on your harddrive.  You can include images.  All the power and simplicity of a wiki language is there as part of your planning package.

== Migrating to Org-Mode ==

A small Perl program to convert Planner files into something suitable for OrgMode [http://gitorious.org/bkuhn-small-hacks/org-mode/blobs/master/planner2org.plx is available].
