This modes allow you to edit compressed files. It uncompresses and
compresses files on the fly, so the user can use compressed files
transparently. To check it out, use `M-x auto-compression-mode' and
open a file compressed with gzip (<code>.gz</code>), bzip2 (<code>.bz2</code>) or compress (<code>.Z</code>).
It's important that you end the filename with one of the above named
extensions, because that's what Emacs uses to recognize that the file's
compressed.

Later, consider adding this to your ~/.emacs file:

    (auto-compression-mode 1)

== dz files ==
<code>.dz</code> files are used by RFC 2229 <code>dictd</code> servers.
(On a [[Debian]] system such files are under <code>/usr/share/dictd</code>.) 
They're gzip format, but arranged to allow random access, ie. direct access to chunks in the middle of the file instead of always reading from the start.

Emacs 22 has support for <code>.dz</code> in auto compression mode, so you can visit a <code>.dict.dz</code> and look at the whole thing instead of doing an actual <code>dict</code> search (see CategoryInterface for <code>dict</code> searches).  You can get the same in Emacs 21 with the following.

    (eval-after-load "jka-compr"
      '(unless (member "\\.dz\\'" (mapcar (lambda (vec) (elt vec 0))
                                          jka-compr-compression-info-list))
         (add-to-list 'jka-compr-compression-info-list
                      ;; this element from emacs 22
                      ["\\.dz\\'"
                       nil              nil     nil
                       "uncompressing"  "gzip"  ("-c" "-q" "-d")
                       nil t "\037\213"])
         ;; if already enabled then toggle to get our addition recognised (note
         ;; no `auto-compression-mode' variable in xemacs 21)
         (when jka-compr-added-to-file-coding-system-alist
           (auto-compression-mode 0)
           (auto-compression-mode 1))))

And <code>.dict</code> files are UTF-8, so

    (modify-coding-system-alist 'file "\\.dict\\'" 'utf-8)
