Hehe...  No description needed here...

This must be the smoothest of all builds:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

See however EmacsCvsAndDebian for more information about other alternatives on Debian and EmacsForLinuxPPC.

== Using stow ==

Here is how to install Emacs using stow:

    ./configure
    make
    make install prefix=/usr/local/stow/emacs
    cd /usr/local/stow
    stow emacs

If you have several installations of Emacs and XEmacs, perhaps some Gnus installation on side as well, then stow will detect conflicts in the info subdirectories.  In order to resolve these, you must delete the appropriate info files.  Example: You have Emacs and a separate Gnus installation.  Then you need to delete the Gnus specific info files from /usr/local/stow/emacs/info.  What I usually do is run stow emacs, delete the offending file, and repeat until all offending files have been deleted.

== Don't have X installed on your GNU/Linux? ==
You must have some of the Xlib libraries available, even when you do not use X. On Debian, this is the xlibs-devel package.

For a fully featured Emacs, you need the following libraries (on a single line for use in commands):

libc6-dev libjpeg62-dev libncurses5-dev libpng-dev libtiff4-dev libungif4-dev xaw3dg-dev zlib1g-dev libice-dev libsm-dev libx11-dev libxext-dev libxi-dev libxmu-dev libxmuu-dev libxpm-dev libxrandr-dev libxt-dev libxtrap-dev libxtst-dev libxv-dev x-dev xlibs-static-dev

On Debian Woody (thanks to MilesBader) that list should be:

libc6-dev libjpeg62-dev libncurses5-dev libpng-dev libtiff3g-dev libungif4-dev xaw3dg-dev zlib1g-dev xlibs-dev

== Tools Required ==

If you're getting errors of the form "Unknown command: copying" while running texinfo, you need to install texinfo 4.2 or later.

You might also need /usr/sbin on your PATH, so that the Makefile can find "install-info".
