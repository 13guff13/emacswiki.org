GnusNotify is a mode that display gnus news number at mode-line. Combined with [[GnusDemon]], it warns you when you receive new mails or when there are new news to read.

There are two variants (see comparison below). One of them is called gnus-notify+.
You can get it from [[gnus-notify+.el]].

The original, older one, is at [[gnus-notify.el]]. It has different albeit still useful features.

There are even more alternatives, see GnusNotificationComparison.

==How to use gnus-notify.el==
gnus-notify allows you to select which groups you want to include in the report; it does this via a „group parameter“ you have to add manually.

To do it: use ##G p## in the group buffer, then add ##(modeline-notify t)## to the list there; if it were the only property, it would look like this: ##((modeline-notify t))##

==Comparison and which one to choose==
* gnus-notify allows you to select which groups you want to include in the report; see above for how
* gnus-notify+ works with a timer, and each time it runs it slows down your Emacs for a moment
* gnus-notify+ shows only a total count of unread messages, whereas gnus-notify shows the group names which contain unread messages but doesn't tell you how many
