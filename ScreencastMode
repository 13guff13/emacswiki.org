This is a mode for creating your own screencasts, to be displayed inside Emacs.

* Download: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/screencast.el

The file is self-documenting just load it, and type

M-x screencast-screencast-producer

M-x screencast-screencast-user

Most screencasts are based on the info-page or describe-mode. 

A reasonable question is: why not read the info-page, which
contains more details, instead?

I have three answers:

* some people finds it easier to watch movies than read static text.

* screencast-mode '''displays''' the capabilities of a mode,
  instead of '''describing''' them.

* those who just need to know '''how''' to use a mode doesn't
  need all the details of the info-page.

If videos are superior in some way, why not just create a
regular video displaying someone doing the things then?

I have three answers again:

* a video is static, it's hard to change it if you discover
  an error - you'll have to do it in one take unless you got
  some video editing software.

* the screencast sources can be edited by others, inviting
  collaboration (also it's a lot smaller size-wise)

* the screencast will tell the user if his Emacs is
  configured right to use the feature it explains

A list of screencasts is available at ScreencastSources

-----

You can save the screencast as a movie for some video
service (you-tube etc.)  using ScreencastRecord. 

The recorded screencasts are listed at ScreencastRecordings.

EmacsScreencasts contains a list of screencasts about Emacs
made without screencast-mode.
