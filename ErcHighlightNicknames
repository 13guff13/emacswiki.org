This module highlights nicknames in ERC. It uses the first
twelve digits of the MD5 message digest of the nickname as color (#rrrrggggbbbb).

== Download ==
Lisp:erc-highlight-nicknames.el

== Usage ==
To activate this module, put this in your init file:

<pre>
    (require 'erc-highlight-nicknames)
</pre>

and add highlight-nicknames to ##`erc-modules'## by customizing it.

Or put this in your init file

<pre>
    (and
     (require 'erc-highlight-nicknames)
     (add-to-list 'erc-modules 'highlight-nicknames)
     (erc-update-modules))
</pre>

If you don't just want the nicks colored, but also some other face properties, you can customize ##`erc-highlight-nick-base-face'## and for example inherit from the face ##`bold'## or ##`underline'##.

<pre>
    M-x customize-face RET erc-highlight-nick-base-face RET
</pre>

== XEmacs Usage ==

I tried this in XEmacs and it didn't work, due to differences in the way Emacs and XEmacs handle text attributes.  I modified erc-nighlight-nicknames to work with XEmacs faces instead.  See Lisp:erc-highlight-nicknames-xemacs.el.  -- DaveMarquardt

[new]
I made the changes with your code and it works for Emacs too. Plus a new face every nick's face is inherited from. (customizable, see description above) -- AndreRiemann


== Fix face bug ==
I found function `erc-highlight-nicknames' have a bug that create many face to make Emacs slow, even crash.
It create a new face when ERC insert text, and don't care whether have a exist face for this nickname.

I add a hash-table named `erc-highlight-face-table' to storage the nick's face.
Just create a new face when occur new nick, if find a old nick, get face from `erc-highlight-face-tabe' instead of create new one.      

And i have upload a new version, enjoy!                 -- AndyStewart
