Recent version of ESS integrates out of the box with [[http://cx4a.org/software/auto-complete/ auto-complete]] package.

Three sources `ac-source-R-args', `ac-source-R-objects' and `ac-source-R' are included in ESS distribution. The latest combines previous two and makes them play nicely together.

== Initialization ==

The easiest way to initialize:

{{{
(setq ess-use-auto-complete t)
}}}

This activates 'ac-source-R in both ESS and iESS buffers. If you want AC only in your ESS buffers do:

{{{
(setq ess-use-auto-complete 'script-only)
}}}

== Quick help ==

ESS provides AC help both for arguments and objects (default keys: `C-?` or `<f1>`)

You can bind `M-h` to display quick help pop-ups as in screen-shots above (requires a fairly recent version of AC https://github.com/m2ym/auto-complete):

{{{
(define-key ac-completing-map (kbd "M-h") 'ac-quick-help)

}}}

== Movement keys ==

Ac binds M-n, and M-p for navigation in the completion menu, which might be inconvenient if you want it to use in the inferior R. Bind it to something else:

{{{
(define-key ac-completing-map "\M-n" nil) ;; was ac-next
(define-key ac-completing-map "\M-p" nil) ;; was ac-previous
(define-key ac-completing-map "\M-," 'ac-next)
(define-key ac-completing-map "\M-k" 'ac-previous)
}}}

== Colors ==

Example of dark config as in  the snapshot:

{{{
(set-face-attribute 'ac-candidate-face nil   :background "#00222c" :foreground "light gray")
(set-face-attribute 'ac-selection-face nil   :background "SteelBlue4" :foreground "white")
(set-face-attribute 'popup-tip-face    nil   :background "#003A4E" :foreground "light gray")
}}}

== Misc customization ==

You can play with [[http://cx4a.org/software/auto-complete/manual.html#Configuration AC settings]] to adjust the completion to your needs:

{{{

(setq 
      ;; ac-auto-show-menu 1
      ;; ac-candidate-limit nil
      ;; ac-delay 0.1
      ;; ac-disable-faces (quote (font-lock-comment-face font-lock-doc-face))
      ;; ac-ignore-case 'smart
      ;; ac-menu-height 10
      ;; ac-quick-help-delay 1.5
      ;; ac-quick-help-prefer-pos-tip t
      ;; ac-use-quick-help nil
)
}}}
