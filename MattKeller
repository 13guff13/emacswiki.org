= Matt Keller = 

I use Emacs on Linux. I am a former vimmer who initially moved to Emacs to hack Common Lisp. 

For the dot-file peepers, I keep my emacs configuration in a [http://www.littleredbat.net/mk/cgi-bin/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=elisp.git;a=blob;f=dotemacs;hb=HEAD public git repository].

== mk-project.el ==

I've recently written a library called mk-project.el to manage emacs "projects" (see [[CategoryProgrammerUtils#ProjectSupport]]). 

Details are on the [http://www.littleredbat.net/mk/code/mk-project.html mk-project.el homepage]; see Lisp:mk-project.el for the source.
