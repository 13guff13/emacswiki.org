[[http://nodejs.org/|Node-JS]] is an asynchronous TCP programming framework using JavaScript.

There is a [[https://github.com/abicky/nodejs-mode.el|node.js mode]]. As of 2013-04-15 it has not been updated for Node.js 0.8 or later.
[new:OtherMichael:2013-04-28 19:59 UTC]Question: But does it still work with newer versions of node.js ?

<pre>
The simplest way to have node.js (tested using node v0.8.1) as an inferior shell under Emacs is to use the js-comint package. Then, set (setq inferior-js-program-command "node --interactive") to force node to run in interactive mode. The command M-x run-js will then open the interpreter.

Also working on Win7, Emacs 24 and node.js 0.10.5
