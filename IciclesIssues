== Icicles Issues ==

This page is a dispatch page for discussion of ''issues'' you might have with library '''<tt>[[icicles.el]]</tt>''' ('''[[Icicles]]'''), including bugs.


* '''IciclesIssuesOpen''' -- Issues that are not yet fixed. Describe your problem here.

* IciclesIssuesStale -- Issues that users did not follow up on -- never heard back from them. Could mean that the problem is not a problem; could mean that they gave up ;-).

* IciclesIssuesClosed -- Issues that were resolved. Bugs that were fixed. Explanations of non-bugs. Issues from IciclesIssuesOpen and IciclesIssuesStale are moved here when they are resolved.

For general discussion about the library, feedback, possible uses, and possible enhancements, see '''IciclesDiscussion'''.  (For discussion of library '''<tt>[[lacarte.el]]</tt>''', see LaCarte.)


== How To Report an Icicles Bug ==

You can report an '''Icicles''' bug at '''IciclesIssuesOpen''' -- please follow the formatting suggestion provided there.

Alternatively, you can report an '''Icicles''' bug by email, but in that case others will not share in the discussion. To report by email, do ''one'' of the following:

* Choose item '''Send Bug Report''' from MenuBar menu '''Icicles'''
* `##M-x icicle-send-bug-report##'
* (1) `C-h' from the minibuffer; (2) click button '''Icicles Options and Faces''' in buffer `*Help*'; (3) click link `##Send Bug Report##' in buffer `##*Customize Group: icicles*##'

Always mention your Emacs version and platform (e.g. Windows, GNU/Linux). If you aren't using the latest '''Icicles''' files, let me know which you are using. '''Icicles''' files each have an <code>Update #</code> field in the header, which identifies the file exactly.


== Debugging Tips ==

1. If you use the debugger to report a backtrace, first delete all '''Icicles''' byte-compiled files, so that you use only the source files (##icicles*.el##) for debugging.

2. By default, in ''Icicle'' mode, `M-x' is bound to command '''`icicle-execute-extended-command''''. This is a multi-command, which presents certain advantages over the standard command bound to `M-x' in Emacs, `execute-extended-command' -- see [[Icicles - Multi M-x]] for details.

However, `icicle-execute-extended-command' has one disadvantage: an error backtrace is less informative, which can make debugging more difficult. If you want to see a normal backtrace at the point of error, then do what I do:

  M-: (define-key icicle-mode-map "\M-x" 'execute-extended-command)
  M-x set-variable debug-on-error t
