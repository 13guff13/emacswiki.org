[http://www.darcs.net/ Darcs] (David's Advanced Revision Control
System) is yet another DVC (Distributed Version Control) system featuring
both decentralization and ease of learning and use.

Darcs's author is David Roundy and it is written in Haskell.  It is
GPLed and is known to work on GNU/linux, !MacOS X, !FreeBSD, and
Microsoft Windows (both natively or through Cygwin) platforms.  It is
patch-based, using an interesting theory of patches which contributes
to some of its still unique (but influential)
[http://darcs.net/manual/node2.html features], although these don't
all map well onto support in Emacs.  It is often considered the
easiest DVCS to use, even for non-experts.

You can contact Darcs people on #darcs at irc://irc.freenode.net (if the
channel is too quiet, try at #emacs at irc://irc.freenode.net).

==Darcs modes==

=== VC-based ===

There are two VC implementations for Darcs available at
* http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~jch/software/repos/vc-darcs/ and
* http://www.loveshack.ukfsn.org/emacs/vc-darcs.el.

They seem to differ particularly in how they treat "revisions" for VC.
The raison d'Ãªtre of the latter is copyright assignment to the FSF, so
it is the one to contribute to if you want to try to get support into
Emacs.

VC intrinsically still doesn't seem to support systems like Darcs
properly (and changes to generalize it have been rejected).

=== Not VC-based ===

* [http://joyful.com/repos/darcsum darcsum] ([http://joyful.com/darcsweb/darcsweb.cgi?r=darcsum browse repo]) is a vaguely
  PCL-CVS-like interface which allows you to select individual hunks
  to record, for instance.  See
  [http://xtalk.msk.su/~ott/en/writings/emacs-vcs/EmacsDarcs.html],
  for example.

* [http://chumsley.org/download/xdarcs.el xdarcs] is "inspired by
  ... darcsum.el".

* There is some support for Darcs in [DistributedVersionControl
  DVC], but Darcs doesn't seem to be supported properly yet.

* [http://fresh.homeunix.net/~luke/repos/darcs-mode/ darcs.el] is old
  code that doesn't seem to add anything significant over darcsum
  and/or VC.
