Most people learn best by doing and not just by reading over a list of
[[command]]s and trying to memorize them.  Get yourself a text file
to play around with. Make a backup copy if you're nervous about
losing it. But don't worry -- Emacs makes it
hard to lose your work, and it has a great undo command: `##C-/##' or `##C-_##'.

Emacs [[key binding]]s can be intimidating at first since they are quite
distinct from those used in other applications and platforms.  Keep
the following advice in mind.

# Try to memorize the most commonly used commands in the tutorial.

# Use [[AproposMode|apropos]] or [[SelfDocumentation|help]] to find commands to accomplish a task.

# Run the command for a task with `M-x' and typing it in.

# Run the command again by using `M-x M-p' or by typing it in again.

# On the third time, see if the command is bound to a key binding with
`C-h w'.

# If you forget a key binding (sometimes you forget even the basic
keys introduced in the tutorial), try `C-h w M-p' to peek at it
again or use `C-h b' to browse the bindings available in the current [[buffer]].

# If you can't burn a key binding into your brain with this approach,
then you might not be using it enough to matter.  Don't worry about it.

# If you're convinced after a fair amount of practice that a given key binding is really bad, then consider binding its command to a different, unused key.  But not before.

Some [[EmacsNewbie]]s rush too quickly to add or change key bindings.  This can mean
avoiding to learn Emacs and spending more time configuring.
Competency with `M-x' and help are core Emacs skills for
life.  `M-x' should become your command line in Emacs.



== Emacs-Lisp Libraries and Snippets that Can Help You Learn Emacs ==

* Use [[EmacsNewbieWithIcicles|Icicles]] to explore [[key]]s, commands, variables, [[face]]s, [[buffer]]s, files, [[property list]]s,... that match a given pattern (name or [[regexp]]). Far more than AproposMode.

* Use LaCarte to more easily explore Emacs menus.

* Use the improved menu bar provided by [[HelpMenuBarPlus|MenuBarPlus]].

* Use the improved Emacs help provided by HelpPlus.

* Enable a random TipOfTheDay.

* Play the game KeyWiz to learn Emacs key bindings. (This works for ViperMode key bindings too.)
