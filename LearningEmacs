This page provides tips for learning to use Emacs and learning more about Emacs. See also '''EmacsNewbie'''.

Try the EmacsTutorial, or read one of the BooksAboutEmacs.

Most people learn best by doing and not just by reading over a list of
[[command]]s and trying to memorize them.  Get yourself a text file
to play around with. Make a backup copy if you're nervous about
losing it. But don't worry -- Emacs makes it
hard to lose your work, and it has a great undo command: `##C-/##' or `##C-_##'.

* Learn using Emacs's SelfDocumentation.

* Learn with Emacs's AproposMode.

* Read the EmacsManual in InfoMode (hypertext form).

* Learn Emacs while you LearnEmacsLisp.

* Watch EmacsScreencasts of how experienced users use Emacs.

* Use LaCarte to more easily explore Emacs menus.

* Use the improved menu bar provided by [[HelpMenuBarPlus|MenuBarPlus]].

* Use the improved Emacs help provided by HelpPlus.
