Short messages to the user appear commonly in the '''[::echo area]'''. This area is shared with the [[minibuffer]]. The space occupied by the minibuffer for input is thus also used by the echo area for output. There are two names for this space because the behavior is different. The minibuffer is used for input; the echo area is used for output. Because it is used only for output, the echo area is read-only.

The echo area is not a [[buffer]] -- you cannot edit anything there. It is simply a space for displaying messages. Most text written to the echo area is also logged to the MessagesBuffer.

When you type input into the minibuffer, and you pause for a short time, a reminder or prompt message is sometimes output temporarily, as feedback, to the echo area. The most common use of this is to ''echo the keystrokes'' you type, if you type them slowly enough. User option `echo-keystrokes' determines how long to wait before echoing, if there is not yet any follow-up input.

The echo area is also used for other informative messages -- those displayed by function `message', for instance. Output to the echo area (except for echoed keystrokes, in GnuEmacs), is also logged to the MessagesBuffer, `*Messages*'.

Is there a way to clear the echo area of echoed keystrokes when a command is finished? -- VegardOye
