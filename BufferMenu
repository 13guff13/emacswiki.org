The buffer menu presents a list of buffers. It is similar to how DiredMode operates with files.  Command `M-x buffer-menu' lists the buffers in the current window. This is an alternative to ListBuffers.


According to the EmacsManual:

: ''The "buffer menu" opened by `C-x C-b' (List Buffers) does
not merely list buffers.  It also allows you to perform various
operations on buffers, through an interface similar to Dired. You can save buffers, kill them (here called "deleting"
them, for consistency with Dired), or display them.''

: ''To use the buffer menu, type `C-x C-b' and switch to the window displaying the `##*Buffer List*##' buffer.  You can also type `M-x buffer-menu' to open the buffer menu in the selected window.  Alternatively, the command `M-x buffer-menu-other-window' opens the buffer menu in another window, and selects that window.''

Use ‘##?##’ (or `C-h m', as always) in the `##*Buffer List*##' window for more information about possible operations on the buffers listed.



To bind `C-x C-b' to command `buffer-menu':

  (global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-b") 'buffer-menu)


The relation between `list-buffers' and `buffer-menu' is a bit like that between `list-directories' (`C-x C-d') and `dired' (`C-x d'): one is for listing, the other is for listing and manipulating.  However, you can just select the window displayed by `list-buffers', to act on its listed buffers.
