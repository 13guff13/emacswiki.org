: Welcome! -- AlexSchroeder

Waoow. nice editing conflicts...Have you seen that I had also added a solution
for the modeline (1 minute before you) and btw completely reformated the page? 
Use show revisions to see the modified page.

Did the script told you about editing conflict or you didn't notice anything?

Note that I am just trying to know what happened and I'm not criticizing you. --PierreGaston

Note that Oddmuse uses the `merge' tool (the same mechanism CVS uses to resolve conflicts).
Therefore, if `merge' thinks it can resolve the conflict, the user is not warned about the conflict.

Yes, but I had  made a lot of changes to the page and the version of myrkraverk (version 7)
is like the version 5 with an addition, throwing out all my changes.
That's why I wanted to know if he had just ignore an edit conflict message or if 
there is a problem with the script. -- PierreGaston

Interesting, I was not aware of this discussion until now ;)  -- MyrkraVerk [23-08-2003]
