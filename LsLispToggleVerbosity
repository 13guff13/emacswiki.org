when used in dired, ls-lisp shows normally lots of status info per file in front of the file name which sometimes makes reading the file name cumbersome.

in order to gain more real estate for the file name it can be useful to switch off user and group info. i have written a little function which toggles this info on and off with the necessary redraw:


    (defun leo-toggle-ls-lisp-verbosity ()
      (interactive)
      (if (memq 'uid ls-lisp-verbosity)
          (progn
            (setq ls-lisp-verbosity (delq 'uid ls-lisp-verbosity))
            (setq ls-lisp-verbosity (delq 'gid ls-lisp-verbosity))
            (revert-buffer)
            (message "uid & gid hidden"))
        (progn
          (add-to-list 'ls-lisp-verbosity 'uid)
          (add-to-list 'ls-lisp-verbosity 'gid)
          (revert-buffer)
          (message "uid & gid visible"))))


    
i have bound it to C-p in dired mode:


    (add-hook 'dired-load-hook
       (lambda ()
         (define-key dired-mode-map "\C-p" 
                            'leo-toggle-ls-lisp-verbosity)))
</code>
