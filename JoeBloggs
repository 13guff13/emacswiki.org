I use Emacs.. alot.

Here are some libraries I wrote:

==Elisp libraries==
Note to self: put some of these on elpa/melpa/marmalade

* '''Lisp:sms.el''' -- compose text (SMS) messages 
* '''Lisp:bbdb-sms.el''' -- integration of [[BBDB]] with [[sms.el]]
* '''Lisp:erc-babel.el''' -- automatic translation of IRC messages between different (spoken) languages
* '''Lisp:bs-ext.el''' -- extensions to Buffer Selection mode
* '''Lisp:simple-call-tree+.el''' -- programming aid for navigating call trees
* '''Lisp:one-key.el''' -- see below
* '''Lisp:one-key-dir.el''' -- fast directory navigation and file browser using [[OneKey]]
* '''Lisp:one-key-yas.el''' -- [[OneKey]] menu for [[Yasnippet]]
* '''Lisp:one-key-bmkp.el''' -- [[OneKey]] menu for [[BookmarkPlus]]

==One-Key==
I am the current maintainer for [[OneKey]] (Lisp:one-key.el), [[LazySearch]] (Lisp:lazy-search.el), and Lisp:lazy-search-extension.el written by [[AndyStewart]] and [[rubikitch]].
I have also written the following extension for [[OneKey]]:

* '''Lisp:one-key-dir.el''' -- navigate directories using [[OneKey]]

==EmacsConf==

I will be attending [[http://emacswiki.org/emacs/Emacs_Conference_2013 EmacsConf]] on 30th March 2013.
I will update this page with a note about what I am wearing in case anyone wants to find me to chat about OneKey at the conference.
