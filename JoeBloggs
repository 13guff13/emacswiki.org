I use Emacs.. alot.

Here are some libraries I wrote:

==My elisp libraries==

* '''Lisp:sms.el''' -- compose text (SMS) messages 
* '''Lisp:bbdb-sms.el''' -- integration of [[BBDB]] with [[sms.el]]
* '''Lisp:erc-babel.el''' -- automatic translation of IRC messages between different (spoken) languages

Using [[OneKey]] library, I have a problem in assigning, for example, ‘mark-paragraph’ function to a key, namely typing the OneKey keybinding results in the paragraph not marked. While using ‘M-x mark-paragraph’ it works properly! Any idea what is wrong? -- SewerynKokot
