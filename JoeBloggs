Using [[OneKey]] library, I have a problem in assigning, for example, ‘mark-paragraph’ function to a key, namely typing the OneKey keybinding results in the paragraph not marked. While using ‘M-x mark-paragraph’ it works properly! Any idea what is wrong? -- SewerynKokot

Actually I think the paragraph IS being marked (I tried it), but the coloured overlay is not being applied.
Try C-w just after applying mark-paragraph and I think you will see the paragraph disappear.
Not sure why the coloured overlay is not applied though :(
