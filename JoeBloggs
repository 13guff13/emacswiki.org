I use Emacs.. alot.

Here are some libraries I wrote:

==Elisp libraries==

* '''Lisp:sms.el''' -- compose text (SMS) messages 
* '''Lisp:bbdb-sms.el''' -- integration of [[BBDB]] with [[sms.el]]
* '''Lisp:erc-babel.el''' -- automatic translation of IRC messages between different (spoken) languages

==One-Key==
I am the current maintainer for [[OneKey]] and [[LazySearch]] written by [[AndyStewart]] and [[rubikitch]].
I have also written the following extension for [[OneKey]]:

* '''Lisp:one-key-dir.el''' -- navigate directories using [[OneKey]]

: Hi Joe, there have Lisp:lazy-search-extension.el, do you want take over it too? -- AndyStewart

Using [[OneKey]] library, I have a problem in assigning, for example, ‘mark-paragraph’ function to a key, namely typing the OneKey keybinding results in the paragraph not marked. While using ‘M-x mark-paragraph’ it works properly! Any idea what is wrong? -- SewerynKokot

Actually I think the paragraph IS being marked (I tried it), but the coloured overlay is not being applied.
Try C-w just after applying mark-paragraph and I think you will see the paragraph disappear.
Not sure why the coloured overlay is not applied though :(
