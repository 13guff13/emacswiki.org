I use Emacs.. alot.

Here are some libraries I wrote:

==Elisp libraries==
Note to self: put some of these on elpa/melpa/marmalade

* '''Lisp:sms.el''' -- compose text (SMS) messages 
* '''Lisp:bbdb-sms.el''' -- integration of [[BBDB]] with [[sms.el]]
* '''Lisp:erc-babel.el''' -- automatic translation of IRC messages between different (spoken) languages
* '''Lisp:bs-ext.el''' -- extensions to Buffer Selection mode
* '''Lisp:simple-call-tree+.el''' -- programming aid for navigating call trees
* '''Lisp:one-key.el''' -- see below
* '''Lisp:one-key-dir.el''' -- fast directory navigation and file browser using [[OneKey]]
* '''Lisp:one-key-yas.el''' -- [[OneKey]] menu for [[Yasnippet]]
* '''Lisp:one-key-bmkp.el''' -- [[OneKey]] menu for [[BookmarkPlus]]

==One-Key==
I am the current maintainer for [[OneKey]] (Lisp:one-key.el), [[LazySearch]] (Lisp:lazy-search.el), and Lisp:lazy-search-extension.el written by [[AndyStewart]] and [[rubikitch]].
I have also written the following extension for [[OneKey]]:

* '''Lisp:one-key-dir.el''' -- navigate directories using [[OneKey]]

Using [[OneKey]] library, I have a problem in assigning, for example, âmark-paragraphâ function to a key, namely typing the OneKey keybinding results in the paragraph not marked. While using âM-x mark-paragraphâ it works properly! Any idea what is wrong? -- SewerynKokot

Actually I think the paragraph IS being marked (I tried it), but the coloured overlay is not being applied.
Try C-w just after applying mark-paragraph and I think you will see the paragraph disappear.
Not sure why the coloured overlay is not applied though :(

==EmacsConf==

I will be attending [[http://emacswiki.org/emacs/Emacs_Conference_2013 EmacsConf]] on 30th March 2013.
If anyone wants to chat with me about OneKey or any other library of mine look out for the guy in dark blue jeans and top, balding , stubble, with a blue and white bike courier shoulder bag.
