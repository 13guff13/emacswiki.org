iew that the IRB appeal is jutified?Andy replied ... Good question. I haven't had a chance to see yet, to be honest. We'll see more in tomorrow's papers. The news broke late in the day on Thursday, and then Horwill faced questions about it at his press conference at 8.30am this morning. Since then I've been busy working. But this morning the mood, in the main, seemed quite aggressive actually. There are always one or two one-eyed old journos who will be on his side, but I get the impression that some of the harder, younger blokes are sniffing blood in the water around this Wallaby team, what with Robbie Deans being a dead man walking, and Kurtley Beale being always in and out of trouble, and they quite fancy taking a few bites out of them.They are certainly irritated that the IRB have taken this step. There were calls this morning for all the other eight camera angles used in the citing case to be made available so that we can all make our own minds up.shornofthedead asked ... What do the Aussies make of the Lions? Are they nervous for tomorrow? Is the press being mean? More importantly what does it mean when the Australian soccer (sic) players are the most successful international team from our antipodean cousins? My guess is end of days.Andy rep

 graduates are over three-quarters less likely to be employed than their white peers. And while Goodhart acknowledges the results ofthe so-called "CV tests", revealing that employers are still less likely toemploy applicants with ethnic minority names, he justifies the discrepancy on the grounds that suchpeople might prove "a source oftension and embarrassment" in the workplace, as,after all, "people will generally givepreference to, and feel more comfortable being around, people they are familiar with". Acting on such attitudes as an employer has,of course, been illegal since the passage of the 1968 Race Relations Act.Trying to stop the passage of that actwas the main target of Powell's notorious speech. In Goodhart's description of a subsequent decade "which has gone into radical and minority folklore", there are a number of small but significant errors: the National Front saved their West Bromwich byelection deposit in 1973 not 1976 (and thus under a Tory not a Labour government), and although theNF never won a council seat, the break-away National party won two, inBlackburn.But the main absentee is the immigrant community itself. True, Goodhart lists some Asian groups and mentions the 1963 Bristol bus boycott and the 1976 Grunwick picket line (

 al fixture against Blackburn in December. It really is the taking part that counts. JS Bradford City's Peter Beagrie celebrates his penalty which put his side ahead against Wimbledon. Photograph: John Giles/PA Archive/Press Association Ima5) Bradford 3-0 Wimbledon, Premier League, 30 April 2000The Crazy Gang had never been part of the establishment, but they were increasingly part of the furniture. Wimbledon had been a top-flight side for 14 years and, despite their eccentric Norwegian manager Egil Olsen's long-ball methods not appealing to many outside the Charles Hughes Appreciation Society, it looked like being business as usual during the 1999-2000 Premier League season. But then the Dons plunged into a dramatic death-spiral, losing seven games on the trot. Bradford's record was scarcely better, but when they surprised seventh-placed Sunderland at the Stadium of Light on 24 April they suddenly had a shot at survival.With three games remaining Watford were down and Sheffield Wednesday were as good as relegated 锟紺 with the final place between Wimbledon, on 32 points, and Bradford on 30 points. Everything was set for a dramatic Sunday afternoon showdown at Valley Parade. And it was certainly dramatic.Rarely has a result in Premier League history

 ess and relevance, and also urgency 锟紺 but you don't need to do that through publishing what happened incrementally at 11 o'clock last night in London. It's about sheer good reporting or providing under-reported material, and display can convey urgency."While the web is very much the first draft of history, a rough-cut, it still has to be good journalism, well-sourced, reliable. Clearly, the printed form is going to have more effort put into it, going to be more reflective and relevant."Then he comes up with what he calls "a pretty revolutionary thought" by asking: "Why can't you have a page ready almost 18 hours ahead? Very soon this year, I'm going to be saying to executives on a Tuesday, 'what have you got for Thursday?'"But you know something, it can be done. By using our international network, utilising templates and thinking ahead with pre-planned pages that contain carefully selected relevant news, we can deliver stories that other people just don't have. And that will release resources for the web."As for the web, he reveals that the paper will launch an innovation called Fast FT later this year. It will be composed of "short, sharp, informed takes on market-breaking news or market developments". And an FT Weekend app is being planned too.
