iest decision was to send the task force to the south Atlantic to take the Falklands back from the Argentinians. That was certainly high in peril. Had General Galtieri's airforce been more proficient 锟紺 had it managed to sink the aircraft carrier 锟紺 it could have ended in a colossal humiliation for Britain. But for her, it was not so much a gamble as unavoidable. The alternative was resignation.Only after her landslide victory of 1983 against a divided left did Thatcherism really take flight. The top rate of tax was slashed to 40%. The privatisation of state industries was a world-leading revolution. But it did not really lead to the "share-owning democracy" that she aspired to create. Most of the "Sids" quickly pocketed their profits and the bulk of the shares ended up in the hands of financial institutions. Something had to be done about the failing state industries, but it is arguable that there were better answers than turning them into virtual private monopolies supervised by anonymous regulators. It was also in her second term that she finally felt strong enough for the epic confrontation with the miners that shattered them and broke union power more generally. The unions had effectively destroyed the premierships of two of her recent predece

 he might just be content, not seeing the evil hidden in bright sunlight? "No, not now. I used to be able to do that. I could imagine a Mississippi where I was content, and Icould imagine a California where I was content. I can't now, no. Especially not after having a child."Despite the self-identification as an addict, it was only after becoming a father that Murry actually became one. He underwent surgery for a muscle disorder: "They took a piece of muscle tissue and they gave me painkillers and there was this warm glow that washed over." It was a feeling he wanted to replicate after the prescription was finished. "Ijust couldn't stop. I just kept going and it quickly grew into a full-blown heroinaddiction."His wife and child left him (they are now reconciled). He overdosed and nearly died. The event is the subject of The Graceless Age's astonishing centrepiece, Little Colored Balloons. And the ecstatic reaction to that song at his gigs causes him concern. "We praise it as a culture 锟紺 this leaning towards self-destruction 锟紺 because we all want it. We want it badly. We want to believe the rock'n'roll myth exists and somewhere in the world people are getting to behave in a way we can't." He wonders, too, if people aren't praising the record a l

 rs then split into two groups, one going to the main gas plant, the other heading for the living quarters two miles away.Abdelkader, an Algerian BP employee in his 40s, was at a guard post when a jeep with seven people inside smashed through the barrier and came to a sudden halt. He said the gunmen got out of the vehicle, ordered the guards not to move, took their mobile phones and disabled security cameras.Abdelkader told reporters that one gunman told him: "You are Algerians and Muslims, you have nothing to fear. We're looking for Christians, who kill our brothers in Mali and Afghanistan and plunder our resources." He said the militants shot one of the guards in the foot and led the others inside the plant. Abdelkader said he was freed after telling the gunmen he was a father of four.His account is one of several that suggest the attackers were extremely well informed about the plant's layout. According to Riad, an employee of Japanese engineering company JGC, the jihadists appeared to know camp procedures and the sections of the living quarters run by BP and JGC, where most of the foreigners lived, even those foreigners' room numbers. "They had accomplices on the inside," said Riad.He described how the Japanese workers were then hunted down and

 ifference?Oh yeah, absolutely, because if Mitt Romney had won, first of all he would have cut off all federal funding. Obama gives $500m a year to Planned Parenthood. If Mitt Romney had won he would have cut those off and the money sent overseas, and I think, even more importantly, the next supreme court justice will be appointed by Obama.Initially he was pro-abortion but he genuinely had a conversion and changed stance and from that time on he has been pro-life, so he would have followed through with it because that's what he had stood for in the past.Was it scary up the tree?I didn't go up that high at first, but then they brought a ladder. When they brought a ladder the crowd started cheering, like "Yeah, get him out of the tree!" I knew if i hadn't have gone higher they would have come after me so I had to climb. When the wind blew it kind of swayed and that got a little bit nervous but overall the lord was with me, I was up there for five hours, so I was fine.Will this deter you? Do you have any other protests lined up?I can't preach anywhere in DC, so when I go to court on the 25th, in front of the courthouse. That's really the only place I can be legally. I plan to open-air preach, and I preach pretty loud. I plan to preach before I go into
