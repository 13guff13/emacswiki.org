Buffer-Ring

Developed by [[codermattie]]

Buffer Ring creates rings of buffers. Cycling within a buffer-ring switches to the next
buffer in the ring until it wraps around. It does not use the buffer LRU list so the
buffers within a ring are always the same until you add or delete buffers from them.

This project was inspired by [[MTorus]]. I tried MTorus but it was far too complex
for my tastes. The generality complicated the interface, and the code was a labyrinth
of hooks.

In essence I wanted a ring, not a Dyson's Sphere :)

: 'Halo' vs 'Dyson's Sphere' might work, since both are large space structures. In this case 'ring' vs 'torus' might be more appropriate. --CH

This implementation is simple, a couple of files massing only 500+ lines.

Here are the buffer-ring commands:

add/delete
* buffer-ring-add    ;;     add the buffer to a ring
* buffer-ring-delete ;;  delete a buffer from the ring

buffer rotation
* buffer-ring-prev-buffer  ;; next buffer in the ring
* buffer-ring-next-buffer  ;; previous buffer in the ring
* buffer-ring-cycle        ;; cycle buffers. Next in the ring or use other-buffer if not in
                           ;; a ring.
* buffer-ring-list-buffers ;; list the buffers in the buffer ring

global ring (torus) rotation
* buffer-torus-prev-ring   ;; previous ring
* buffer-torus-next-ring   ;; next ring
* buffer-torus-list-rings  ;; list the rings in the torus
* buffer-torus-delete-ring ;; delete the current buffer ring from the torus

If it is too simple for you I suggest MTorus. I will definitely not add mark rings.
set-mark-command-repeat-pop works well enough for me.

== Status ==

This is a work in progress. The major functions have been completed. There may still be some
bug hunting and polishing left. I welcome anyone to try it.

please contact me with problems or suggestions [[codermattie]].

Version 0.1.0 20011-03-26

  * complete the interface by adding a function to delete buffer rings from the global torus

Version 0.1.1 2013-10-29

  * some bad bugs were fixed. It now works well with my heavy use. I wish the code
    was prettier but the functionality is now solid.

== Download ==

* [[dynamic-ring.el]]
* [[buffer-ring.el]]

This is great, a simpler MTorus. But what would be greater is integration with ibuffer. ibuffer can filter buffers according to rules, it would be good if I could create buffer rings from such ibuffer groups. Also, There is no completion on buffer add/delete. Could you put these files on github (or somesuch) so I could contribute if needed, thanks. --CH

Ok, I've Tried using Buffer-Ring with [[Espect]] with some sucess:

 ; start buffer-ring with espect filtering
 (require 'espect)
 (require 'buffer-ring)
 (setq espect-buffer-settings
       '(((:mode "eshell-mode")
 	 (:mode "term-mode")
 	 (lambda () (buffer-ring-add "term")))
 	((:mode "org-mode")
 	 (lambda () (buffer-ring-add "ORG")))
 	((:mode "emacs-lisp-mode")
 	 (lambda () (buffer-ring-add "elisp")))
 	((:mode "c-mode")
 	 (lambda () (buffer-ring-add "C-SRC")))
 	((:mode "python-mode")
 	 (lambda () (buffer-ring-add "Python-SRC")))
 	((:mode "dired-mode")
 	 (lambda () (buffer-ring-add "dired")))
 	((:name "^\\*scratch\\*")
 	 (lambda () (buffer-ring-add "emacs-regular")))
 	))
 
 ; this needs to be done specially
 (save-excursion
   (switch-to-buffer "\*Messages\*")
   (buffer-ring-add "emacs-regular"))
 ; don't show welcome message
 (setq inhibit-splash-screen t)
 ;; It might be better just to use the
 ;; filters, and to run all current
 ;; buffers through it once espect starts.
