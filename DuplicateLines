Here's how to find duplicate lines and keep only the first occurrence.

  (defun uniquify-all-lines-region (start end)
    "Find duplicate lines in region START to END keeping first occurrence."
    (interactive "*r")
    (save-excursion
      (let ((end (copy-marker end)))
        (while
            (progn
              (goto-char start)
              (re-search-forward "^\\(.*\\)\n\\(\\(.*\n\\)*\\)\\1\n" end t))
          (replace-match "\\1\n\\2")))))
  
  (defun uniquify-all-lines-buffer ()
    "Delete duplicate lines in buffer and keep first occurrence."
    (interactive "*")
    (uniquify-lines-region (point-min) (point-max)))

So for this buffer:

{{{
Duplicate line 1
Unique line 1


Duplicate line 1
Unique line 2
Unique line 3

Duplicate line 1


Duplicate line 2
Duplicate line 2
Unique line 4

}}}

Running `M-x uniquify-all-lines-buffer' produces:

{{{
Duplicate line 1
Unique line 1

Unique line 2
Unique line 3
Duplicate line 2
Unique line 4
}}}

The above can also be done with another implementation that adds distinct lines to a temporary list, and checks each line in the list with `assoc'.

  (defun uniquify-all-lines-region (start end)
    "Find duplicate lines in region START to END keeping first occurrence."
    (interactive "*r")
    (save-excursion
      (let ((lines) (end (copy-marker end)))
        (goto-char start)
        (while (and (< (point) (marker-position end))
                    (not (eobp)))
          (let ((line (buffer-substring-no-properties
                       (line-beginning-position) (line-end-position))))
            (if (member line lines)
                (delete-region (point) (progn (forward-line 1) (point)))
              (push line lines)
              (forward-line 1)))))))

The Unix utility called ##uniq##
removes duplicate consecutive lines, keeping only one instance.
The output of ##uniq## on the example above is:

{{{
Duplicate line 1
Unique line 1

Duplicate line 1
Unique line 2
Unique line 3

Duplicate line 1

Duplicate line 2
Unique line 4

}}}

Note that non-consecutive duplication of the first line are not removed.

The Unix utility ##sort## can get the same result of unique lines as `M-x uniquify-all-lines-buffer' using the ##-u## argument.  However, the lines are sorted rather than kept in the order of first appearance.
The output of ##sort -u## on the example above is:

{{{

Duplicate line 1
Duplicate line 2
Unique line 1
Unique line 2
Unique line 3
Unique line 4
}}}


The command `M-x uniquify-buffer' will remove identical adjacent lines
in current buffer, giving a result similar to what would be obtained with
the Unix uniq command.

  (defun uniquify-region-lines (beg end)
    "Remove duplicate adjacent lines in region."
    (interactive "*r")
    (save-excursion
      (goto-char beg)
      (while (re-search-forward "^\\(.*\n\\)\\1+" end t)
        (replace-match "\\1"))))
  
  (defun uniquify-buffer-lines ()
    "Remove duplicate adjacent lines in the current buffer."
    (interactive)
    (uniquify-region-lines (point-min) (point-max)))
