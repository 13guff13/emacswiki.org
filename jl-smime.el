;;; Commentary:
;; In general, I recommend GnuPG over S/MIME (which is the default for Gnus).
;; Unless you are in a restricted setting, say in a university or corporate
;; setting, the trust model regarding certificate authorities is broken.
;; You may want to recall the recent certificate authority failures concerning
;; DigiNotar and Trustwave:
;; https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/sjs/diginotar-hack-highlights-critical-failures-our-ssl-web-security-model
;; http://www.h-online.com/news/item/Trustwave-issued-a-man-in-the-middle-certificate-1429982.html
;; Although the impact of those failures appears to be restricted to SSL
;; certificates, I don't see any reason why S/MIME certificates should be more
;; trustworthy.

;; Having said that, in my university, I trust the CA to sign keys for the
;; correct owners, and more colleagues seem to own S/MIME certificates than
;; GnuPG keys.

;; S/MIME support in Gnus is somewhat limited.  This file redefines some Gnus
;; functions and adds new ones to include proper support for multiple
;; recipients, retrieval and caching of certificates from LDAP servers, and
;; (via jl-encrypt.el) automatic insertion of MML tags into messages if
;; certificates for all recipients are available.

;; For basic setup information concerning S/MIME in GNU Emacs (Gnus, in
;; fact), I recommend that you read Info node `(message) Security'
;; https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/message/Security.html
;; and the Emacs Wiki entry: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GnusSMIME

;; Install:
;; Place this file as well as jl-encrypt.el into your load-path,
;; and add the following to ~/.emacs:

;;     (load "jl-smime")

;; You may want to check the subsequent comments to understand the rationale
;; of my modifications and of my additions to standard message behavior.

;; This file is *NOT* part of GNU Emacs.

;;; Code:
(require 'smime)
(require 'mml-smime)
(require 'jl-encrypt)

;; S/MIME does not have an encrypt-to option like GnuPG in gpg.conf.
;; To compensate for this lack, add From header to recipients.
(add-to-list 'jl-recipient-headers "from")

;; I'm searching for S/MIME certificates via LDAP at DFN-Verein.
(require 'ldap)
(setq ldap-default-base "O=DFN-Verein,C=DE"
      ; -x: no SASL authentication, -tt: store result in file

      )

;; Cache S/MIME passphrase for 600 seconds.  (Default is 16.)
(require 'password-cache)

;; No configuration options beyond this point.  Just code.
