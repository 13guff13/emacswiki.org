== Introduction ==

w3m-session ([[Lisp:w3m-session.el]]) provides persistent
[[emacs-w3m]] browsing sessions. When quitting w3m (or, if you request
it, at any other time while using it) you can save the current w3m
session (that is, the set of open tabs and the URLs they're
visiting). Upon restarting emacs-w3m (possibly after restarting Emacs
itself) you'll have the possibity of recovering the saved session
(that is, of re-opening the saved tabs and URLs). You also have at
your disposal a command to recover the saved session at any other
time.

== Installation ==

Just put the file somewhere on your Emacs load path and add the
following line to your InitFile:

  (require 'w3m-session)

After restarting Emacs (or evaluating the form above), each time
you start emacs-w3m with 'w3m' you'll get a prompt asking whether
your last browsing session should be loaded. Likewise, when
quitting the browser, you'll have the possibility of saving your
current session (overwriting the previous one).

In addition, two new interactive functions are defined:

  w3m-session-load  --  load the last stored session
  w3m-session-save  --  save the current session

These functions can be invoked at any time while running emacs-w3m.
Optionally, you can bind them to key shortcuts with the proper
variations of the following elisp magic in your InitFile:

 (defun w3m-add-keys ()
   (define-key w3m-mode-map "S" 'w3m-session-save)
   (define-key w3m-mode-map "L" 'w3m-session-load))
 (add-hook 'w3m-mode-hook 'w3m-add-keys)

== Customization ==

A new customization group, w3m-session, is available. There you can
customize the following variables:

  w3m-session-load-always     -- if t, `w3m-session-load' will *not* ask
                               for confirmation (default nil)
  w3m-session-save-always     -- if t, `w3m-session-load' will *not* ask
                               for confirmation (default nil)
  w3m-session-show-titles     -- if t, the load prompt will list the
                               session URL titles (default t)
  w3m-session-duplicate-tabs  -- what to do when loading a session that
                               contains a URL already open
  w3m-session-file            -- the file where w3m session info
                               is stored (default "~/.w3m-session")

You can also customize them in your InitFile, to wit:

  (setq w3m-session-file "~/.emacs.d/w3m-session")
  (setq w3m-session-save-always nil)
  (setq w3m-session-load-always nil)
  (setq w3m-session-show-titles t)
  (setq w3m-session-duplicate-tabs 'ask) ;  'never, 'always, 'ask
