PeterMilliken wrote ELSE, the Emacs Language Sensitive Editor---a minor mode
for Emacs.  He claims that using it requires no lisp knowledge (unlike SkeletonMode and TempoMode).

It comes with a 40+ page users manual.
It allows the generation of textual templates from either abbreviations or
other mechanisms i.e. does the same job as tempo or skeleton but you don't
have to understand EmacsLisp to get it working. You don't have to read the code
either.

You can get it from here:

Douglas Harter has made some additional templates here:
