I've been an Emacs user since the late '90s, firstly using XEmacs for its multi-terminal capability then I switched to GNU Emacs around 2005. I see emacs as a wonderful, composable tool that is the perfect excuse for believing in the lost wisdom of ancient cultures. Indeed, it has been my gateway to learning Lisp.

I've written a bunch of utility functions in emacs lisp to help with Perl development and editing HTML, CSS and Javascript. Elnode and Websockets interest me very much.
