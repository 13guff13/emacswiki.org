We're moving to a new server. I've disabled editing for the moment. Administrators can still edit pages but their changes will be lost.
Once we're done, there is an additional delay as you will need to wait for the DNS changes to propagate. Sometime withing the next 24h
you should be redirected to the new server and editing will be enabled again.
