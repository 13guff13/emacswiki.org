rcirc is a next generation IRC client. It blends seamlessly with the
rest of emacs, it's tight, fast, and doesn't light up like a christmas
tree. rcirc also has sane defaults. There is little or no reason to
customize it because it does what you want by default (except that many people still do. :))

rcirc is part of GNU Emacs since release 22.0.

==Talking about rcirc==

If you want to chat about rcirc, the place is <tt>#rcirc</tt> on freenode.

==Getting rcirc==

If you are running Emacs 22, you already have it.  Skip this section.

To check out rcirc.el from EmacsFromCVS: CVS:net/rcirc.el.

New versions of rcirc do not work in Emacs 21. You can get the last version of rcirc working in Emacs 21 here: Lisp:rcirc.el.

==Starting rcirc==

In Emacs 22, just type ##M-x irc##.

On Emacs 21 and/or very old rcirc version, you will have to add this to your .emacs:

    (eval-after-load "rcirc"                ; for emacs 21
      '(if (not (functionp 'irc))
           (defun irc (x)
             (interactive "P")
             (if x
                 (call-interactively 'rcirc)
               (rcirc rcirc-server rcirc-port rcirc-nick
                      (rcirc-startup-channels rcirc-server))))))

then just do as usual.

rcirc comes set up with default values for IRC server and port (irc.freenode.net 6667), nickname (your login name), and channel (#rcirc). You can override these settings in your .emacs file or use C-u M-x rcirc to set these values.
You also can define a key to start it for you:

    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c I") 'irc)

; rcirc tracking with [[elscreen]]: when using [[elscreen]] the default "switch-to-buffer" function used by rcirc-track-minor-mode can be changed. To make rcirc switch to the screen where the buffer with the last activity is located simple add to ~/.emacs <code>(setq rcirc-switch-to-buffer-function 'elscreen-find-and-goto-by-buffer)</code>. This has a problem though: automatic switching after some actions (joining a channel, for example) will stop working. One possible solution is:
{{{
		(defun rcirc-switch-buffer-or-screen (buffer)
		  (if (elscreen-find-screen-by-buffer buffer)
		      (elscreen-find-and-goto-by-buffer buffer)
		    (switch-to-buffer buffer)))
		
		(setq rcirc-switch-to-buffer-function 'rcirc-switch-buffer-or-screen)

==Questions & Answers==
[[VincentFoley]] asks: could anyone describe the differences between rcirc and ERC from an end-user point of view?

AlexSchroeder replies: For beginners, there should be no significant differences. After all, both claim to be easy-to-use IRC clients. The differences begin when customizing or hacking it. Neither of the two has introduced radical changes to the user interface.

WeakishJiang: I have not used ERC. But I found this piece on [[InternetRelayChat|this page]]:

   I used ERC for a while, but I was not very fond of the 20 odd files required in 
   my elisp directory, so I switched to rcirc and haven’t looked back since. It does
   everything I need, the (very clean) code is contained in a single file, I’m very happy!
