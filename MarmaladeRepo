[https://marmalade-repo.org/ Marmalade] is an [[ELPA]] compatible
package repository that allows users to upload their own packages.
Package maintainers don't have to be the same as the maintainers of
the original code. This is somewhat like major GNU/Linux distributions.

Marmalade endeavours to deliver stable releases. This means some
packages are considered stale.


The repository has had availability problems and is now managed by
NicFerrier who says he is slowly fixing things.


== Marmalade vs ELPA vs MELPA ==

Unlike [[MELPA]], but like GnuELPA, Marmalade cannot automatically
upload libraries from the %%EmacsWiki%% ElispArea. This is considered
a feature by Marmalade users.

Unlike [[MELPA]], but like GnuuELPA, Marmalade is restricted to only
free software packages.

Unlike GnuELPA, but like MELPA, Marmalade requires no signing of FSF
Copyright papers.

Marmalade is currently the only HTTPS secured repository. It is not
possible to upload or download packages without HTTPS.

Marmalade uses an [[http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/marmalade-client Emacs client]]
to upload and download packages.
