[http://marmalade-repo.org/ Marmalade] is an [[ELPA]] compatible
package repository that allows users to upload their own packages.
Package maintainers don't have to be the same as the maintainers of
the original code.

Some packages (for instance, slime) are out of date however.

The repository has had availability problems and is now managed by
NicFerrier who says he is slowly fixing things.

Unlike [[MELPA]], but like GnuELPA:
* Marmalade cannot automatically upload libraries from the %%EmacsWiki%% ElispArea.
* Marmalade is restricted to only free software packages.

Unlike GnuELPA, but like MELPA, Marmalade requires no signing of FSF Copyright papers.
