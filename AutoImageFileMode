Use M-x auto-image-file-mode to enable Emacs to open graphic files
such as JPEG or PNG format files.  Whether Emacs is able to display a
certain file format depends on your installation -- Emacs must have
been compiled with the correct options (or it must have detected the
libraries at configuration time).

The code that does this is also used by Gnus, for example, to inline
MIME attachments of the correct format.

<code>auto-image-file-mode</code> works by turning any insert-file of an image into an image display property.  This is a little bit scary, depending what sort of things you normally do with insert file.  GNU Emacs 22 has instead a new ImageMode which is a major mode, which you might prefer (it's in fact the new default).
