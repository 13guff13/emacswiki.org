=Emacs speaks SHELL=

==Overview==

This is a package for providing extra functionality when writing in sh-mode (eg bash). It is designed to emulate what ESS (emacs speaks statistics) is to R.

==Where is it?==

Download the package from the following link:
http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/essh.el


==Notes==
I am quite new to elisp, so I am sure the package may not be written in the most efficient way...but it gets the job done. Any recommendations are always welcome!

==Discussion==
If you put your questions here, I'll try to address them.
