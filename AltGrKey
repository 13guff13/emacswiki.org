== Problem with International Keyboards ==

Emacs keys may be "hidden" because *AltGr* + *Control* + *key* is just *AltGr* + *key*
For example on a Swedish keyboard @ and \ are typed using *AltGr*. 
This means that all things bound to C-@ anywhere in a keymap (at any depth) is not possible to type. 
Here are a list of commands that are currently not available to me on my keyboard this way in my current mode:
(and to Fabian Hombsch on a german keyboard)

* C-M-@ mark-sexp
* C-@ set-mark-command
* C-x C-@ pop-global-mark
* C-x r C-@ point-to-register
* C-M-\ indent-region
* C-x RET C-\ set-input-method
* C-] abort-recursive-edit

== Looking for a common solution ==

Every Emacs user of course solves this problem in their own way. I am looking for a common solution that would make it more easy for new users and more easy if you use Emacs in a new place.

== altgr.el ==

[new]
Because of the excellent explanation below about *AltGr* '''+''' *RCtrl* I have thrown altgr.el in the big wastebasket.

== Problems ==

I have done this under MS Windows.
I do not know if this works under other OS:es running on a PC.
Please tell us!
Are the code for the keys the same on all PCs?
Are they the same on other OS:es?

[new]
I think the whole problem only exists under MS Windows because it implements *AltGr* as *Alt* + *Left Control*.  For the X Window System e.g. <code>Mode_switch</code>, which is usually mapped to *AltGr*, is a different modifier, completely unrelated to *Alt* or *Control*.

== Using the Right Control ==

Are you sure all these combinations are really non-typeable? I use a Spanish keyboard
with *AltGr* and I can type them all. The trick is that you must type *AltGr* as the first
key, and *Ctrl* must be the *right* control key, not the left one.

So, on my Spanish keyboard, I can do:

   C-M-@ => AltGr RCtrl Alt 2
   C-@   => AltGr RCtrl 2
   C-M-\ => AltGr RCtrl Alt ยบ
   C-\   => AltGr RCtrl ยบ
   C-]   => AltGr RCtrl +

just fine.

Today (2006-12-17) I saw on Emacs developers list that *RCtrl* must be typed before *AltGr*. Seems like something has changed. Anyone else that have seen this?

[new]
Yes! It works very nice, thanks for the hint! Still, those shortcuts are real finger twisters, but now at least I *can* type them. Again, thanks! -- MaDa, using a Swedish keyboard

Today (2007-02-20) I have to type *AltGr* before *RCtrl* again.
Even if I use an old CVS Emacs from the date above.
Anyone who understands this?

See also StickyModifiers. This is an OS feature. With those on you can type the keys one by one.
