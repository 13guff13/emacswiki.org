== Problem with AltGR on International Keyboards on MS Windows ==

Emacs keys may seem to be "hidden" (perhaps only) on MS Windows because *AltGr* + *LeftControl* + *key* is just *AltGr* + *key*.
For example on a Swedish keyboard @ and \ are typed using *AltGr*. 
This means that all things bound to C-@ anywhere in a keymap (at any depth) are at least a bit difficult to type.

Note: I think the whole problem only exists under MS Windows because it implements *AltGr* as *Alt* + *Left Control*.  For the X Window System e.g. <code>Mode_switch</code>, which is usually mapped to *AltGr*, is a different modifier, completely unrelated to *Alt* or *Control*.



== Solution 1: Using the Right Control ==

But you can type those keys even on MS Windows!
The trick is that you must type *AltGr* as the first
key, and *Ctrl* must be the *right* control key, not the left one.

So, on my Spanish keyboard, I can do:

   C-M-@ => AltGr RCtrl Alt 2
   C-@   => AltGr RCtrl 2
   C-M-\ => AltGr RCtrl Alt ยบ
   C-\   => AltGr RCtrl ยบ
   C-]   => AltGr RCtrl +

just fine.


== Solution 2: Using Alternate Key Bindings ==

It turns out that instead of C-@ you can always type C-SPACE.
(Don't ask me why, I have forgotten. Anyone remembers?)

So this makes it a lot easier to type these commands:

   C-M-@        mark-sexp          => C-M-SPACE
   C-@          set-mark-command   => C-SPACE
   C-x C-@      pop-global-mark    => C-x C-SPACE
   C-x r C-@    point-to-register  => C-x r C-SPACE

And indentation is so common so it has a very convenient binding:

   C-M-\        indent-region      => TAB


=== AltGr key combos without alternatives ===

The keys below are still troublesome. (Maybe there are more?) You need solution 1 here:

* Very troublesome since they may be frequent:

   M-{		backward-paragraph
   M-}		forward-paragraph
   M-$		ispell-word
   M-@		mark-word
   M-\		delete-horizontal-space

* A bit more for experts:

   M-|		shell-command-on-region
   C-]          abort-recursive-edit
   M-~		not-modified

* Maybe not so common:

   C-x RET C-\  set-input-method
   C-\		toggle-input-method
   C-h C-\	describe-input-method




== Making it possible to actually type this: Sticky Modifiers ==

If actually type these difficult with /AltGr/ combinations you are either probably a first class guitarist or a normal human using StickyModifiers.
This is an OS feature. With those on you can type the keys one by one.

=== The order of things ===

Unfortunately using StickyModifiers is not enough.
In the case with Alt Gr you also have to type the keys in a certain order.

Today (2006-12-17) I saw on Emacs developers list that *RCtrl* must be typed before *AltGr*. Seems like something has changed. Anyone else that have seen this?

[new]
Yes! It works very nice, thanks for the hint! Still, those shortcuts are real finger twisters, but now at least I *can* type them. Again, thanks! -- MaDa, using a Swedish keyboard

Today (2007-02-20) I have to type *AltGr* before *RCtrl* again.
Even if I use an old CVS Emacs from the date above.
Anyone who understands this?

== Questions and suggestions ==

Esc-Ctrl-@, for example, will work for this on every platform. (Aidan Kehoe, Mon Nov 30 16:20:24 GMT 2009)

Unfortunately it will not work at all if you are using Viper.
And you have the same problem with Alt Gr here.
