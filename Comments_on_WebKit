It need PyQt5 and Python-EPC, it possible to build those depend on non-linux platform, but i just test it on Linux.

When I try  to load the file webkit.el into emacs I get the following error message:

Loading  /my/path/webkit/webkit.el (source)...
load-with-code-conversion: Symbol's value as variable is void: <!DOCTYPE
user-error: Minibuffer window is not active

What does this error message mean? I also am having some trouble installing the prerequisite libraries on Fedora 19:

PyQt5:        not tried yet, should this be in yum or do I really have to install it from http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro

Python-Xlib: I got it from yum install python-xlib.noarch  

Python-EPC:  I downloaded it from https://github.com/tkf/python-epc, got hold of pip and ran sudo pip install epc. it claimed success

At his point I still get the error referred to at the top of this message.

UPDATE: I also installed  72 Packages (+7 Dependent packages) with the command yum install "qt5*". Same error message.

UPDATE2: I have now compiled PyQt5 and make-install'ed it. Still same error message when loading webkit.el.

UPDATE3: github website had given me the html instead of py files, hence the error. Webkit.el loads, next test the browser...

UPDATE4: I did M-X webkit-open-url , entered http://www.google.com , a buffer came up but the wepage is not showing.
There is a process /bin/python /my/path/webkit/browser.py running, but it uses little cpu if any.
There is a minibuffer status message  that says 

Focus view: "e890abd1-1c97-4b29-9c9d-d842ddf56d62"

Any ideas for me?
