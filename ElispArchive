Hello,

If you are receiving this message, hopefully you are one of the people
who has submitted an entry to the OSU Emacs Lisp Archive.  If not, I
apologize, as my "grep" must have accidentally pulled in your name :)

Due to time constraints and duplication of functionality, I currently
plan to close the OSU Emacs Lisp archive as soon as [http://savannah.gnu.org Savannah] allows
for non-GNU programs.

Savannah is a much more advanced technology; it will allow for CVS
access, web space, etc.  And the [EmacsLispList Emacs Lisp List] and Google seem to be
much better resources for finding particular EmacsLisp programs.  But I
currently do plan to keep the OSU archive open until Savannah is fully
operational, and probably some time after.

I think this change is for the better, but if you feel otherwise,
please feel free to say so, and why.

Thanks!
