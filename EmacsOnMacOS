== Classic ==

Emacs can be compiled on the classic MacOS using the Macintosh
Programmer's Workshop.  MPW is a unix-like environment for the
MacOS, which used to cost thousands $$$$ USD but is
now freely available due to believed obsolescence.  Die hard
MacOS9 aficiondos rejoice.

MPW is available from:
ftp://ftp.apple.com/developer/Tool_Chest/Core_Mac_OS_Tools/MPW_etc./

Then, follow the instructions in the Emacs source, in the file $EMACS/mac/INSTALL .

== OS X ==

Directions for accessing the emacs CVS are found at ##<http://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group=emacs>##. To download emacs, use the command:

     cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.savannah.gnu.org:/sources/emacs co emacs

Directions to build and install may be found in the file newly downloaded to emacs/mac/INSTALL. The basic build and installation of the carbon Emacs application uses the commands:

    ./configure --enable-carbon-app
    make
    sudo make install

There are many options for building emacs (such as whether to build the X11 version), which are discussed in the INSTALL file. There is also a script (emacs/mac/make-package) to create a Mac OS X package for use by the installer.

Emacs 23's should be configured with --with-ns to use the Cocoa frontend.
