Obviously a lot of mailing lists have been founded to discuss Emacsen.
The official GnuEmacs lists are hosted at the GNU nurtury Savannah.
See the [http://savannah.gnu.org/mail/?group=emacs Emacs project page
there] for a complete list.  The primary [[XEmacs]] lists are hosted
by http://xemacs.org, as listed on http://xemacs.org/Lists/index.html.

The various Emacs programs might have their own lists too.  Check the
homepages of these proggies, and if EmacsWiki has an entry.  Many of
them live on Savannah or SourceForge.  Don't worry too much about
posting to a generic list though, the ever-helpful people there will
redirect you to a more specific list if they considered necessary.

= Mailing lists via news =

Some of the EmacsNewsgroups are bidirectionally gatewayed as
mailinglists, and vice versa.  Generally it is better if you subscribe
to newsgroups instead of mailing lists, because then the load is
spread amongst many newsservers instead of one mailing list host.

Quite a lot of EmacsMailingLists are available as EmacsNewsgroups too,
throught one gateway or an another.  One such gateway is
[http://gmane.org Gmane], where their hierarchy
<code>gmane.emacs</code> contains most of the Emacs-related lists
available there.
