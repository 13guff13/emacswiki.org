Yet another Emacs hacker. I go by [::technomancy] on IRC.

I've written a few fun modes:

* [http://github.com/technomancy/conspire Conspire], a system for collaborative editing.
* [http://augment.rubyforge.org Augment], a system for gathering and displaying metadata about a file.
* Rinari, a mode for RubyOnRails (now maintained by Eric Schulte)
* Lisp:pcmpl-ssh.el (PcompleteSSH) (Note: this has been merged into Emacs 23)

I've contributed to some others:

* ErtTestLibrary for automated testing.
* [Magit] for working with Git repositories.
* EmacsRi for reading Ruby documentation

Deprecated:

* ebby, a mode for CollaborativeEditing. Sadly subject to bitrot under recent versions of Obby. (use conspire instead)
* Lisp:elunit.el (ElUnit), a mode for UnitTesting (use ERT instead)

I also hack on [http://conkeror.mozdev.org Conkeror] for fun. I get paid to write Ruby code mostly. In case you couldn't tell I'm test-addicted.

All this stuff can also be found in [http://github.com/technomancy/dotfiles my public dotfiles repo].

Hi!
After seeing some git+eshell snippet on your github page, I was wondering: do you use git under eshell sucessfully?
It worked for me on Windows, but on Linux it just said "NOT A REAL TERMINAL" when I tried `git log' and others.
(sorry for messing around - could not find your email)
--hsu

hsu: you have to set your PAGER environment variable to "cat"; then it works great. (setenv "PAGER" "cat") But instead of using git log in the shell, I'd recommend using magit instead; it's much nicer.
