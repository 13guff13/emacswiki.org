I am using GNU Emacs and wrote a little utility that helps me to program easily in C++ 
under Emacs. Just some "project managment" stuff. Generally pieces of
code that somehow emulates RHIDE and similars.

The project is not oftenly maintained and has few minor bugs but it might 
be helpful after all. You can find it in http://neorural.jinak.cz/emacs

Welcome on the wiki ! Your package looks interesting, I always wanted to code something like that, I'll have a look at it. -- LucasBonnet

Well, actually I'm more interested in the Makefile automatic handling, to add new targets and modules with few keystrokes
