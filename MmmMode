== Overview ==

Multiple Major Modes by MichaelAbrahamShulman. This one is used on the OracleProC page. It was once method of choice for combining major modes, development stalled from 2004-2011, and restarted mid-2012. You can find description of using it, together with psgml-mode, php-mode, javascript-mode and css-mode to edit HTML files at HtmlModeDeluxe.

== Notes ==

There has been some attempts to get it working with NxmlMode for XHTML, see NxmlModeForXHTML.

== Getting mmm-mode For Emacs 24 & Beyond ==

A git clone containing bug fixes for Emacs >= 23 is here: https://github.com/purcell/mmm-mode . It is the home for future mmm-mode development; the [[http://mmm-mode.sourceforge.net/ old SourceForge page]] for mmm-mode now references it. All contributions are welcome.
