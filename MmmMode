== Overview ==

Multiple Major Modes by MichaelAbrahamShulman. This one is used on the OracleProC page. It seems to have been the method of choice for combining major modes, but the latest version is now from 2004. You can find description of using it, together with psgml-mode, php-mode, javascript-mode and css-mode to edit HTML files at HtmlModeDeluxe.

There has been some attempts to get it working with NxmlMode for XHTML, see NxmlModeForXHTML.
