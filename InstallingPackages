== Installing packages from the Internet ==

The most common method of installing packages of Emacs Lisp since Emacs 24 has been [[ELPA]] packages.

Additional package archives such as  [[MELPA]] or [[MarmaladeRepo]] exist to supplement what is in [[ELPA]].


=== Basic package installation ===

Type <code>M-x list-packages</code> to open the package list.  Press i to mark for installation, u to unmark, and x to perform the installation.  Press enter to read more about installing and using each package.  

I recommend you start with the package <code>paradox</code>.  This will install the improved <code>paradox-list-packages</code>, which among other things gives the ability to sort package list by GitHub popularity.  Starting with the most popular packages is a good way to find the most useful and effective ones.  

=== Using and configuring packages ===

Many packages come with instructions on installation and use.  These can be viewed in the package manager.

A useful tool for organizing your package collection is the /use-package/ package. Its homepage is here and it can be found on MELPA.  https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package

For more inspiration and examples, you should look into the source of the emacs starter configurations such as the ones found [[http://ergoemacs.org/misc/list_of_emacs_starter_kits.html here]].  

== Installing individual elisp files ==

Some emacs lisp configuration is offered in the form of elisp snippets, or individual .el files.  You can begin by collecting these files together in a directory  ~/.emacs.d/private/

Make sure this directory is listed in your `load-path' variable. This is achieved by:

    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/private")

You can read more about the `load-path' at LoadPath. 

If you have put a file called /custom.el/ in a directory contained in your load path, simply add: 

    (load-file "custom.el")
