== Installing a new file ==

Make sure you have a local directory where you put elisp files.  I use ~/elisp, for example.

Make sure this directory is listed in your `load-path' variable.  I use the following statement in my ~/.emacs file to make sure it is:

    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp")

XEmacs documentation (21.4 (patch 14)) for load-path says: "Note that the elements of this list *may not* begin with '~', so you must call <code>expand-file-name</code> on them before adding them to this list." So, for [[XEmacs]], the above should be:

    (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))

You can read more about the `load-path' at LoadPath. You can also add the needed paths to the <code>EMACSLOADPATH</code>
environment variable, if you prefer.

== Installing Modes ==

If the code in the elisp file is supposed to be a mode for files whose names match a pattern, see AutoModeAlist.
If the code in the elisp file is supposed to be a mode for files who are run by certain interpreters, see InterpreterModeAlist.

== Installing bigger packages ==

For bigger packages such as [[Gnus]] or [[BBDB]], you usually install them somewhere, run ''./configure; make; make install'' and then figure out where the package got installed.
Then add that directory to your ''load-path''.

Some packages can be run uncompiled.  In that case, just unpack them, and add the corresponding directory to your ''load-path''.

Example:

    (add-to-list 'load-path "/home/alex/src/erc")
    (require 'erc-auto)
    (autoload 'erc "erc")

This requires some knowledge about the package, of course.  In the above case, for example, I
knew that erc-auto defines lots of autoloads, but does not autoload ''erc'' itself (use ''erc-select''
to connect to network)...

== Installing packages from Internet ==

There exist hundreds of Emacs Lisp libraries but GNU Emacs does not contain a package manager allowing users to easily install those libraries and keep them up-to-date.

There is a list of package managers on CategoryCode that have been created to fill this gap.

Some packages exist whose only purpose is to update another single package.

* Lisp:icicles-install.el -- Download and optionally byte-compile Icicles

See WishList for discussion of adding package management to Emacs.
