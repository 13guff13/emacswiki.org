[[zh:安装软件包]]

The most common method of installing packages of Emacs Lisp since Emacs 24 has been [[ELPA]] packages.

Additional package archives such as [[MELPA]] or [[MarmaladeRepo]] exist to supplement what is in [[ELPA]].

[:package-archives]
== Adding a package source ==

By default, Emacs 24 or later is set up with the [[ELPA]] package
archive. If you need to add more sources, include Emacs code like this
to your InitFile:

{{{
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/"))
}}}

Alternatively, you can use the Customize interface with the command `M-x customize-variable package-archives' .

The value will depend on the package source you want to add. See [[MELPA]] or [[MarmaladeRepo]] for more information.

== Installing packages ==

Type <code>M-x list-packages</code> to open the package list.  Press `i' to mark for installation, `u' to unmark, and `x' to perform the installation.  Press `RET' to read more about installing and using each package.  

If you don't see the package listed there, you may need to add another package source to your ##package-archives## variable. See the section on [[#package-archives|adding a package source]].

You may want to start by installing the <code>paradox</code> package.  This will allow you to use the command <code>paradox-list-packages</code>, which among other things gives the ability to sort package list by GitHub popularity.  Starting with the most popular packages is a good way to find the most useful and effective ones.  

== Using and configuring packages ==

Many packages come with instructions on installation and use.  These can be viewed in the package manager by pressing `RET' on the package line.

UsePackage can make it easier for you to organize your package-related configuration. For more information, see its homepage: https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package

For more inspiration and examples, look into the source of the Emacs starter configurations such as the ones found [[http://ergoemacs.org/misc/list_of_emacs_starter_kits.html here]].  

== Installing individual Emacs Lisp files ==

Some Emacs Lisp libraries or configuration snippets not available as packages. To install them, see LoadPath.
