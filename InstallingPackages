== Installing packages from the Internet ==

The most common method of installing packages of Emacs Lisp since Emacs 24 has been [[ELPA]] packages.

Additional package archives such as  [[MELPA]] or [[MarmaladeRepo]] exist to supplement what is in [[ELPA]].


= Basic package installation =

Type <code>M-x list-packages</code> to open the package list.  Press i to mark for installation, u to unmark, and x to perform the installation.  Press enter to read more about installing and using each package.  I recommend you start with the package <code>paradox</code>.  This will install the improved <code>paradox-list-packages</code>, which among other things gives the ability to sort package list by GitHub popularity.  Many of the most useful packages are very popular, so this will help you get started.

= Using and configuring packages = 



== Installing individual elisp files ==

Some emacs lisp configuration is offered in the form of elisp snippets, or individual .el files.  You can begin by collecting these files together in a directory  ~/.emacs.d/private/

Make sure this directory is listed in your `load-path' variable. This is achieved by:

    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/private")

You can read more about the `load-path' at LoadPath. 

If you have put a file called /custom.el/ in a directory contained in your load path, simply add: 

    (load-file "custom.el")
