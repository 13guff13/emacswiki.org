DocViewMode is another file mode viewer like DviViewMode which adds
support for PDF and PS files written by TassiloHorn.  It's official
part of [[Emacs]] 23.

Conversion is done with ghostscript and various other tools.  It even
supports regexp search in documents.

To get it it's best to install Emacs 23 (the current CVS HEAD).

You can get a snapshot of doc-view.el at [[doc-view.el]].

The homepage of DocViewMode is http://www.tsdh.de/cgi-bin/wiki.pl/doc-view.el.

This can be customized via:

  M-x customize-group doc-view RET
