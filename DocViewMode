DocViewMode is another file mode viewer like DviViewMode which adds
support for PDF and PS files written by TassiloHorn.  It's officially
part of [[Emacs]] starting in version 23.

Conversion is done with ghostscript and various other tools.  It even
supports regexp search in documents.  According to the "Document View"
section of the EmacsManual,

: ''`gs' is a hard requirement.  For DVI files, `dvipdf' or `dvipdfm' is needed.  For OpenDocument and Microsoft Office documents, the `unoconv' tool is needed.''

: ''The needed external tools for this document type have to be available, emacs needs to run in a graphical frame, and PNG image support has to be compiled into emacs.''


You can get a snapshot of doc-view.el at [[doc-view.el]].

The homepage of DocViewMode is http://www.tsdh.de/cgi-bin/wiki.pl/doc-view.el.

I like to visit/read pdf-files in emacs, but one (or two) thing(s) that I miss: to save/load (automatically) the current/saved position or pagenumber.
And if possible also the slice that I had set. -- Michael

I don't know about the latter, but it should be possible to use BookMarks to save the last position within DocView.  It would take making an EmacsLisp function and adding it to `kill-buffer-hook' -- AaronHawley
