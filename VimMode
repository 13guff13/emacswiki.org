An implementation of Vi and Vim-like key bindings for emacs.

== Usage ==

Download the package and put the following in your .emacs file:

    (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/vim-mode")
    (require 'vim)
    (vim-mode 1)

== Features ==

vim-mode currently supports the following aspects:

* standard Vi key-bindings in normal-mode/operator-pending-mode
* window-commands (Ctrl-W + ...)
* character-wise, line-wise and block visual-mode
* changable key-bindings
* framework for easy definition of new commands and motions
* basic ex-mode (only latest revision)

== TODO ==

The following aspects are currently not implemented, but should be in future:

* marks
* registers
* most of the text-object motions
* some ex-mode stuff (search/substitude)
* ...

== Downloads ==

vim-mode is available from the bitbucket repository.
