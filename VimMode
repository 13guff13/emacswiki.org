An implementation of Vi and Vim-like key bindings for Emacs.

== Overview ==

Vim-mode is another implementation for Vi and Vim-like key bindings
for Emacs. It is a complete new implementation from scratch with
extensibility in mind. There are several other packages emulating Vim
features, see CategoryEmulation for an overview. 

Before you start using vim-mode you should definitely have look at
[[Vimpulse]] which is another great package for emulating Vim. In
contrast to vim-mode, [[Vimpulse]] is based on the famous ViperMode
which has brought Vi bindings to Emacs for a long time. Therefore
[[Vimpulse]] has to be considered more stable, portable and
feature-rich than vim-mode.

== Quick Start ==

Download the package and put the following in your .emacs file:

    (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/vim-mode")
    (require 'vim)
    (vim-mode 1)

== Documentation ==

* [[VimMode - User's Guide]] Information about the day-to-day usage and of vim-mode and description how to write own commands and motions.
* [[VimMode - Developer's Guide]] Description of the internal structure of vim-mode.

== Examples ==

[[VimMode - Examples]] Example commands and motions.
