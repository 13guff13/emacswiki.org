Similar to WindMove, this package allows you to move between frames using arrow keys.
Additionally, it can hook into WindMove's keys so that when you can't move window (because
you reached the edge of the frame), the next event jumps frames.

To install framemove on its own:

    (require 'framemove)
    (framemove-default-keybindings) ;; default prefix is Meta

But you might want to use this in conjunction with WindMove, in which case this is the integration
code to add to your .emacs:

    (require 'framemove)
    (windmove-default-keybindings)
    (setq framemove-hook-into-windmove t)

Currently, when focus shifts to a new frame - the point does not change inside the frame.
