Command `occur' lists all lines of the current buffer that match a regexp that you give it. The matching lines are listed in buffer `*Occur*', and you can click them there to navigate to the corresponding lines in the original buffer. That is, buffer `*Occur*' acts as a hypertext index to your buffer.

This is so useful that you might want to use a keybinding in your <code>.emacs</code> for it. For example:

 (global-set-key (kbd "C-c o") 'occur)

Starting with Emacs 22, you can also use '''`##C-x `##'''' (`next-error') or `M-g p' (`previous-error') to navigate to the next or previous occurrence.

: I've asked that Emacs bind `n' and `p' in Occur mode to `next-error-no-select' and `previous-error-noselect' (and make the buffer read-only). -- DrewAdams

: Or you can turn on `next-error-follow-minor-mode' in the Occur
buffer. -- SeanO

: Very good. I wasn't aware of that. -- DrewAdams

: Seems that will bind 'C-n' and 'C-p'. I prefer to manually bind n/p for compilation-mode-map and  occur-mode-map and leave C-n/C-p as they are.

[:ReplacePlus]
== Enhancements to Occur: Replace+ ==

DrewAdams has written library Lisp:replace+.el, which provides some enhancements to the standard Emacs <code>occur</code> command.

The <code>occur</code> enhancements include these:

* Occurrences matching the search pattern (regular expression) are highlighted in the <code>*Occur*</code> buffer. The effect is similar to that of highlighting with the Google toolbar. 
* The currently visited target-buffer occurrence matching the search pattern is also highlighted. This helps you see where you are and where you have been.
* In the <code>*Occur*</code> buffer, line numbers of visited lines are highlighted, so you can see that you have already visited them.
* In the <code>*Occur*</code> buffer, you can click anywhere on a found line: the entire line is mouse-face active. 
* The [[Frame]] of the <code>*Occur*</code> buffer is shrink-wrapped to fit the matching lines. 
* More user control over highlight [[Face]]s. 
* Better default value for the string to search for.

Here's a screenshot of the <code>*Occur*</code> buffer and a visited occurrence in the target buffer, showing match-string highlighting, visited-line number highlighting, and full-line mouseover highlighting (underline):

[:IciclesOccur]
== Icicles Occur and Search: Alternatives to Standard Occur ==

Command '''`icicle-occur'''' in '''Icicles''' offers functionality similar to `occur', but with some additional features, including the following:

* You can use '''Icicles''' [[Icicles - Progressive Completion|progressive
completion]] to find lines using multiple regexps.

* Instead of a static `*Occur*' buffer, buffer `*Completions*' is used (with [[Completion]]) for the "occur" matches for your input. The matching occurrences are updated on the fly as you edit your input (which can be a regexp) -- ''incremental occur''. 

* You can search ''multiple buffers'':  `icicle-occur' is a multi-occur (like Emacs 22 commands `multi-occur' and `multi-occur-in-matching-buffers'). All '''Icicles''' search commands can be used to search multiple buffers simultaneously. You can choose the buffers individually, using completion, or pick all that match a regexp.

* If the region is active, then only the region is searched. You need not narrow the buffer to use `icicle-occur' on only part of it.

Here is a screenshot taken when a user is cycling among occurrences that match the regexp `##regexp.*match##'. It shows:

* Buffer `*Completions*' playing a role similar to buffer `*Occur*' in standard Emacs `occur'. The occurrence highlighted light blue is the next one (for cycling).

* Highlighting (green) of the matching occurrences in your buffer. The line highlighted pink is the current one.

[[image:IciclesOccurScreenshot]]

You can cycle among the search hits, navigating to each in turn, with `C-next'. Use `C-mouse-2' in buffer `*Completions*' to go directly to particular hits. To choose a hit as final destination and end search navigating, use `mouse-2' (no `C-'). There are many more options -- for more info, use `##C-?##' while navigating. 

If your MiniBuffer input matches a unique search hit, then you can also get to the hit using completion (`TAB' or `S-TAB'), followed by `RET'. If there are multiple identical hits that match your input, then cycle to the one you want or use `mouse-2' to choose it. `C-M-mouse-2' (or any of the other `C-M-' keys) will tell you the buffer and location of any hit, in the minibuffer.

The big brother of `icicle-occur' is '''`icicle-search''''. It generalizes the functionality of `occur'. The units tested for matches are not necessarily lines, as they are for `occur' and `icicle-occur'; they can be any textual unit: paragraph, sequence of words, page -- anything. A regexp you provide defines this unit and thus the set of entities to be matched (matching is then done with another regexp). Command `icicle-occur' is a special case of `icicle-search' where the initial regexp is `##.*##', which establishes ''lines'' as the text units to search for matches.

Commands `icicle-occur' and `icicle-search' are bound to `##C-c '##' and `##C-c `##', respectively, when ''Icicle'' mode is turned on.

== A More Interactive `occur' ==

  (defun occurs (&optional arg)
    "Switch to *Occur* buffer, or run `occur'.
  Without a prefix argument, switch to the buffer.
  With a universal prefix argument, run occur again.
  With a numeric prefix argument, run occur with NLINES
  set to that number."
    (interactive "P")
    (if (and (not arg) (get-buffer "*Occur*"))
        (switch-to-buffer "*Occur*")
      (occur (read-from-minibuffer "Regexp: ")
             (if (listp arg) 0 arg))))

== switch-to-buffer vs pop-to-buffer ==

Since [who?] didn't like the original behaviour of `occur', [who?] redefined one
of the functions:

 (defun occur-mode-goto-occurrence ()
   "Go to the occurrence the current line describes.
 This function redefined by alex!  Instead of using
 `pop-to-buffer' it now uses `switch-to-buffer'."
   (interactive)
   (let ((pos (occur-mode-find-occurrence)))
     (switch-to-buffer occur-buffer)
     (goto-char (marker-position pos))))

== A Narrow `occur' ==

A numeric argument n specifies that n lines of context are to be displayed
before and after each matching line.

e.g. to show 5 line before and after each matching line:

 C-U 5 M-x occur regexp-to-search

== Call Recursively ==

This allows you to call `occur' on an occur buffer.  Assume you have a
buffer A.  Run `occur' gives you a buffer B.  Run `occur' again.  This
will rename buffer B and give a you buffer C.  If you select a line in
buffer C, that will pop you to the match in buffer B.  Select the line
again and now you are back in buffer A.  As you can see, this is not
optimal and it seems that Emacs 21 will have a better way to deal with
this.

 (defadvice occur (before occur-before)
   "Allow mutliple calls to occur..."
   (if (string-match "\*Occur\*" (buffer-name))
       (rename-buffer (buffer-name) t)))
 (ad-activate 'occur)

== Clean the *Occur* Buffer ==

This gets rid of the line numbers and the header line, so that the result is more like the output from `grep'.  You might want to bind this to C-c C-x.

 (defun occur-mode-clean-buffer ()
   "Removes all commentary from the *Occur* buffer, leaving the
 unadorned lines."
   (interactive)
   (if (get-buffer "*Occur*")
       (save-excursion
         (set-buffer (get-buffer "*Occur*"))
         (goto-char (point-min))
         (toggle-read-only 0)
         (if (looking-at "^[0-9]+ lines matching \"")
             (kill-line 1))
         (while (re-search-forward "^[ \t]*[0-9]+:"
                                   (point-max)
                                   t)
           (replace-match "")
           (forward-line 1)))
     (message "There is no buffer named \"*Occur*\".")))

== Multi-Occur ==

Starting with emacs version 22, there is a command named 
<code>multi-occur</code>, which searches in <em>all</em> of Emacs's buffers (that are visiting files), not just the current one. 

See also `icicle-occur', which also lets you search all buffers. More flexibly, you can choose any number of buffers to search. Also, you can change regexp dynamically. (See above, [[#IciclesOccur]].)

FYI -- In <code>gnu-emacs-sources@gnu.org</code> on 2005-05-11, Joe Corneli posted a library of convenience commands, [[aok.el]], for use with multi-occur. -- DrewAdams

== View the Matched Line - color-occur ==

[http://www.bookshelf.jp/elc/color-occur.el color-occur.el]

Put this file into load-path'ed directory, and byte compile it if desired.  And put the following expression into your ~/.emacs.

 (require 'color-occur)

Run 'occur'. occur buffer will be displayed and the matched line will be showed to other window.

[http://www.bookshelf.jp/elc/color-moccur.el color-moccur.el] shows all occurrences of regexp in <em>all buffers</em>. (See SearchBuffers)

See also Lisp:replace+.el (''Replace+'', above), for another way to highlight occur matches.

== View matches only ==

The following deletes the context around the match on the same line.

{{{
(defun occurrences (regexp &rest ignore)
  "Show all matches for REGEXP in an `occur' buffer."
  ;; keep text covered by occur-prefix and match text-properties
  (interactive (occur-read-primary-args))
  (occur regexp)
  (with-current-buffer (get-buffer "*Occur*")
    (let ((inhibit-read-only t)
	  delete-from
	  pos)
      (save-excursion
	(while (setq pos (next-property-change (point)))
	  (goto-char pos)
	  (if (not (or (get-text-property (point) 'occur-prefix)
		       (get-text-property (point) 'occur-match)))
	      (if delete-from
		  (delete-region delete-from (point))
		(setq delete-from (point)))
	    (when delete-from
	      (delete-region delete-from (point))
	      (if (get-text-property (point) 'occur-prefix)
		  (insert "\n")
		(insert " ")))
	    (setq delete-from nil)))))))
}}}

list-matching-lines does almost the same as occur. There's also delete-matching-lines.
