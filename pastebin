[[de:Pastebin]]
[[de:pastebin]]
pastebin is an Emacs interface to [http://pastebin.com pastebin.com].

You can use it to send little snippets of code (or whole buffers) to the web for sharing with others.

pastebin allows sending of regions or whole buffers and let's you specify the virtual host for pastebin. So you can send code to emacs.pastebin.com or myproject.pastebin.com.

The code is downloadable from the wiki here: [[pastebin.el]]

The code is also on a [https://github.com/nicferrier/elpastebin github repo here.]
----

There are two versions of pastebin's code. One is the main site available on the Internet, the other is an earlier downloadable version. The pastebin elisp library supports both of these via configuration which allows the version supported by a particular domain to be specified.

IvanKorotkov kindly updated this code to match the new [http://pastebin.com/api.php pastebin.com API] and also added customization group added allowing to set default prefix (subdomain) and modes-alist. 

He keeps his version here: [http://tweedle-dee.org/svn/emacs.d/site-lisp/pastebin.el pastebin.el]

RyanDavis customized and changed pastebin-type-assoc for diff-mode to "dff". He also tried  rewriting pastebin.com to see if it can be aliased to "diff" (Almost nothing in the API is shortened, so I suspect this is a problem on their side).
