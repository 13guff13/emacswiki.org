== Overview ==

Org-mode is an Emacs mode for note keeping, project planning, TODO lists and authoring. It is included from Emacs 22.1 onward as default.

Org-mode's [http://orgmode.org/manual/index.html manual], [http://orgmode.org/guide/ compact guide], the community maintained [http://orgmode.org/worg Worg]  (which includes tutorial, ideas, code snippets, etc.,) and can be accessed at [http://orgmode.org its homepage]. [http://www.network-theory.co.uk/org/manual/ Paperback manual] is also available. [http://gnu.manticore.es/manual-org-emacs El Manual de Org], traduccioÃ³n al espaÃ±ol para 23.1.

=== Features ===

* Deadlines, time stamps, scheduling events and TODO items. Integrates Emacs calendar and diary and can compile entries from many files into one view. 
* Table editor (available as a minor mode for use in other major modes).
* HTML and LaTeX export, among others.
* Plain text URL-like links to http, file, gnus, rmail, vm, news, wanderlust, bbdb.
* Integrates with RememberMode.
* an environment for literate programming.

== Download and Install ==

The development version is at:

    git clone git://repo.or.cz/org-mode.git

There is a Ubuntu repository with the latest for non-cvs Emacs.  Add the following to your <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code>:

    deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/hexmode/ubuntu gutsy main
    deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/hexmode/ubuntu gutsy main

== Texts on using org-mode ==

David O'Toole has written a [http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/orgtutorial_dto.html general tutorial] with screenshots. It has been translated into [http://hokmen.chan.googlepages.com/OrgTutorial.en-cn.html Chinese], [http://web.archive.org/web/20080225214358/http://lumiere.ens.fr/~guerry/orgtutorialfr.html French], [http://users.itk.ppke.hu/~mpasztor/orgtutorial/notebook/orgtutorial-hu.html Hungarian], [http://hpcgi1.nifty.com/spen/index.cgi?OrgMode/OrgTutorial Japanese] and [http://jmjeong.com/index.php?display=Emacs/OrgMode Korean]. [http://orgmode.org/worg/ Worg] has many tutorials on specific features. Charles Cave has [http://members.optusnet.com.au/~charles57/GTD/org_dates/index.html has written] on using date and times. Bernt Hansen describes his use and customizations of Org-mode in 70(!) pages long [http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html document], which assumes basic familiarity with Org.

One of the major influences in 2006/2007 on task organization has been the book [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done Getting Things Done] (GTD). Using Org-mode for GTD has been [http://members.optusnet.com.au/~charles57/GTD/orgmode.html described] by Charles Cave and a modest example configuration has been given [http://www.brool.com/index.php/using-org-mode-with-gtd here].

Both [http://newartisans.com/2007/08/using-org-mode-as-a-day-planner/ John Wiegley] and [http://sachachua.com/wp/2007/12/29/how-to-use-emacs-org-as-a-basic-day-planner/ Sacha Chua] have described day planner usage. Another piece by SachaChua is [http://sachachua.com/wp/2007/12/22/a-day-in-a-life-with-org/ "A day in the life with Org"].

== Publishing ==

You can *publish to HTML* using `C-c C-e h', or you can use BhlMode for LaTeX or HTML output. Just switch modes before exporting (`M-x bhl-mode'). BhlMode should automatically recognize the asterisks as marking sections and subsections. See EmacsOutlineToHtml for other alternatives.

== Conflicts ==

If you're using WindMove, CuaMode or MTorus (with default keybindings), you might want to disable the Org Mode keybindings for Shift+arrow keys:

    (setq org-replace-disputed-keys t)

(This need to be done before org.el is loaded, or requires a restart of Emacs to be effective.)

This will result in the following replacements:

*  S-RET   -> C-S-RET
*  S-up    -> M-p
*  S-down  -> M-n
*  S-left  -> M--
*  S-right -> M-+

If AllOut from Emacs 21 is loaded before org.el, you will be getting a ##Wrong type argument ((keymapp nil))## error. This was fixed in Emacs 22.

If you are forced to use Emacs 21, either install a newer version of allout.el, or make sure that org.el is loaded before allout.el.  For example, use ##(require 'org)## before requiring allout.

If you're using session.el (EmacsSession), you need to excempt a circular data structure from saving:

    (add-to-list 'session-globals-exclude 'org-mark-ring)

If you're using Emacs 23 and Org 7.5, then you can also have some pseudo-compatability while maintaining CUA support with Lisp:org-cua-dwim.el

== External Data Sources ==

If you publish external sources to org mode agenda files, you'll need to refresh those files after changes occur.  Try this snippet to reload those files.

    (defun org-reload ()
      (interactive)
      (switch-to-buffer "mail.org")
      (revert-buffer nil 1)
      (org-agenda nil "a")
      (delete-other-windows))

=== Dragging URLs ===

This function uses org-mode support for plain list to facilitate dragging URLs from a webbrowser (or other apps) to an org-mode buffer:

<pre>
(defadvice dnd-insert-text (around org-mouse-dnd-insert-text activate)
  (if (eq major-mode 'org-mode)
      (progn
	(cond
	 ;; if this is the end of the line then just insert text here
	 ((eolp)
	  (skip-chars-backward " \t")
	  (kill-region (point) (point-at-eol))
	  (unless (looking-back ":") (insert ":"))
	  (insert " "))

	 ;; if this is the beginning of the line then insert before
	 ((and (looking-at " \\|\t")
	       (save-excursion
		 (skip-chars-backward " \t") (bolp)))
	  (beginning-of-line)
	  (looking-at "[ \t]*")
	  (open-line 1)
	  (indent-to (- (match-end 0) (match-beginning 0)))
	  (insert "+ "))

	 ;; if this is a middle of the line, then insert after
	 (t
	  (end-of-line)
	  (newline t)
	  (indent-relative)
	  (insert "+ ")))
	(insert text)
	(beginning-of-line))
    ad-do-it))
</pre>

=== Including all org files from a directory into the agenda ===

<pre>
(setq org-agenda-files (file-expand-wildcards "~/org/*.org"))
</pre>

=== Turn header lines into apparent visible separators ===

To make header lines more apparently visible in the buffer, set them a background color and change this part of `org-set-font-lock-defaults', so that the header line is drawn across the screen:

<pre>
	   ;; Headlines
	   '("^\\(\\**\\)\\(\\* \\)\\(.*\xa\\)" (1 (org-get-level-face 1))
	     (2 (org-get-level-face 2)) (3 (org-get-level-face 3)))
</pre>

The only change is the `\xa' character is added before the last closing paren.

=== Following Links ===

To follow links with RET, rather than a 2 key combo:

    (setq org-return-follows-link t)

You can also make TAB follow links in a similar way.

=== Opening pdf at specific page ===
To open links of type [~/test.pdf::3] i.e. open file at page 3:
<pre>
    (delete '("\\.pdf\\'" . default) org-file-apps)
    (add-to-list 'org-file-apps '("\\.pdf::\\([0-9]+\\)\\'" . "evince \"%s\" -p %1"))
</pre>

=== Opening pdf with alternative application ===
To open a link with a program other than the default(e.g. modify a pdf rather than read it):
<pre>
(defun my-org-open-at-point()
  (interactive)
  (let ((org-file-apps '(("\\.pdf\\'" . "xournal %s"))))
    (org-open-at-point)
    ))
</pre>

=== Editing Wikipedia ===

Org Mode can be easily configured to help edit *Wikipedia* articles by changing outline-regexp in the mode hook:

<pre>
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook '(lambda () (setq outline-regexp "=+")))
</pre>

If you use WThreeM, add the following instead:
<pre>
(setq w3m-form-textarea-edit-mode 'org-mode)
(add-hook 'w3m-form-input-textarea-mode-hook
          '(lambda nil
                   (setq outline-regexp "=+")))
</pre>

Org.el is now part of CVS Emacs. Great!

[new]
Google's Code Hosting feature has a new wiki engine. Syntax is a simplified version of MoinMoin. Here's the neat bit: all changes are checked into the subversion repository in the /wiki/ directory -- each file has a *.wiki extension. Would it be possible to use org-mode to edit these? 'Publish' would be bound to 'svn-checkin' (or however that works). They support tags, too! Here's the announcement: http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2006/12/happy-holidays-open-source-developers.html

The HTML exporter define anchor for section and subsection to navigate the document, is it possible to name the anchor like the section number it point to ?

If I have sections 1, 1.1, 1.2 and 2, the section 1.1 has an anchor called sec-2, section 2 has an anchor called 4, why not using sec-1.1, sec-1.2, sec-2 ?

I use the Icalendar export capability to include my tasks to a shared webbased calendar.

I use mutli-state TODOs, I want them to appear in the ics file only for 1 state, example:
#+SEQ_TODO: TO-PLAN WAITING CONFIRMED DONE

I output to the shared calendar only CONFIRMED tasks, others are for my personal organisation.

As I don't want to export everything I modified 'org-print-icalendar-entries' to add a condition:
only print entries which don't match a regexp (only interesting part is past):

<pre>
        (when (not (string-match my-org-ical-exclude hd))
          (princ (format "BEGIN:VEVENT
%s
%s
SUMMARY:%s
END:VEVENT\n"
                         (org-ical-ts-to-string ts "DTSTART")
                         (org-ical-ts-to-string ts2 "DTEND" inc)
                         hd)))

(setq my-org-ical-exclude "\\(TO-PLAN\\|WAITING\\|DONE\\)")
</pre>

May be a better way to do this is to have special #+ICAL_EXCLUDE/#+ICAL_INCLUDE ?

Regards.

[new:StefanKamphausen:2007-10-11 12:21 UTC]  Are there any plans to integrate OrgMode with Oddmuse and OddmuseMode?  I'm planning to start planning using OrgMode but since I collaborate with co-workers I need something bidirectional.  The files in ~/org are not.  But since I'm also evaluating OddmuseMode I thought a combination might be a very good idea.  You immediately gain published plans.  One would have to write a modul for Oddmuse, obviously, to understand the special markup.  In this the user-defined keywords from OrgMode might be placed onto a specially named page.

Well, this is just brainstorming and since I didn't actually ''use'' OrgMode for anything yet I might be talking rubbish.  But it sounds good to me.  --StefanKamphausen

[new]
For somebody like me, it would be far easier to add Org Mode's markup rules to Oddmuse as a module. Then you could just use org-mode to write and oddmuse-mode to post. -- AlexSchroeder

[new]
I envision a work-cycle like this:

* M-x oddmuse-edit (Wiki, Page) (instead of find-file)
* auto-mode-alist decides to put this in OrgMode
* OrgMode-editing
* M-x oddmuse-post  (instead of save-buffer)
* Then an oddmuse-org-mode-markup-Modul takes care of the rendering.

There are however some details, like the user-defined keywords in OrgMode and probably lots of other stuff that I don't know about yet.  Features like integration of OddMuse's blogging setup and calender-extension could be really neat. Ah, and HTML-checkboxes and JavaScript-Tree-Views and ... oh sorry ;-) -- StefanKamphausen

[new]
How does one implement this in Org? I have a library book that needs to be returned, but i don't want it showing up in my things to do until 3 days before it is due. In HowmMode (which I currently use) I would simply set the a deadline with advance notice to 3 and I'm done. -- PeterMielke

[new]
Is this what you want ?

    You can specify a different lead time for warnings for a specific
    deadlines using the following syntax.  Here is an example with a
    warning period of 5 days `DEADLINE: <2004-02-29 Sun -5d>'

=== Local TODO list? ===

I see org has a global todo list which shows todo items from every
agenda files. Is there a todo list command which shows todo items only
from the current file in the same agenda buffer format as the global
todo list?

[new]
Yes. There are many ways to do this.

1. You can use "<" to restrict the TODO list to the current buffer or
"<<" to restrict it to the current headline.

2. You can add a filetag at the top of the file and then filter the
TODO list by tag using "/".

3. You can write a custom agenda command that uses a different value
for org-agenda-files. See
http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-custom-agenda-commands.php.

-- MattLundin

[new]

Thanks. It seems I have lot to learn about org-mode. :)

Before I saw your answer I came up with an other solution which fits my current approach, since at the moment I use files for context, so I always want buffer restricted todo lists:

<pre>
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'my-org-mode-stuff)

(defun my-org-mode-stuff ()
  (local-set-key (kbd "<f12>")
                 (lambda (arg)
                   (interactive "P")
                   (let ((org-agenda-files (list (buffer-file-name))))
                       (org-todo-list arg))))
   ...
)
</pre>


If I start to use more org features I may switch to one of the methods you listed. Thanks again.


[new]

After a good nights sleep using the info you gave me I came up with an other solution which is less hackish, since it uses the regular user interface and it pushes the necessary keys automatically to show a buffer restricted todo list:

<pre>
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'my-org-mode-stuff)

(defun my-org-mode-stuff ()
  (local-set-key (kbd "<f12>")
                 (lambda ()
                   (interactive)
                   (push ?t unread-command-events)
                   (push ?< unread-command-events)
                   (call-interactively 'org-agenda)))
   ...
)
</pre>


This is better than the previous one, because the agenda buffer shows the proper list even after a refresh. The previous solution showed the global todo list in that case.

I recently had to calculate the differences between log file timestamps.  Eventually I figured out how to do this with emacs calc mode, and put the results together in org-mode spreadsheet tables. Here's my [http://www.hollenback.net/index.php/EmacsOrgTimestamps writeup on emacs, calc, org-mode, and timestamps].

Agree, org-mode ".org" export to MoinMoin ".wiki" format would be fantastic.  I don't think the original request was made clearly enough, I am just reiterating that there is a need.
