flex and bison files are apparently supported by cc-mode.

(DEAD LINK as of Sept 2004) There is a flex-mode.el to be found here: http://www.eecs.tulane.edu/www/Beuscher/emacs/elisp.html#flex-mode.el

(note: this file is available at archive.org, just type the address and press the wayback machine button)

I have a copy, but I'm not sure about uploading it.  There is no licence statement.

That is very unfortunate, because then we cannot distribute it.  Does it have an email address or something?  The upload script will only accept free software, too.

The link works now, so I guess this is no longer needed.
* Actually the link above works, but the important one which is in that page and points to the .el file does not as of 2005-04-05.

See also BisonMode.
