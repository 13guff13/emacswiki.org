This page is about library '''<tt>[[highlight-fns.el]]</tt>''', which lets you highlight function calls in EmacsLisp code.

== How to Use ==

Command '''`highlight-lisp-fns-mode'''' is a [[minor mode]] command that toggles highlighting function calls in EmacsLisp code in the current buffer.

The highlighting uses [[face]] `highlight-lisp-fns', which by default inherits from face `font-lock-constant-face'.  

To use the command, put this in your [[init file]]:

    (require 'highlight-fns)

If you want to turn on this highlighting automatically for Emacs-Lisp mode, then put this in your init file after requiring the library:

    (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'highlight-lisp-fns-mode
              'APPEND)

You can use the command to toggle it off at any time.




== Limitations ==

The names of known EmacsLisp functions are highlighted.  This is so even if
some occurrence of the name is not used for a function.  For example, it might be used as a variable name:

     ;; `setq' is a variable here, but it is highlighted anyway.
     (let ((setq  (foobar)))...)

In practice this is not a major problem, but it is good to be aware of it.
