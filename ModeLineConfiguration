The Emacs [[ModeLine|mode line]] is highly configurable, offering special modes and functions that change its functionality.

==Mode-line minor modes==
Display of some standard information in the mode line is governed by these minor modes (toggles):

* `display-time-mode' --- Enable the display of the current time with <tt>(display-time-mode 1)</tt>, see [[DisplayTime|display time]]
* `line-number-mode' --- Enable or disable the display of the current line number, see [[ModeLinePosition|mode-line position]], [[LineNumbers|line numbers]]
* `column-number-mode' --- Enable or disable the display of the current column number, see [[ModeLinePosition|mode-line position]]
* `size-indication-mode' (for Emacs 22 and up) --- Enable or disable the current buffer size, see [[ModeLinePosition|mode-line position]]
* `display-battery-mode' (for Emacs 22 and up) --- Enable or disable laptop battery information (%%supports GNU/Linux APM, ACPI, Mac OS X 10.3.x, FreeBSD and OpenBSD%%).

==Mode-line enhancements== 
Here are particular enhancements to the mode line:

* ModeLineMinorModeMenu --- Pop up minor-mode menus from the mode-line.
* ModeLinePosition --- Display region size if region is active (in TransientMarkMode) and highlights the column number if greater than `modelinepos-column-limit'.  
* ModeLinePosAtBeginning --- Display line and column numbers at the start of the mode line, so they are visible even when the TextCursor is inside a function with a long name.
* HideModeLine --- Save screen real estate by hiding the mode line.
* LunarModeLine --- Display current lunar phase in the modeline.
* ModeLineDirtrack --- show the buffer's current directory in the mode-line.
* SmlModeLine --- Indicate in the mode-line, in a scrollbar-like way, the portion of the buffer that is visible in the window.
* ShowPointMode --- Show value of point in the mode-line.
