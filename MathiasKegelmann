I use Emacs, which I prefer, on Linux and Windows but I can use vi when I have to (and I don't mind ;) )

GNU/Linux is my operating system of choice: I use Gentoo and Debian.

I use MuseMode, PlannerMode and RememberMode trying to get organized, and ViewMail as my mail reader on Linux.

For VC I use git and svn.

Wiki Pages: Lisp:mogo.el: a GoMode for !MoGo which I maintain

Personal email: the obvious ##gmail## email adress
