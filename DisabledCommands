To protect newbie users from lossage, some Emacs commands are disabled
by default due to their potentially destructive nature.  When one tries
to execute such a command, Emacs will ask you if you really want to do
that and offer to un-disable it by putting a form like below in your
InitFile.

 (put 'some-disabled-command 'disabled nil)

To enable all disabled commands in one fell swoop, put this in your
InitFile.  This is not recommended for newbies.

 (setq disabled-command-hook nil)
