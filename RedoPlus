redo.el provides a linear undo/redo system which is easy to understand for many people. However, redo.el is out-of-date and often destroys the contents of buffer because the behavior of `primitive-undo' has been slightly different from old one since Emacs 22. redo+.el is a fork of redo.el and correctly works in newer version of Emacs. This program also adds items to menubar/toolbar.

== Downloading ==

* Lisp:redo+.el
* [http://www11.atwiki.jp/s-irie/pages/18.html Web site (in Japanese)]

== Installation ==

To use redo+.el, save this file in a directory listed in load-path and add the following to your ~/.emacs:

  (require 'redo+)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-?") 'redo)

If you'd like to discard the old undo branch immediately, put an additional line as:

  (setq undo-no-redo t)

Have fun!
