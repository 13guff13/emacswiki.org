=== Emacswiki version ===

Lisp:powerline.el was first released here on the Emacswiki by Nicolas Rougier and later improved by Chen Yuan.

I have rewritten this package and am hosting the repository on Github.  My version uses many of the techniques in the original---posted here---but tries to make it easier to add new things.  Please submit issues there and any of your own mode-line themes using PowerLine --DonaldCurtis

=== Jonathan Chu's version ===
