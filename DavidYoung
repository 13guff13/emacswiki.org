= About me =

I use Emacs.

This is some Emacs extensive functions I wrote in my daily work.

Lisp:dove-ext.el

= Describe the code now =

== matrixSum == 

Calculate matrix statistics by row & column. Then insert result into current buffer.
Calculation is doing from a predefined shell script named as 'matrixSum'

== come-here ==

Bring content from specific buffer to current buffer. 

== jump ==

Take the command at point, jump to another window and paste it to the point over there.

== some ==

Delete all output from interpreter since the one before the last input. Because comint-delete-output just could not do it for you.

== exitshell ==

Exit from recursive shell logins automatically.

== rename-buffer-in-ssh-login ==

Rename buffer to the destination hostname in ssh login

== kill-shell-buffer-after-exit ==

Kill shell buffer after exit from shell process.

== split-window-4 ==

This function splits frame into 4 windows, like following.
{{{
  +-----------------------+----------------------+
  |                       |                      |
  |                       |                      |
  |                       |                      |
  +-----------------------+----------------------+
  |                       |                      |
  |                       |                      |
  |                       |                      |

I used to run shell mode in these windows.

== split-v ==

This function change window from vertical style into horizontal style

{{{

  |                      |           /     |            |           | 
  |                      |                 |            |           |

Welcome to the wiki. -- DrewAdams

Thanks for your kind greeting. You're so fast. BTW, can you advise me how to make the Lisp:dove-ext.el page becomes a download-able lisp file? I tried many times but always fail. -- DavidYoung

[new:DrewAdams:2010-07-31 16:34 UTC]
Looks to me like you succeeded. -- DrewAdams

[new]
I succeed when I pasted lisp code on the page directly, instead of replace that page with code file.  -- DavidYoung

[new:DrewAdams:2010-08-01 14:01 UTC]
Right. -- DrewAdams
