Thanks for your kind greeting. You're so fast. BTW, can you advise me how to make the Lisp:dove-ext.el page becomes a download-able lisp file? I tried many times but always fail. -- DavidYoung

Looks to me like you succeeded. -- DrewAdams

I succeed when I pasted lisp code on the page directly, instead of replace that page with code file.  -- DavidYoung
