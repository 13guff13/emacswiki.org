[http://www.mulgasoft.com/emacsplus Emacs+] is an Eclipse plug in by MarkFeber designed to provide a more Emacs like experience in the Eclipse text editors.  Some of the major features are listed below.  In cases where the normal Emacs binding interferes with the default eclipse binding, the Emacs binding is preferred.

* M-x command execution
* Emacs style text selection
* Emacs style search and query/replace with sub-command support
* A kill ring for deleted text
* Balanced expression (s-expression) commands
* Split editor windows via keystrokes
* Tags search (//without tags//)
* Transposition of characters, words, lines and s-expressions
* Simple text manipulation commands
* For the Java editor, end of line comment operations
* Numerous convenience bindings of core Eclipse commands to the Emacs /standard/ are also provided.
