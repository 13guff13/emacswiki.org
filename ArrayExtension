This package by DavidBakhash provides multidimensional arrays
simulated in EmacsLisp.  Using it, you can do MatrixOperations, for
example.  Or you could use the AdvancedDeskCalculator.

* Groups:cl-array.el -- the replacement for multi.el
* Groups:multi.el -- the old code, do not use

Note that there is another file out there called multi.el, by
BernardVauquelin.  That one does SearchAndReplace across multiple buffers.
