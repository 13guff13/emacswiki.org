= Building Aquamacs from the Git repository =

* Building Aquamacs from the development source is easy: install scripts are provided. Go ahead and tinker with Aquamacs and maybe contribute a patch or two. You're welcome to work with us!*

You'll need to have Apple's developer tools installed.

* If you don't want to build yourself: We provide daily (universal) binaries, compiled fresh from our Git master branch, which you can download.  
* Don't forget to subscribe to the [http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/aquamacs-devel aquamacs-devel mailing list]. 

== Obtaining ==

Ensure you have a recent version of Git installed.
Then:

  git clone git://github.com/davidswelt/aquamacs-emacs.git
  cd aquamacs-emacs.git

== Building ==

To build Aquamacs, ensure you have

- Apple's free Developer Tools (for make, gcc, etc.)
- The Aquamacs git repository (or a source code snapshot) as above.

Change to the source directory and just do

  ./build-aquamacs

which will result in an Aquamacs in nextstep/Aquamacs.app

The manual version: "make install", which will compile incrementally.  
Alternatively, to build Emacs and just copy the new Emacs binary into the .app bundle, you may use "make".

That's it!

== Building the Carbon-based branch (pre-2.0) ==

You may check out the latest revision of the Aquamacs22 branch, which contains the 1.7 release series:

  git checkout Aquamacs22

Then proceed with building as above; however, the resulting binary will be found in the builds/ directory.

== Switching to GNU Emacs ==

  git checkout emacs
