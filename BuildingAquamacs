= Building Aquamacs from the Git repository =

* Building Aquamacs from the development source is easy: install scripts are provided. Go ahead and tinker with Aquamacs and maybe contribute a patch or two. You're welcome to work with us!*

You'll need to have Apple's developer tools installed.

* If you don't want to build yourself: We provide daily (universal) binaries, compiled fresh from our Git master branch, which you can download.  
* Don't forget to subscribe to the [http://lists.aquamacs.org/ aquamacs-devel mailing list]. 

== Obtaining ==

Ensure you have a recent version of Git installed.
Then:

  git clone git://github.com/davidswelt/aquamacs-emacs.git
  cd aquamacs-emacs

== Building ==

To build Aquamacs, ensure you have

- Apple's free Developer Tools (for make, gcc etc.)
- Autoconf and automake are not installed by default developer tools installation, but required for this build
- The Aquamacs git repository (or a source code snapshot) as above.

Change to the source directory and just do

  ./build-aquamacs

which will result in an Aquamacs in nextstep/Aquamacs.app

The manual version: "make install", which will compile incrementally.  
Alternatively, to build Aquamacs and just copy the new Aquamacs binary into the .app bundle, you may use "make".  This will not update the Lisp files in the bundle.

That's it!

Note: the binary that you've just build will only run on your machine, with the same or better OS X version, and the same CPU architecture!

== Building the Emacs 24-based Aquamacs branch ==

You may check out the latest revision of the Aquamacs24 branch, which contains the 2.x release series combined with Emacs 24 (in development, unstable!):

  git checkout aquamacs24

Then proceed with building as above.

== Building the Carbon-based branch (pre-2.0) ==

You may check out the latest revision of the Aquamacs22 branch, which contains the 1.7 release series:

  git checkout Aquamacs22

Then proceed with building as above; however, the resulting binary will be found in the builds/ directory.

== Switching to GNU Emacs ==

  git checkout emacs
