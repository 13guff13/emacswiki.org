= XEmacs =

As of version 21.5b24 [[XEmacs]] has support for Xft fonts included (but it must be selected at build time). The release notes at http://xemacs.org/Releases/21.5.24.html have all the details. [http://blog.clemens.endorphin.org/2006/02/beautiful-xemacs.html Additional configuration suggestions] available from CFruhwirth's Weblog.

= GNU Emacs =

Support for this is in GNU Emacs version 23.1. See [[XftGnuEmacs]]. Most X systems will have sub-pixel antialiasing configured by default, but see this [http://jmason.org/howto/subpixel.html HOWTO] if you have trouble.

AquamacsEmacs (on Mac OS X) comes configured to use a range of scalable fonts with antialiasing, which are usable out-of-the box.  

== Proportional Fonts and the Fill Column==

[new] I've begun using Emacs 23 and have "prettified" my setup with beautiful, antialiased fonts. Finally I can use the world's best variable-width (proportional) text fonts with the world's best text editor -- it no longer looks like WordPerfect from 1987!

However, there's a big problem. When you use a proportional font, the fill column does not work as expected: with a monospaced font at a particular size, it's easy to determine exactly how many characters you can get across your particular display screen. Not so with a proportional font! The best you can do is estimate, usually on the conservative side, and then go with that: but you'll still get lines that have too much empty whitespace on the right, and you'll still run into situations where words will wrap. So it's not possible (as far as I know) to use a proportional font with Emacs without this very basic problem.

Does anyone know of a workaround? What I'm basically looking for is not fill-column anymore, but a way to instruct Emacs to not let text wrap to the end of line based on the size of the Emacs frame. Does anyone know if there is any development work going on to find a way to do proper line filling with proportional fonts? I'm completely stuck on this one, Google isn't helping, and I'd appreciate any info or advice. Thanks.

Newer versions of Emacs have `M-x toggle-word-wrap' that would give
you a logical word wrap based on the current rendering of the font.
The physical result is the file having long lines.  The modes `M-x
auto-fill-mode' and `M-x fill-mode' physically add newlines to the
file.  If they were font-sensitive than the filling would be silly if
the file was viewed in a different font.
