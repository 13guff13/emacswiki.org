= XEmacs =

As of version 21.5b24 [[XEmacs]] has support for Xft fonts right out of the box. The release notes at http://xemacs.org/Releases/21.5.24.html have all the details. [http://blog.clemens.endorphin.org/2006/02/beautiful-xemacs.html Additional configuration suggestions] available from CFruhwirth's Weblog.

= GNU Emacs =
Support for this is in GNU Emacs version 23.1. Quouting `NEWS.23.1':

   *** Added support for the Xft library for antialiasing.

A full list of changes can be found [http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/NEWS.23.1 here].

[new]
Emacs on GNUstep (aka EmacsOnAqua; http://emacs-on-aqua.sf.net) renders antialiased fonts on Linux/X11 via Xft.  However, this requires installing GNUstep (http://gnustep.org) and living with the older emacs-20 for now.

[new]
AquamacsEmacs (on Mac OS X) comes configured to use a range of scalable fonts with antialiasing, which are usable out-of-the box.  


Other GnuEmacs information from Chris Gray, [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.devel/19089], and see also [[XftGnuEmacs]].

There are some free True-Type or Type-1 fonts
  out there with international characters. Because the free fonts are
  rarely hinted they are not very usable on a computer
  screen. Anti-aliasing could help here. It should be an attribute of
  a [[Face]], however, since anti-aliasing is OTOH bad for the eyes. 

Although often lumped in with antialiasing (because Xft does it too...), sub-pixel rendering (a.k.a "cleartype")
  is far more important in these days of affordable LCD monitors.   This is where
  the red, green and blue subpixels are treated separately. LCD monitors
  have "ordered", predictable locations of each subpixel. Thus, sub-pixel rendering
  approximately triples the horizontal b/w resolution of the screen, and thereby sharpens, rather 
  than  blurs, fonts on LCD displays. Note that on unordered displays like most CRTs, it just
  gives "rainbow fringing". But oodles of emacs users must have laptops with LCDs! It is IMHO the subpixel
  rendering that would make Xft support in emacs worthwhile, and the sooner the better.

Keep in mind that the Xft issue is for people running X.  In Microsoft Windows, XEmacs uses Windows native font rendering, which has antialiasing and sub-pixel rendering.  It looks great.


''The  mythical GtkEmacs might do that, since GTK+ 2 does antialiased and
  truetype fonts.''  Unfortunately GtkXEmacs does not use GTK font
  rendering; it bypasses GTK and uses X directly.  

[new]
: Since the XFT [[XEmacs]] port also uses X directly--not using, say, Qt, or some other toolkit--and since the GTK X redisplay code was ripped straight from the Athena/Motif X redisplay code, where the XFT code was added, making the GTK port work with Xft would not be obscenely difficult, a couple of days' work once you're comfortable with the [[XEmacs]] build process. Unfortunately, GTK 2 integration isn't there quite yet, so GTK support for XFT would for the moment have to involve gdkxft, which is a crazy hack :-( --- AidanKehoe

One not-amazingly-satisfactory workaround until Xft support makes it into emacs: 
  Open an antialiased terminal window (e.g. kde konsole or even a correctly configured recent version of xterm), 
  and run <tt>emacs -nw</tt> in it. This will launch emacs as if it was on a non-X text-mode display,
  ignoring DISPLAY, running inside the terminal emulator window, and therefore will use the terminal emulator's 
  much better  font rendering.  If you then do <tt>M-x xterm-mouse-mode</tt> the mouse might even sort of work!

[new]
There is a non-mainstream branch of GNU emacs which supports Xft font rendering. It is called XFT_JHD_BRANCH.
  An all-personal way to build such version is as follows:

    export CVS_RSH="ssh"
    cvs -z3  -d:ext:anoncvs@savannah.gnu.org:/cvsroot/emacs co -r XFT_JHD_BRANCH emacs
    cd emacs
    ./configure --with-x-toolkit=gtk --prefix=/scratch/scarpaz/emacs-xft
    CFLAGS='-O3 -fexpensive-optimizations' make bootstrap
    make
    make install

== Proportional Fonts and the Fill Column==

[new] I've begun using Emacs 23 and have "prettified" my setup with beautiful, antialiased fonts. Finally I can use the world's best variable-width (proportional) text fonts with the world's best text editor -- it no longer looks like WordPerfect from 1987!

However, there's a big problem. When you use a proportional font, the fill column does not work as expected: with a monospaced font at a particular size, it's easy to determine exactly how many characters you can get across your particular display screen. Not so with a proportional font! The best you can do is estimate, usually on the conservative side, and then go with that: but you'll still get lines that have too much empty whitespace on the right, and you'll still run into situations where words will wrap. So it's not possible (as far as I know) to use a proportional font with Emacs without this very basic problem.

Does anyone know of a workaround? What I'm basically looking for is not fill-column anymore, but a way to instruct Emacs to not let text wrap to the end of line based on the size of the Emacs frame. Does anyone know if there is any development work going on to find a way to do proper line filling with proportional fonts? I'm completely stuck on this one, Google isn't helping, and I'd appreciate any info or advice. Thanks.

[new]
Newer versions of Emacs have `M-x toggle-word-wrap' that would give
you a logical word wrap based on the current rendering of the font.
The physical result is the file having long lines.  The modes `M-x
auto-fill-mode' and `M-x fill-mode' physically add newlines to the
file.  If they were font-sensitive than the filling would be silly if
the file was viewed in a different font.
