* An answer to the Stack Overflow question [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/350345/how-can-i-have-a-portable-emacs "How can I have a portable Emacs?"] points out that ''the "normal" Emacs distribution for Windows is precompiled and just runs without having to do any install. Just get one of the *.zip files from the usual place, unpack it onto a USB disk, and you can use it directly. (The actual binary is inside the "bin/" directory.)''
