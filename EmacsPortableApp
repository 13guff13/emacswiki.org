== Variations ==

* An answer to the Stack Overflow question [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/350345/how-can-i-have-a-portable-emacs "How can I have a portable Emacs?"] points out that ''the "normal" Emacs distribution for Windows is precompiled and just runs without having to do any install. Just get one of the *.zip files from the usual place, unpack it onto a USB disk, and you can use it directly. (The actual binary is inside the "bin/" directory.)''

Everything below here refers to one particular implementation.

== Introduction ==
!EmacsPortable.App attempts to make a portable version of Emacs that
runs off a USB drive under either Windows, Linux, or Mac OSX.

The features of this distribution:
* Automatic Registering of extensions (and org-protocol)
* Will use !LiberKey when requested (Windows)
* Will generate an appropriate Info.plist for Mac OS X
* No support under Linux
* Temporarily Install of fonts
* Temporarily install fonts on windows so you can always carry your
favorite mono-spaced font
* Copy the fonts to ~/Library/Fonts under Mac OSX
* The fonts you use should be free, so you are not copying fonts
that should not be copied
* Currently no support under Linux

== Window Only Features:* ==
* Psuedo-Daemon
* Finding support applications and dictionaries
* Starting gdb or attaching debugger
* Updating and downloading the latest emacs, even if !EmacsPortable.App
hasn't released a new launcher.

In windows, this distribution also allows concurrent versions of emacs
to be run, with different startup options.

== Download ==
=== Download for Emacs 24 ===
The following downloads are available:
* [http://code.google.com/p/emacs-portable-app/downloads/detail?name=EmacsInstall-24.3-ep13.03.22.exe Emacs 24.3]
* See http://code.google.com/p/emacs-portable-app/downloads/list for all available downloads

=== source ??? ===
* https://github.com/mlf176f2/EmacsPortable.App - under active development as of 2013.11
* http://mlf176f2.github.io/EmacsPortable.App/
** "mlf176f2" appears to be Matthew L Fiddler, who created/edited the bulk of this page, but lacks an EmacsWiki user-page

== Using Pre-releases ==
Under windows, you can do a net-install by using !EmacsOptions.  This
net install can be performed in two ways:
# Select the option for a network-based install
# Move the <tt>!EmacsOptions.exe</tt> outside of the !EmacsPortableApp
directory and run it.  This allows you to distribute the network
install file anywhere and allow other people to download/build
their own !EmacsPortable.App.


== Options ==
=== Associations ===
!EmacsPortable.App handles file associations in the following ways:

* Associations through !LiberKey
* !PortableApps.com specifictaion (when !PortableApps supports association)
* Registering Associations when running.

When changing associations under windows, the Mac <tt>Info.plist</tt> xml
file is also updated.

In addition to regular extensions, !EmacsPortable.App can be registered
to extensionless files.  Currently this is unsupported through
liberkey.  Therefore, this is only in effect when !EmacsPortableApp is
running or installed locally.

=== Proxy ===
This allows proxy settings to be dynamically determined based on your
location.  Your password is encrypted based on the location as well.
This works on windows only.

!EmacsPortable.App will setup the <tt>HTTPS_PROXY</tt>, <tt>HTTP_PROXY</tt> and
<tt>FTP_PROXY</tt> based on the connection specific setup.
To use a proxy, set it up with <tt>!EmacsOptions.exe</tt>.

This is sufficient for some packages, but not for <tt>gnus</tt>.

The information is stored by the blowfish encryption algorithm.
However the <tt>HTTP_PROXY</tt> environment variable will contain the
password in clear text.

When Putty Key is specified in this dialog, the putty key is loaded
and Putty local or portable is started (depending on the options selected).
=== Behavior ===
Under windows, launching options may be changed by running
<tt>!EmacsOptions.exe</tt>. Otherwise, ini files can be edited on Mac OSX.
==== Launching Options  ====
==== Emacs Version ====
This selects the version of Emacs that !EmacsPortable.App will be
running.  This is useful if you run different versions of Emacs to
test lisp code on multiple emacs versions.
==== Startup Script ====
Emacs allows you to select popular startup scripts for emacs startup.
Once downloaded, you can use:
* Prelude
* Emacs 24 Starter Kit
* Ergoemacs
* Kicker

You can also create  you own.  Just place an <tt>init.el</tt> or <tt>.emacs</tt> in
a directory under <tt>Data/startup/</tt>

==== Pseudo Daemon ====
The Pseudo-Daemon Start-up script among other things:
* Opens Emacs
* Renames the current Frame
* Creates a New frame
* Calls an external program (ahk) that hides the frame & puts an
Emacs icon in the task bar to allow this frame to be shown or
closed
* Once Emacs has started up, subsequent calls to the Emacs start-up
script open a new frame.

This allows you to "close" out of Emacs while maintaining a running Emacs.

The startup script also sets the environment variable
EMACS_SERVER_FILE to the temporary directory

<tt>$TEMP\ep\!EmacsPortable.App-Server-$EMACS_VERSION\server</tt>

Subsequent calls to emacsclient.exe specify this server location.
Therefore an emacs server can be run for each distinct emacs version

More information about the startup is found in site-start.org
==== New frame on file open ====
Create a new emacs "frame" on opening a new file.
==== Debug startup ====
Under windows, debug mode starts <tt>gdb</tt> if found.  Additionally, if
<tt>App/gdbinit</tt> is found, gdb sources this before running emacs.  You
can download an appropriate gdbinit for emacs [http://bzr.savannah.gnu.org/lh/emacs/trunk/annotate/head:/src/.gdbinit here].

This is equivalent to using <tt>!EmacsDebug.exe</tt>
==== Unzip binaries and run from temporary directory ====
Emacs binaries can be zipped to save space.  This requires that the
emacs binaries are extracted to the temporary directory before
running.  I have found that running emacs in this manner is faster
than running it on the USB stick alone.  If not selected the binaries
will run from the usb drive.  If you are running !EmacsPortable.App locally
==== Clean residual files ====
When running portably, the unzipped binaries are stored in the
temporary directory.  To save time on startup, if the bare binaries
needed to run emacs are still present, the launcher uses these files
in the temporary directory.

When the clean residual files option is selected, these binaries are
removed after emacs stops, otherwise they are retained to improve
startup time. 
==== Home directory ====
The <tt>HOME</tt> Directory is where Emacs stores the <tt>.emacs</tt> file;  Other
emacs programs also store information here. !EmacsPortable.App has a
few options for home directories

== EXEDIR Alias* ==

If the <tt>Data/ini/!EmacsPortableApp.ini</tt> file contains an ini Home Entry 
<pre>
  [EmacsPortableApp]
  Home=EXEDIR:/Data/Home
</pre>
The EXEDIR directory is changed for the base directory that
!EmacsPortable.App is run from.

The advantage to this methodology is that you can drag and drop Emacs
and all your customizations will be dragged with it.

== USB Alias* ==

If the <tt>Data/ini/!EmacsPortableApp.ini</tt> file contains an ini Home Entry 
<pre>
  [EmacsPortableApp]
  Home=USB:/Documents/
</pre>
USB represents the USB directory. This setting uses the !PortableApps Documents Directory
as the home-directory.  

The USB directory is determined as follows:
* /Under Windows/
* Checks each removable and hard drive for an <tt>.emacs</tt> or <tt>_emacs</tt>
file under the specified directory.  For example
!EmacsPortable.App would check <tt>e:\Documents\.emacs</tt> and
<tt>f:\Document\.emacs</tt>.  If it found <tt>f:\Document\.emacs</tt>, If it
exists, it assumes that the USB drive is <tt>f:\</tt>
* Checks each drive for a <tt>!PortableApps</tt> directory.  If found it
assumes that this is the usb drive
* Checks for <tt>Apps</tt>,<tt>!EmacsPortable.App</tt> or <tt>!PortableApps</tt>,
<tt>!LiberKey\Apps</tt>, etc (the directories found in App/paths.ini
portable.dirs). When found, !EmacsPortable.App assumes the drive
where the directory is found is the USB drive.
* If not found, it will set the USB directory to the installed directory.
* /Under Mac OS X/
* Assumes the usb directory is the <tt>/Volumes/USB-NAME/</tt> directory.

The advantage of this methodology is that under windows, Emacs can be
copied to the hard-drive to speed up the run-time, and the
initialization from the hard drive. 

== Home if Exists* ==

If the <tt>Data/ini/!EmacsPortableApp.ini</tt> file contains a full path, then
the home is set when that file exists.  For example:
<pre>
  [EmacsPortableApp]
  Home=c:\
</pre>

will set the home directory to <tt>c:\</tt> on Windows computers.  Currently,
this is supported only on windows.

== System home* ==

If the <tt>Data/ini/!EmacsPortableApp.ini</tt> file contains an ini Home Entry
that doesn't start with either <tt>EXEDIR:/</tt> or <tt>USB:/</tt>, and doesn't
exist then the
original home directory is maintained.
<pre>
  [EmacsPortableApp]
  Home=Set as original
</pre>

== Changing Home* ==

When using !EmacsOptions.exe, you do not have to worry about selecting
which type of file is used.  If you select a directory on the USB
drive, the !EmacsPortableApp is updated accordingly.  If you select
location within the portable app directory, the <tt>EXEDIR</tt> is replaced.
Note that any where else may change depending on the computer you use.


==== Integration Options ====
==== Right-Click "Edit-With" ====
This allows a right click to produce a "Edit with !EmacsPortable.App"
==== Org-protocol ====
This registers Org-protocol and also associates org-protocol actions
with adobe acrobat/adobe acrobat reader.
==== Liberkey ====
!EmacsPortable.App will add !LiberKey File associations when it locates
!LiberKey, and the !LiberKey support is checked.  Note that you should
restart !LiberKey and make sure that the associations actually
installed correctly.
=== Visual ===
This allows the initial font/color and gemoetry options to be
specified so that emacs will startup with these options enabled.


These are called from the command line and do not affect the
registry.

In addition this tries to set an option to maximize new frames.
=== Download ===
!EmacsPortable.App can download and run the versions of Emacs from the
mac repository and windows repository and package them so they work
with the !EmacsPortable.App launcher.

If the !EmacsOptions list of emacs versions is out of date, it can be
updated by the following procedure:
* Start !EmacsPortable.App
* Type <tt>M-x official-emacs</tt>

This will update the emacs list of official binaries from [[http://emacsformacosx.com/][GNU Emacs
For Mac OS X]] and [http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/ GNU Emacs] websites.


=== Network Install ===
=== Build Launcher ===
=== Unix Components ===
== Customizing ==
=== Startup Customization ===
The <tt>!EmacsOptions.exe</tt> allows you to set Emacs startup options via a
GUI.  This is mirrored in the <tt>Data/ini/!EmacsPortable.ini</tt> file. 

=== Setting Startup Environment variables ===
By creating or editing an environment ini file at
<tt>Data/ini/Environment.ini</tt>, startup environmental variables may be set.
For example, if you use the <tt>colemak</tt> keyboard with the ergoemacs
package, the following ini-file will set the
<tt>ERGOEMACS_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT</tt> to the proper value

<pre>
[Environment]
ERGOEMACS_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT=colemak
</pre>

=== Load Path ===
Load Path for source directory is in <tt>Data/src</tt>.
=== Literate Initialization ===
When using !EmacsPortable.App's startup mechanism, t
# Any <tt>.org</tt>, <tt>.el</tt> or <tt>.elc</tt> files in <tt>Data/init</tt> and loads them
# User-based <tt>.org</tt>, <tt>.el</tt>, or <tt>.elc</tt> files in <tt>Data/init/user</tt>.   
# System based <tt>.org</tt>, <tt>.el</tt> or <tt>.elc</tt> files in <tt>Data/init/system</tt>.

== Configuration ==
Since !EmacsPortable.App tries to run portably, there are a few things
that are changed from a standard emacs distribution:

# Home directory is allowed to change based on different computers
(USB is e:, f:, etc)

# Directories that change can become aliases for convenience and to
allow recent files to save correctly (for instance ~usb for the usb
drive).

# Install fonts on different computers to allow a favorite font to be
used in emacs for all distributions.  In windows this is done by
making the font available to windows during the session.
=== Emacs aliases ===
Emacs has a list of "home" directory aliases.  The absolute
directories are:
|| Alias       || True Directory               || Directory Purpose                   ||
|| ~ahk/       || Other/source/ahk             || AHK Sources Directory               ||
|| ~app/       || App/                         || !EmacsPortable.App Application Files ||
|| ~doc/       || USB Drive Documents          || Documents Directory                 ||
|| ~ep/        || .                            || !EmacsPortable.App Directory         ||
|| ~h/         || System Home Directory        || System Home Directory               ||
|| ~ini/       || Data/ini                     || !EmacsPortable.App ini files         ||
|| ~nsi/       || Other/source/nsi             || NSIS Sources Directory              ||
|| ~pa/        || USB Drive:/!PortableApps      || Portable Apps                       ||
|| ~shared/    || Data/start/shared            || Shared Customizations               ||
|| ~site-lisp/ || App/site-lisp                || Site Lisp Directory                 ||
|| ~src/       || Data/src                     || !EmacsPortable.App lisp source files ||
|| ~start/     || Data/start                   || !EmacsPortable.App Customizations    ||
|| ~system/    || Data/start/system            || System-based Customizations         ||
|| ~usb/       || USB Drive                    || USB Drive                           ||
|| ~user/      || Data/start/user              || User-based Customizations           ||


Other aliases are added <tt>~el-get/package/elpa</tt> is changed to <tt>~elpa</tt>, as
if it were a symbolic link.  Since symbolic links are not supported in
windows, this is handled by emacs only.  This was implemented to allow
files to remain the same between file systems.  <tt>~usb/</tt> will be the
same on every system.

In addition to these aliases, the following aliases are also defined:

* <tt>~el-get</tt>, is an alias for the el-get package directory
* <tt>~elpa</tt>, is an alias for the user elpa package directory
* <tt>~theme</tt> or <tt>~themes</tt>, is an alias for the emacs24 themes directory,
(as long as the themes directory is /not/ the <tt>user-emacs-directory</tt>).
* <tt>~snip</tt>, <tt>~snips</tt>, <tt>~snippets</tt>, <tt>~snippet</tt>, is an alias for
yasnippets snippets.
* All the startup scripts in <tt>Data/start</tt> have an alias created for them.

Custom aliases may be added by customizing <tt>!EmacsPortable-aliases</tt>.

=== Font installation ===
Will install specific fonts, if needed.
=== Updating mirrors to the latest version of emacs ===
You can update the current list of supported emacs versions by
running <tt>emacs-portable-update-offical-emacs-releases</tt>.
== How It Works ==
=== Fonts ===
==== Windows ====
Under windows the fonts in the <tt>App/fonts/</tt> directory are temporarily
installed/registered. Once Emacs Exits, the fonts are unregistered.
==== Mac OS X ====
Copies fonts in the <tt>App/fonts/</tt> directory to <tt>~/Library/Fonts/</tt>
=== DOS Version ===
The dos version starts up emacs in a dos command prompt window. When
trying to do anything with the <tt>!EmacsPortableDOS</tt> command, it will
attempt to do that command in the initial <tt>DOS</tt> box.  This is just a
test environment, and is likely not very reasonable to use.
=== Icons ===
