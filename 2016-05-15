Apparently the language setup has been broken for a while and nobody noticed. I guess that means most people use Emacs Wiki and aren't surprised to see the English SiteMap instead of their preferred language site map. Well, I've fixed the bug and so if you notice anything that's off, let me know and leave a comment. -- [[Alex Schroeder]]
