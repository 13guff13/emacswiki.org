Emacs planet is huge. Modes are created everyday or so but there are
also big hits going into anonymous death.

I propose to list here any mode that users liked and that suddenly
disapeared (no more maintainer, ...).

The main goal is to have in front of each one the name of a new
volunteer.

= The list =

* RecordsMode - XavierMaillard is offering maintainership
* OrganizerMode
* YourModeGoesHere

== OrganizerMode ==

I tried to get rid of the Buffer-* functions and replaced it by a
simpler method invoking `read-file-name'. This works but many orther
functions won't work anymore. Anyway, that will let other start using
this mode and maybe adopt it :)

== Comments ==

* The name of this wiki page may be misleading; I thought that there is abandonned-mode.  It should be renamed as ListOfAbandonnedModes etc, shouldn't it?
* Also, I think it is spelt "abandoned".
