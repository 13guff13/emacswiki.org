Kai is one of the uber-lispers.  He's very active on various emacs mailing list and news groups.  He's quick to lend a hand and patient with explanations.  -- DougAlcorn

He uses Emacs.

One of the things you'll find there is TrampMode (formerly rcp.el).

Also, he's written the IndentationTutorial, a precursor to the GnusTutorial, and others.

He's great fun to talk to on the #emacs irc channel as well -- ShaeErisson

I like him too -- artist

He rules. Also, he posted his ~/.viper[http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=vafr8g3wllt.fsf%40lucy.cs.uni-dortmund.de&output=gplain] file to comp.emacs the other day.

He also did nnir.el.
