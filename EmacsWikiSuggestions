== Content Fixes ==

The emacs wiki content could use some refactoring and updating, especially if some snarky blog entries and reddit postings/comments are to be believed.  I can see 2 main ways to handle this: a top down approach (like Wikipedias "wiki projects") and a bottom up approach where wikizens can pick an individual page from a hit-list and work from there. To try and get this ball rolling, I have started up an EmacsWikiContent page. --JonathanArkell

== Includes == 

One of the things about media wiki that is decent, is the ability to set up a different wiki page as a sub-page for includes.  This is especially helpful for marking certain pages as out-of-date, requiring refactoring, candidates for deletion, or wiki projects.  I don't think it has to be very complicated to start, just some simple way to include the text from one wikipage in another, and a way to list any pages that have that include.  (This is particularly handy for getting a list of pages that have out-of-date content).  Things like a separate namespace for templates, template variables, etc can come later.

== Be Able To Specify Which Manual, for `Manual:' Links ==

I recently added a glossary entry for `macro'.  I added this link: Manual:macros.  Unfortunately, there is also a `macros' page in the CC mode manual, so this link sends you to a page where you need to pick from the two manuals.  The choice will not be obvious to a newbie.

It would be good to be able to somehow specify the manual: `(elisp)'. E.g. ##[[Manual (elisp):macros]]## or some such.  Being able to specify more than one manual would be a nice-to-have (without it one would just create multiple links). -- DrewAdams

== User Names on RecentChanges Page ==

It would be good if user names were treated normally at RecentChanges, that is, to show a non-existant page like a non-existant page is usually shown. People might be encouraged to follow it and create a home page.

[new]
I haven't thought about this in a long time. Maybe you're right. -- AlexSchroeder

== Keep more revisions of each page ==

The history for a page should show several revisions. Currently, past revisions are removed eventually. In the worst case, this leaves exactly one revision. Even if the _diff_ at the bottom of a page continues to show the diff between the no longer extant last revision and the current revision, some more information would be helpful.

[new]
I've never had a need for this. I'll leave the suggestion standing. Perhaps more people want to support this? On the other hand,
I could add a link to the [[SVN repository]]. What do you think of that? Eg. the history for AlexSchroeder would also contain a link to
http://svn.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/emacswikipages/AlexSchroeder?root=emacswiki -- AlexSchroeder


== Layout ==

=== Edit Page ==

What about moving the "Please make sure..." text, plus the Username field above the text-input editing box? That would reduce the need to scroll the page by placing the Save and Preview buttons closer to the editing box (using Preview more than once while editing is common). In fact, it would be great if those two buttons could be on the same line as the "This change is a minor edit" check box, making them even closer to the edit box. -- DrewAdams

[new]
At the time I did this on purpose to make sure people read the blurb... :/

As for hitting Preview a lot: The access key should be P, so try M-p or C-p in your browser.

Other than that, if you have a CSS-based suggestion, we can try it out.
-- AlexSchroeder


=== Keys ===

[new]
Adding some style changes to break out &lt;code&gt; from the surrounding text would be very helpful for key strokes.  Especially if they are something like '<code>C-x (</code>' which is used for starting a keyboard macro. -- DocWhat

[new]
Do you mean in addition to using a monospaced font, something like a light gray background?
Alternatively, the weird accents-used-as-apostrophes such as `C-x C-c' usually work.
Unfortunately, the regular expression used prevents `C-x (' from working. :(

The particular regular expressions used, straight from the Perl code:

  if (/\G(\`|‘)([CM][- ][- A-Za-z0-9<>;:#]+)(\'|’)/cg
      or /\G(\`|‘)([-A-Za-z0-9\/\*]+[=]?)(\'|’)/cg) {
    return $q->code('&#x2018;' . $2 . '&#x2019;');
  }

Any suggestions for improvement? It would obviously be easy to style these occurrences.
But how?
-- AlexSchroeder

== Please write a summary ==

2007-08-12

* Without any comment at the summary the feed is absolute useless. Please consider writing a short but informative summary for your changes.

* I think it is quite helpful to know when an information was written. Every comment should have a date in front of.

* Most informations are useless for emacs beginners because the article is starting with a high assumption. Therefore there should be a standard layout for emacs modes like 1. what is it good for? 2. what i need to run it? 3. how could it get started? 4. which should be the minimum configuration? 5. everything else a geek have to know.

[new:AlexSchroeder:2007-08-12 08:19 UTC]
The situation is just the same on RecentChanges. I find that in terms of peer review, the author is usually more important than the summary; unknown authors have a higher chance of being checked by me. Unfortunately most feed readers do not support the RSS 2.0 WikiModule. Perhaps many people subscribe to the full feed including diff. That would be a good way to check out what has changed regardless of summary. If you're really desperate, you could try the [http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs?action=rss;full=1;page=0;diff=1 RSS feed with diff but without page content]...

As for time stamps: Aren't we aiming for "timeless" information? At least as far as Emacs releases go. We will have people running Emacs 22 for a decade now, for all I know. Old information is not necessarily useless, so putting dates on ordinary pages can be misleading as well. The only time a time stamp makes sense is when you're putting personal thoughts on a page -- like this conversation, for example. But a wiki can be something between a FAQ and a manual, and neither has time stamps.

When it comes to page content, I guess you're right. We're somewhere between the FAQ (but there aren't many frequently asked questions), and an extension of the ElispManual. We're certainly not the manual itself.

== Drew Adams' Libraries == 

Drew I respect your work and all that you've done with Emac and on EmacsWiki. However, PLEASE can a emacswiki pages be required by sanction to be limited to only 1 (One!) reference to instances of Drew's libraries, and then *ONLY* after other relevant examples, code, etc. pertinent to the a pages context. This site is *SERIOUSLY* limited by Drew's spam and suffers because of it to the extent that it is becoming unusable because of the superfluous `Icicles.*' references strewn about.  There is a point at which the entire Emacs community suffers because of Drew's insistence on xrefs to anything remotely related to his libraries. -- mon_key

[new]
The wiki encourages people to post their own code, and to cross-references pages, and by extension, people will cross reference their own code wherever it seems appropriate. If nobody else is as prolific, then that's hardly Drew's fault. On the contrary, *I wish other people would add more crossreferences.*

There's also a philosophical point, here. How is Drew's code different from other people's code? The only thing I see is that his code is not part of Emacs. But the wiki was created to enable just that: *Hosting code and documentation that is not part of Emacs.* There will always be forces that move the wiki in some direction, and it's ok to support particular goals. In fact it's ok to not like Drew's contributions. But the correct response is to make something better. Add crossreferences to even better pages. Make the crossreferences themselves better by commenting them and saying what the referenced library does and whether it does it well. Be constructive. Help build a better wiki by integrating other people's work instead of preventing them from contributing just because you don't agree with their point of view.

I have trouble understanding how this site is "bold-caps-seriously" limited by Drew's contributions, and how his contributions can in all honesty be called "spam". The tone of the complaint makes it hard for me to take it seriously, even though I tried to give as straight an answer as I could.

Also, you might consider not complaining anonymously.

-- AlexSchroeder

[new]
I've added a sig, now its not anonymous. I _hope_ I do my best to try and contribute constructively and to make judicious commenting on libraries and xrefs. That said, I tend to put them in my source which seems like a reasonable way to voice support for particular authors, goals, pkgs etc. You are correct, and I agree, the matter is a bit of a philosophical point. If everyone xrefd with Drew's zeal as a philosophical matter I personally think the site would suffer, obv. YMMV. As I say, I truly do respect what Drew has done w/ Icicles; this doesn't make it OK to splatter it about at the vaguest possible connection. FWIW there is a search bar, it is quite useful and I'm surprised sometimes by how readily it will point _me_ to what _I_ am looking for.  -- mon_key

[new]
Maybe the problem is that Drew's libraries can be monolithic, [[Icicles]] in particular; There is some great stuff in [[Icicles]] but I don't want it all.
That said, I don't find his cross-referencing excessive. --CH

== CSS (headers, printing) ==

[new]
For some ideas on print style sheets, see [http://alistapart.com/articles/goingtoprint/ Eric Meyer's article on A List Apart]. One particularly nice idea shows how to display the URL with hyperlinked text, which would be handy here.
--AmyYoung

[new]
What exactly should we do? -- AlexSchroeder

[new]
Could we go back to the situation where in default CSS the rendering of different headers level differ only in the font size (but do differ) down until last HTML header level? -- JakubNarebski

[new]
Not unless more people support this since I don't like it. -- AlexSchroeder

[new]
In graphical browsers second-level headers currently are the same size as regular text, just italic.  This does not standout at all, making them bold would be much better in my eyes.  For example I just added a page with a long list of code snippets at the end. I reorganized them thematically and then added second-level headers. Boy that was less readable as before! So I had to add the horizontal lines back that I previously removed.  Ps: why do we skip = and use == instead? -- JonasBernoulli

[new]
Take a look at the [[CSS]] page. That will allow you to use your own CSS instead of relying on the default. If you write a CSS file that makes a significant improvement and convince some other long-time users of the site, I'll be happy to use it instead of what we have right now.

As to the /why/ of the current CSS: I'm happy with the look of H2 and H3 headers. I believe HTML pages should have but one H1 element -- the one at the top of the page, and I believe any page on this wiki should be written with just H2 and H3 sections and subsections. I find the need for H4 subsubsections to be a sign that the text ought to be reorganized instead. I also find horizonzal lines unnecessary except when creating the pseudo-footers separating categories and related pages from the rest of the page. It's how I interpret the suggestions given by Robert Bringhurst in his _The Elements of Typographical Style_, p. 61ff. Typographically, poise is mad of white space. Don't permit the titles to oppress the text. Use as many levels of headings as you need: no more and no fewer. There were people who didn't like the amount of whitespace I prefer, which is why I'm using the theme "with more whitespace around headers and small-caps". -- AlexSchroeder

== Click the heading to search for pages in this category / that link here ==

This bothers me similarly to the above since it just adds clutter for anyone who knows what clicking on a header does.  I would like to remove this too but this would probably not be well received.  I would suggest that this information is somehow shown on all pages but in an less intrusive way.

Maybe somewhere in the footer close to where the language links are too.  Then again this link ("Pages linking here") as well as the links to the translations can easily be missed.  Maybe both kinds should be placed somewhere more visible?  But if you do this please do so in a way that makes it easy to hide it using a style sheet.  -- JonasBernoulli
