== Add something on Felineherd ==

Somebody please add an entry for Felineherd - http://sourceforge.net/projects/felineherd/

When done, delete this suggestion. Thanks.

@epement - why don't you start up a page? Dump in the link, and whatever you think is some beginning notes. I'm not familiar with the project, so you already know far more than I do. This page is more for requests around the wiki software and setup. Content requests can go @ EmacsWikiContent. Or, you know, start up a stub and fill it with "hey, lazyweb, do your thang!" and let the wiki-magic commence.

== Talk link indicates whether page already exists ==
Could there be some sort of styling or tooltip to indicate if the talk page exists/has talk on it?
I like to browse the talk pages to see some meta-discussion.
But if it's not there, I don't want to bother clicking through.

On Pmwiki, Talk-links are followed by a question-mark if there is no page (it's the default indicator that a wiki-link does not exist). I don't actually like the question-mark.
On Wikipedia... well, I can't find an article without a talk page right now. 
No idea.

While I'm on about Talk, is there a reason that Talk asks for a users homepage-url, while other edits only ask for username?
--MichaelPaulukonis

[new]
Wikipedia makes the talk link red. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inciting_incident as of  21 September 2013 at 16:30.
-- Anon

[new]
Sure. I think there's a related question, here: Should all links to non-existing pages get "red link" instead of the question-mark?
For now, I'll see about a simple change that only affects the comment links we have right now...

Here's what I'm doing right now: If the comment link points to a comment-page that doesn't exist, the class "edit" is added but without changing it into a standard edit link (no questionmark!). Plus, if you're using the default setup with bootstrap CSS, I'm adding the "warning" [http://getbootstrap.com/css/#buttons button style], resulting in a yellow button instead of a standard yellow button for non-existing Talk pages.
What do you think?
-- AlexSchroeder

== Easy navigation from talk page back to parent ==
Pages ("parents" or "parent pages") have links to goto/create talk pages, but there's no reverse functionality on the talk pages to go back to the parent (that I can see).
This would be nice. --MichaelPaulukonis

[new]
Do you see the link at the bottom that says _Article_? If so, that's the one and perhaps it could use some further highlighting. If you don't, then that's a bug. -- AlexSchroeder

[new:MichaelPaulukonis:2013-05-08 13:16 UTC]
Ah! '''NOW''' I see it. I'd probably like both of them up top, next to the page name. When I'm on the talk page I more want to go back to the parent then to see what links to the talk page (default title-link behavior). --MichaelPaulukonis

[new]
What do you think of the change I just made? It moves the _Article_ or _Talk_ link (if any) to right after the header.

In case you're interested, I added the following to [http://emacswiki.org/emacs/emacs-bootstrap.js emacs-bootstrap.js]:

  // move article link and talk link below title
  var $link = $('a.original').add('a.comment');
  if ($link) {
    $('.header h1').after($('<p>').append($link));
  }

-- AlexSchroeder


[new:DrewAdams:2013-05-08 14:33 UTC]
I don't see it.  Then again, I don't use the bootstrap version... 

I agree that the link back to the page commented on should be much more prominent.  And the main page is not necessarily an "article".  It is sometimes a file in ElispArea, for instance. -- DrewAdams

[new:MichaelPaulukonis:2013-05-08 14:53 UTC]
I like it. I'm not going to say "love", as we've (I) have also got the two searchboxes up there. I know, I'm being finicky; I don't have a complete suggestion of how to better use the space. Something like how mediawiki (or the styling that wikipedia uses) displays the Article/Talk tabs, maybe?

On a related note, are there any keybindings for common functionality -- like edit, talk, article/parent? That would remove part of the issue with having them below/above the fold.

I agree with Drew about the "article" issue. I usually think of everything in here as a page, anyway. [for all of my caveats, I was amazed at the response time. woooh!] --MichaelPaulukonis

[new]
The name "article" is just what Wikipedia uses so it is easier to understand. There are "access keys" which might work for you but I don't know them by heart. If you use the English interface then I'd try e for edit, c for comment and a for article, perhaps? -- Alex

[new:MichaelPaulukonis:2013-05-08 18:59 UTC]
Okay, those work. I see '''e''' is documented at [[HowToEdit#accesskeys]], and '''p''' is down below here in dialog, but there's no central documentation of  them?
Where would be the best place to document ALL of these? I.E., I'll do it. --MichaelPaulukonis

[new]
There is no central documentation. They just get added ad-hoc. Let me check the source. :)

; e: edit (German: b)
; s: save
; p: preview
; f: find
; a: article
; c: comment

As for where to document them, I don't know. Probably a new page to link from HowToEdit? -- Alex

[new:MichaelPaulukonis:2013-05-10 18:31 UTC]
Say "hello!" to AccessKey --MichaelPaulukonis

== Provide alternate stylesheets ==

I would like to choose the stylesheet for EmacsWiki easily.  If Emacswiki could provide alternate stylesheets---see  [http://orgmode.org/worg/ Worg]---then I will be able to choose the theme using View->Page Style->etc menu in Firefox. -- [[115.241.16.57]]

[new:DrewAdams:2012-08-05 16:41 UTC]
Does [[CSS]] correspond to your request?  I don't use alternative stylesheets myself, but last time I tried this (years ago) it seemed to do what you are suggesting. 

(I've updated HowTo to mention page [[CSS]].) -- DrewAdams

[new]

This is how the directives on [http://Orgmode.org/worg Worg] looks like:

    <link rel="stylesheet" title="Standard" href="/worg/style/worg.css" type="text/css" />
    <link rel="alternate stylesheet" title="Zenburn" href="/worg/style/worg-zenburn.css" type="text/css" />
    <link rel="alternate stylesheet" title="Classic" href="/worg/style/worg-classic.css" type="text/css" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://orgmode.org/css/lightbox.css" type="text/css" media="screen" />

This is how it looks like on EmacsWiki pages

    <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="/emacs/wiki.css" />

Note the absence of "alternate stylesheet" attributes.  I am wondering whether such directives could be added to the site.

[new]
Given the selection we have on the [[CSS]] page, which are the themes you'd like to hard-code as alternatives? -- Alex

== User Names on RecentChanges Page ==

It would be good if user names were treated normally at RecentChanges, that is, to show a non-existant page like a non-existant page is usually shown. People might be encouraged to follow it and create a home page.

[new]
I haven't thought about this in a long time. Maybe you're right. -- AlexSchroeder

== Layout ==

=== Edit Page ==

What about moving the "Please make sure..." text, plus the Username field above the text-input editing box? That would reduce the need to scroll the page by placing the Save and Preview buttons closer to the editing box (using Preview more than once while editing is common). In fact, it would be great if those two buttons could be on the same line as the "This change is a minor edit" check box, making them even closer to the edit box. -- DrewAdams

[new]
At the time I did this on purpose to make sure people read the blurb... :/

As for hitting Preview a lot: The access key should be P, so try M-p or C-p in your browser.

Other than that, if you have a CSS-based suggestion, we can try it out.
-- AlexSchroeder


=== Keys ===

[new]
Adding some style changes to break out &lt;code&gt; from the surrounding text would be very helpful for key strokes.  Especially if they are something like '<code>C-x (</code>' which is used for starting a keyboard macro. -- DocWhat

[new]
Do you mean in addition to using a monospaced font, something like a light gray background?
Alternatively, the weird accents-used-as-apostrophes such as `C-x C-c' usually work.
Unfortunately, the regular expression used prevents `C-x (' from working. :(

The particular regular expressions used, straight from the Perl code:

  if (/\G(\`|‘)([CM][- ][- A-Za-z0-9<>;:#]+)(\'|’)/cg
      or /\G(\`|‘)([-A-Za-z0-9\/\*]+[=]?)(\'|’)/cg) {
    return $q->code('&#x2018;' . $2 . '&#x2019;');
  }

Any suggestions for improvement? It would obviously be easy to style these occurrences.
But how?
-- AlexSchroeder

== Click the heading to search for pages in this category / that link here ==

This bothers me similarly to the above since it just adds clutter for anyone who knows what clicking on a header does.  I would like to remove this too but this would probably not be well received.  I would suggest that this information is somehow shown on all pages but in an less intrusive way.

Maybe somewhere in the footer close to where the language links are too.  Then again this link ("Pages linking here") as well as the links to the translations can easily be missed.  Maybe both kinds should be placed somewhere more visible?  But if you do this please do so in a way that makes it easy to hide it using a style sheet.  -- JonasBernoulli

== Subscription service to  watch changes == 

There should be a way to subscribe to changes to pages of interest to users, including Emacs Lisp files.

[new]
The current option is to subscribe to RSS feeds for each page or for pages matching a particular regular expression. The html has appropriate meta links. Alternatively you could go to RecentChanges, figure out what settings you need and change "action=rc" in the URL to "action=rss".

The URL for this page, for example, would be one of these:

* ##http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=rss;rcidonly=EmacsWikiSuggestions## -- the default, listing the last major change in the last 7 days

* ##http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=rss;rcidonly=EmacsWikiSuggestions;days=30## -- listing the last major change in the last 30 days

* ##http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=rss;rcidonly=EmacsWikiSuggestions;showedit=1## -- listing the last change (major or minor) in the last 7 days

* ##http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=rss;rcidonly=EmacsWikiSuggestions;full=1## -- listing the last major change in the last 7 days with full page content (unless it's blows the arbitrary limit I've set in order to save bandwidth)

* ##http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=rss;rcidonly=EmacsWikiSuggestions;full=1;diff=1## -- listing the last major change in the last 7 days with full page content and diff

* ##http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/?action=rss;match=emacs## -- listing the last major change for any page matching the Perl regular expression "emacs" in the last 7 days

There are many more parameters to tune this.

Finally, if a few people were interested, we could add an _email subscription_ extension to the wiki. If you'd like to see this, edit this page and leave your name or send me an email <mailto:alex@emacswiki.org>.

-- AlexSchroeder

== Screenshots for major modes == 

I would like to see a screenshot showing what each mode looks like.

I just read about AllOut mode and wanted to see what it looked like; it would have been nice if there was a screenshot.

--LuisFernandes

== GoodFont for 1920x1080, 27" == 
The highest resolution at GoodFonts are 1600x1200, 19" (see [[GoodFonts#toc11|#TOC11]]). Now, a  good customer rated 27" cost $270 which gives you most inch per dollar ($27) in compared to larger screens. Also, the free graphic driver Nouveau are stable and works with many NVIDIA cards. 

Can you please add 1920x1080, 27" to GoodFonts
--David Englund

== GoodFont resolutions should be sorted DESC == 

Can you please sort the list descending at GoodFonts like this:

* For 1920x1080, 27"
* For 1600x1200, 19"
* For 1600x1200 or 1280x1024, 19"
* For 1600x1200, 15" (LCD)
* For 1280x1024, 17" (LCD)
* ...

Display resolution list in in software configurations usually begin with highest resolution anyways. For example in terminal see xrandr -q
