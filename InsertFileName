Code to insert a file name using Emacs's file name completion.

  (defun my-insert-file-name (arg filename)
    "Insert name of file FILENAME into buffer after point.
  Set mark after the inserted text.

  Prefixed with \\[universal-argument], expand the file name to
  its fully canocalized path.

  See `expand-file-name'."

    (interactive "*P\nfInsert file name: ")
    (if arg
	(insert (expand-file-name filename))
      (insert filename)))

Running

  M-x my-insert-file-name ~/.emacs RET

will insert the file name as it appears in the MiniBuffer.

If you want the full path to the file, you can have it "expanded" with a PrefixArgument.

Running

  C-u M-x my-insert-file-name ~/.emacs RET

will insert

  /home/username/.emacs

into the buffer.
