Code to insert a file name using Emacs's file name completion.

  (defun my-insert-file-name (filename &optional args)
    "Insert name of file FILENAME into buffer after point.

  Prefixed with \\[universal-argument], expand the file name to
  its fully canocalized path.  See `expand-file-name'.

  Prefixed with \\[negative-argument], use relative path to file
  name from current directory, `default-directory'.  See
  `file-relative-name'.

  The default with no prefix is to insert the file name exactly as
  it appears in the minibuffer prompt."
    ;; Based on insert-file in Emacs -- ashawley 20080926
    (interactive "*fInsert file name: \nP")
    (cond ((eq '- args)
           (insert (file-relative-name filename)))
          ((not (null args))
           (insert (expand-file-name filename)))
          (t
           (insert filename))))

Running

  M-x my-insert-file-name ~/.emacs RET

will insert the file name as it appears in the MiniBuffer.

If you want the full path to the file, you can have it "expanded" with a PrefixArgument.

Running

  C-u M-x my-insert-file-name ~/.emacs RET

will insert

  /home/username/.emacs

into the buffer.

Running

  M-- M-x my-insert-file-name ~/.emacs RET

will insert the relative path to the file, in this case just the file name.

  .emacs
