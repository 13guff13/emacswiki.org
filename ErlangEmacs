== Ermacs: An Emacs clone in Erlang ==

* http://www.bluetail.com/~luke/ermacs/

From the web site:

Tested on Linux and <nowiki>FreeBSD</nowiki>. Requires the S-Lang
terminal library and Erlang/ OTP R7B or later.  You can download
Ermacs 0.9 as a tarball and you can read <nowiki>ChangeLog</nowiki> to
find out what's new or to get a feel for how it's progressing.

The screenshot of the editor, which is all done in Erlang, should say
it all.
