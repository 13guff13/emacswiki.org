You can use OrgMode to blog.  There are a couple different ways to do this:

* OrgBlog -- create blog posts and publish them with OrgPublish

* [[Blorg]] -- publish finished tasks from an org file

* [http://renard.github.com/o-blog/ o-blog] -- Standalone blog publisher for org-mode (no other tool required).
