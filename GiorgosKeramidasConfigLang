Most of my text files are saved in ''UTF-8'' these days.  This makes things a lot easier when I have to email some text to people from other countries, or to include both Greek and English text in a single file.

The language environment setup I use for my Emacs sessions is enabled by a very short EmacsLisp module that is loaded at startup-time.  The module is called `##keramida-lang.el##' and I have installed it in my `##~/elisp##' personal folder.  Emacs can locate it and load it at startup-time by a small modification to the default `##load-path##':

    ;; Make sure Emacs can find loadable files in ~/elisp.
    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp")

Then my language setup is loaded from `##.emacs##' by:

    (require 'keramida-lang)                ;Language setup

The current contents of the `##keramida-lang.el##' module are:

    ;;; keramida-lang.el --- language setup for Emacs

    ;; Set the language environment based on the LANG and any LC_XXX
    ;; environment variables.
    (setq unibyte-display-via-language-environment t)

    ;; Prefer utf-8 as the encoding of files that do not explicitly specify
    ;; a coding-system for their contents.
    (prefer-coding-system 'utf-8)

    (provide 'keramida-lang)

    ;;; keramida-lang.el ends here
