==GNU-EMACS ON MS-WINDOWS OTHER THAN EMACSW32==

Apart from [[EmacsW32]] there are several distributions of binaries of Gnu-Emacs for
MS-Windows to choose from currently (Sept. 2007):

* So-called *CVS-versions* that are currently in development but are actually quite stable
  now. These are located on !SourceForge. There are currently two versions to choose from,
  22.1.50.1 and 23.0.0.1. Installation guidelines are below.

* *The official stable binaries.* These have version 22.1.1 which is a little out-dated
  (one notices e.g. that the tool-bar is black-and-white). But the resulting Emacs runs
  well with MS-Windows and Cygwin and guidelines for installation are given below.

* *Versions available through Cygwin setup.* These have drawbacks as detailed [[#below]],
  and installation guidelines will not be given here.

==GUIDELINES FOR INSTALLING EMACS ON MS-WINDOWS==

If installing the *CVS versions* from !SourceForge:

: Visit the site http://ntemacs.sourceforge.net and download one of the .exe files marked
  "binary" near the bottom (both are about 20 Mb). Once downloaded run the file (it is a
  self-extracting zip file) and answer "Extract to" with a directory (or folder) of your
  choice (e.g. ##c:\\packages##). A directory named ntemacs22 or ntemacs23 will be created
  therein.

Otherwise, to install the *official stable binaries*:

: Visit the site ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/ (or one of the mirrors listed at
  http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html; once at a mirror site select emacs and
  windows). Download the last zip-file listed (currently emacs-22.1-bin-i386.zip, 37
  Mb). You might also want to read the README file at the same site (not the one inside
  the zip-file). Once the zip-file is downloaded, open it using Explorer (slow) or 7zip
  (faster) and extract all the files into a directory of your choice
  (e.g. ##c:\packages\emacs-22.1.1##).

A subdirectory of the one just created will be /bin/
(e.g. ##c:\packages\ntemacs23\bin##). Enter this bin-directory and run ##addpm.exe##
(takes only a second). A shortcut to ##.../bin/runemacs.exe## will be created in the
/Start Menu/ (/Programs -- Gnu Emacs â€“ Emacs/). If you are using Vista you /must/ run
##addpm.exe## as an administrator, otherwise the registry entries will not be created.

[:below]Problems with *Cygwin distributed Emacs*. There are three versions of Gnu-Emacs
distributed with Cygwin, 21.2.12, 21.2.13 and 22.1.3. All of these have (some)
drawbacks. Without X-Windows they only run in the bash-command window where started, and
at least in some settings the Window painting is garbled. To enable Emacs running in its
own window one must install X-Windows, and in addition open an /xterm/-window and start
Emacs from there. The xterm-window does not honour national keyboards (at least without
some twitching).

==SETTING UP EMACS ON MS-WINDOWS==

This section describes two of the more important steps for setting up Emacs on
MS-Windows: The /home directory/ and the /starting directory/. In addition, MS-Windows
users may want to change the initial /size/ and /position/ of the Emacs window, the /font/
and /colours/ used, the /indentation behaviour/ when editing programs, the behaviour of
/regions/ selected with the mouse, and last but not least they may want to redefine
keyboard shortcuts to be more like what is traditional in MS-Windows. Customization of
these features is described in MsWindowsCustomize.

When run by selecting the shortcut, by default Emacs starts in the bin subdirectory of the
installation folder and when started from a command line it starts in the current
directory. In both cases the /home/ directory (where customization files are read from, in
particular the ##.emacs## file) is set to ##C:\Documents and Settings\##/user/##\Application
Data## (on Vista it is set to ##C:\Users\##/user/##\AppData\Roaming##). It is possible to stick
with this default behaviour and place customization files in Application Data, but here
it is assumed that the default is changed. To take an
example assume that Cygwin has been set up and the user's home directory for Cygwin is
##c:\cygwin\home\smith## (or cygwinized: ##/home/smith##). It might be natural to make
this the home directory for Emacs and make it start there (in the following replace
##smith## with your username.

*Changing the directory where Emacs starts:* Right-click on the icon (shortcut) used to
start Emacs, select /Properties/, and type ##c:\cygwin\home\smith## into 
/Shorcut -- Start in/.

[:HomeDirectory]*Setting the home directory:* Select
/My Computer -- Advanced -- Environment variables -- System variables -- New/
and enter ##HOME## as the variable name and
##c:\cygwin\home\smith## as its value. See also MsWindowsDotEmacs.

*Setting the home directory on Vista:* Open the /Control Panel/. If you are using /Classic View/
open /User Accounts/ and then select /Change my environment varaibles/ from the Task Pane. If
you are using the default view of /Control Panel/, you have to select /User Accounts and Family Safety/
before you can select /User Accounts/. Either way, set up the ##HOME## environment variable as
described above.  See also MsWindowsDotEmacs.
