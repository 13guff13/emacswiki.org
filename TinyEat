tinyeat.el is part of the TinyTools.

== Overview ==

The default emacs keybindings aren't the most convenient for quick deletion without saving to the kill ring.
The tinyeat offers a lot of useful delete functionality. E.g. helpers for two kinds of deletion

* delete without saving
* saving to the kill ring

and operations on words:

* eat parts of words (i.e. QuickDele?teBrown -> QuickBrown) which is great for misspelled vars when programming
* eat whole word
* lines
* paragraphs
* etc.

== Customization ==

[new] 
I tweaked it a bit, here are some of my helpers:
{{{
(global-set-key [(delete)]		
    (lambda () 
     (interactive) 
       (re-search-forward "\\s-*" nil t) 
       (tinyeat-delete-whole-word))) ;; only because I'm too lazy to move forward to the next word to delete.

(global-set-key [(shift backspace)]		
    (lambda () 
     (interactive) 
      (re-search-backward "\\s-*" nil t) 
      (backward-char 1) 
      (tinyeat-delete-whole-word))) ;; another lazy thing

;; I want to paste something I just saved to the kill ring without having the current region get saved.
(global-set-key "M-del" 'delete-region) 
}}}

Just my bindings. The tiny tools are great tho, I highly recommend them
