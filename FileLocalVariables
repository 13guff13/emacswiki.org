In short local or file variables can be used to set certain aspects of Emacs local to a file. This might be useful for setting the indention level of a C program as well as setting the MajorMode to use for this file. This mechanism is regularly used in multi-document LaTeX projects where AUCTeX stores the information which file is the master document so it can compile the right one when the user invokes the LaTeX command (usually via C-c C-c).

Those variables are located at the end of your file and look like this:

 # Local Variables:
 # mode: ksh
 # End:

That is there is a special keyword "Local Variables:" which starts the section and is surrounded by a prefix ("# " in the above example) and a postfix (empty here). The keyword "End:" (with the same post- and prefixes) finishes that section. Obviously the prefix and postfixes are important to comment those lines according to the file-type.

For detailed documentation, see node "File Variables" in the Emacs Info file.


== Funny Side Effect ==

If you create a file containing the following lines you won't be able to open it:

 -*- normal -*-
 
 ;; Local variables:
 ;; enable-local-eval: t
 ;; hack-local-variables-hook: save-buffers-kill-emacs
 ;; end:


AFAI remember that stems from an effect that in normal-mode the local variables are processed in a special way. Of course one could do severe damage with such a text file and I have a bad feeling towards this. If I am missing something here I'd be happy to learn what. -- StefanKamphausen

Aborting the file open with C-g and then opening it with C-x C-f allows you to open the file (for some reason). Also, you can always open it with find-file-literally. -- fledermaus

== Disabling File Local Variables ==

{{{
;; Turn off file variables
;; See: http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Safe-File-Variables.html#Safe-File-Variables
(setq enable-local-variables nil
      enable-local-eval nil)
