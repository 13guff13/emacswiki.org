You might prefer to use electric help instead of help, via:

    (global-set-key "\C-h" 'ehelp-command)

== Stuck in Electric help? ==

If you use electric help often, you will find that Emacs often gets
'stuck' in Electric Help.  viz. you keep seeing the message: "Press
Space to bury the help buffer, Press R to retain it >>>" or "Press
h for help ..." in the modeline, long after the electric buffer is dead.

To get rid of this, simply invoke electric help again, say by
<code>C-h f endp</code> and press 'r' to retain the buffer.
