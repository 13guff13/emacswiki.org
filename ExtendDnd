== Possible Dependencies ==

`assoc', `backquote', `button', `bytecomp', `cconv', `cl',
`dropdown-list', `easymenu', `help-fns', `help-mode',
`macroexp', `view', `warnings', `yasnippet', `yasnippet-bundle'.

== Introduction ==
I would like to drag files onto a ESS buffer and write the appropriate
code.  Enter Extend drag and drop.
== Installation ==
To install, put the <tt>extend-dnd.el</tt> somewhere in your load path, and add
the following lines to your startup file, usually <tt>~/.emacs</tt>

{{{
(require 'extend-dnd)
(extend-dnd-activate)
}}}
== Status and Future ==
Currently it only supports a few modes and extensions, but it is extendable.
== Working with Yasnippets ==
If you want extend-dnd to expand yasnippets based on the file name,
make sure that <tt>yas/wrap-around-region</tt> is set to be <tt>'t</tt> or <tt>'cua</tt>.

After you define a snippet in the major mode you are working with, and put
the file name as `yas/selected-text'.  For example with R csv files
you could define

<pre>
# -*- mode: snippet -*-
# name: Load CSV
# key: csv
# --
${1:$(concat "dat." (replace-regexp-in-string "^[.]" "" (replace-regexp-in-string "[.]$" "" (replace-regexp-in-string "[^A-Za-z.0-9]+" "." (file-name-sans-extension (file-name-nondirectory yas/text)) t t))))} <- read.csv("${1:`yas/selected-text`}");

</pre>

Then once this has been defined press <tt>C-cC-d</tt> to add the extension to
the drag and drop list. 

The extension will be expanded based on the <tt>key</tt> value.  Therefore,
if you want more than one possible action for a particular file, give
it the same key.

For example, if you want the possibility to write to the csv you
dragged in, you may wish to have the snippet:

<pre>
# -*- mode: snippet -*-
# name: Write csv
# key: csv
# --
write.csv(d,"${1:`yas/selected-text`}");

</pre>

== Wish List/TODO ==
=== TODO Support dired mode ===
=== TODO Support inferior processes. ===
=== TODO Allow generic Yasnippet expansion by key name (like dnd_csv will automatically do drag and drop for csv files) ===
