On IRC, user *quazimodo* suggested that we should indicate "outdated" pages:

13:02 <quazimodo> oh my god the emacs wiki is a piece of shit
13:09 <quazimodo> yeah it has no in build maintenance
13:09 <quazimodo> anything over a year old ought to be flagged
      as potentially out dated

I installed [[Oddmuse:Age Indication Extension|an extension]] that adds a class to the body element based on its age. Right now pages that have not been edited for more than a year, get a "linen" background color. -> OutOfDate

I'm not sure I like it. What do you think?

# great
# meh
# keep the note and loose the background color change
# other?

Known *problems*: 

# old pages that include new content such as RecentChanges and [[News]] are also marked as "old"
# the note is added by the CSS and does not depend on your language settings

To be clear I threw out an arbitrary period. Perhaps there is a general consensus on what may be considered as potentially outdated. If so, then a user ought to know about this - and it should be very easy to see. I've followed a fair bit of very out dated and now irrelevant advice because of this lack of obvious, clear info or guidance.

So yeah, we should do *something* to increase the affective ease of understanding what's relevant or not
