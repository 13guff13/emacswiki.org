On IRC, user *quazimodo* suggested that we should indicate "outdated" pages:

13:02 <quazimodo> oh my god the emacs wiki is a piece of shit
13:09 <quazimodo> yeah it has no in build maintenance
13:09 <quazimodo> anything over a year old ought to be flagged
      as potentially out dated

I installed [[Oddmuse:Age Indication Extension|an extension]] that adds a class to the body element based on its age. Right now pages that have not been edited for more than a year, get a "linen" background color. -> OutOfDate

I'm not sure I like it. What do you think?

# great
# meh
# keep the note and loose the background color change
# other?

Known *problems*: 

# old pages that include new content such as RecentChanges and [[News]] are also marked as "old"
# the note is added by the CSS and does not depend on your language settings

To be clear I threw out an arbitrary period. Perhaps there is a general consensus on what may be considered as potentially outdated. If so, then a user ought to know about this - and it should be very easy to see. I've followed a fair bit of very out dated and now irrelevant advice because of this lack of obvious, clear info or guidance.

So yeah, we should do *something* to increase the affective ease of understanding what's relevant or not

I think this is a terrible idea.  It makes no sense whatsoever.  A page or an edit on a page can be 5 minutes old and be out-of-date or just plain wrong, with bad information.  A page can be 10 years old with up-to-date, solid information.

There are many different kinds of info on the wiki.  Some info will not require any changes, pretty much forever.  Some info might have been updated recently but is lousy information.

The way to "''do *something* to increase the affective ease of understanding what's relevant or not''" is for wiki '''''users''''' to comment on it (or just update it).  Trying to determine by algorithm is completely misguided, IMHO.  Relying on wiki ''users'' for wiki quality is the right approach.

If you find ''particular'' pages with ''particular'' info that is out of date, then flag it --- either on the page itself or via a ##Comments## page about it.  Better yet, just update the info, if you can.

Imagine applying your suggestion to the Web: automatically flagging all web pages/sites that have not been updated within, say, 2 years as possibly out-of-date.  Think about it.  There is a reason that we don't do this kind of thing.  Makes no sense.

Just one opinion -- DrewAdams

I agree with Drew. It might be useful to flag advice that is only valid for older Emacsen, though. Maybe having a tag like [legacy "Emacs <= 22.2"] that adds a little flag might be useful. Not sure if it's worth the effort, though. Just adding a comment pointing out this might be enough. --shjk
