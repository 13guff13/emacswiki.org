I have used ange-ftp with windows ftp client successfully on Windows XP for several years. Now I moved to Windows Seven and it stopped work properly (with exactly the same emacs version). It took me quite a while to understand that, on Seven, the hash command does not include a newline in the end. Then you get things like

####226 Transfer complete.

instead of 

####

226 Transfer complete.

simple solution... 

(setq  ange-ftp-send-hash nil)
