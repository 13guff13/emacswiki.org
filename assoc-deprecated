Find the culprit libraries causing the following error message on emacs 24 startup

    error: Package assoc is obsolete!
    
 
The following code was used to search my el-git directory for files containg (require 'assoc)

     find ~/.emacs.d/el-git -name "*.el" -exec grep -H "(require 'assoc)" {} \;
    ./yasnippet/yasnippet.el:(require 'assoc)
    ./org-mode/contrib/lisp/org-export-generic.el:(require 'assoc)
    ./magit/magit-key-mode.el:(require 'assoc)

I deleted the line from yasnippet and it still works. 

assoc is now implemented in source code
