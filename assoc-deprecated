Find the culprit libraries causing the following error message on emacs 24 startup

    error: Package assoc is obsolete!
    
 
The following code was used to search my el-git directory for files containg (require 'assoc)

     find ~/.emacs.d/el-git -name "*.el" -exec grep -H "(require 'assoc)" {} \;
    ./yasnippet/yasnippet.el:(require 'assoc)
    ./org-mode/contrib/lisp/org-export-generic.el:(require 'assoc)
    ./magit/magit-key-mode.el:(require 'assoc)

I deleted the require statements from these files.

This solves the error message. Every thing seems to run ok

assoc is now implemented in c code

Please don't do that, or at least don't advise others to do that :)

The comments above are very misleading:
* by blindly removing requirements, you **will** break code
* `assoc' has always been implemented in C. assoc.el was about some other helpers (such as `aput', `adelete', ...) that were deemed unworthy. So, removing the dependency to assoc.el will only help for code that actually **didn't** use any of those
* assoc.el will only be obsolete in upcoming Emacs 24.2
* please instead contact the packages maintainers to have these fixed. For Magit, I fixed it recently in the git repository, and this will be part of the upcoming 1.1.2 version

I suggest this page be rewritten entirely, or just deleted
