See WikiOrganization for some info on how the pages are organised amongst each other.

# Find the appropriate category on the SiteMap.
# Edit the category page and add a link to the new page.  See NamingNewPages for more.
# Follow the newly created link to the edit page.
# Enter the text, add a link back to the category page, and save.

You can also create a new page by ''URL munging''.
Just edit the current URL to point to a new page which doesn't exist.
The new URL might look like this, for example:

* http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki?SampleUndefinedPage
