Shell-Pop is a utility which helps you pop up and pop out shell buffer window easily.

== Download ==
----
You can download shell-pop.el from the following link.

Lisp:shell-pop.el


== How to use ==
----
1. Place this file in a directory in your load-path.

2. Load the shell-pop elisp using "require" (See below configuration in detail)

3. M-x shell-pop. The shell buffer window appears at the bottom of the selected window.

4. You can enjoy shell.

5. M-x shell-pop. The shell buffer window destroyed if you call shell-pop again. The buffer is not buried. 

== Configuration for your .emacs ==
----
You can choose your favorite internal mode from `shell', `terminal', `ansi-term', and 'eshell'.
Also you can use any shell such as `/bin/bash', `/bin/tcsh', `/bin/zsh' as you like.

You are recommend to assign one hot key to shell-pop for its toggled action. :-)

<pre>
(require 'shell-pop)
(shell-pop-set-internal-mode "ansi-term")
(shell-pop-set-internal-mode-shell "/bin/zsh")
(shell-pop-set-window-height 60) ; the number for the percentage of the selected window. 
(global-set-key [f8] 'shell-pop)
</pre>

I have made some modifications to make it easier to have shell-pop run a different function (because I wanted to run ansi-term instead of shell...)

What's the best way to get those changes back to you to look at?

Thank you for your requirement and it was already done. Now you can use ansi-term and your favorite shell with shell-pop!
