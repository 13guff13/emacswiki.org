Hello, this is my little corner of the Emacs Wiki web.
Aka. [::johnw] on the EmacsChannel.

I've been an Emacs user since 1994, but only learned to program in Elisp starting around 1997.

You can find my webpage-of-Emacs-fun at:

People looking for TimeClock, please note that it is now part of Emacs.

For people looking for TimeClock, but are using XEmacs 21.4 -- it is not included with it.  From where should us folks get it?

John, have you removed all your elisp stuff from your site?

From JohnWiegley: I am in the midst of recreating my site using the latest version of Muse.  When it's done, the new Emacs page will be here:

I have a question about <code>align.el</code> bundled with emacs 22.

The command <code>C-u M-x align</code> in text mode fails to align
strings of length one:

   1 1 1                            1   1    1    
   11 11 11            gives        11  11     11 
   111 111 111                      111 111    111

Why not using the regular expression:
 
              "\\(^\\|\\S-\\)\\([ \t]+\\)"  

  instead of  "\\(^\\|\\S-\\)\\([ \t]+\\)\\(\\S-\\|$\\)"

in the <code>text-column</code> part of the <code>align-rules-list</code>
variable ? This seems to solve the problem.

Do you have a new version of scanner.el package (Create elisp scanners using Flex)?

The link http://oneworld.new-era.com/johnw/emacs.html is broken.
