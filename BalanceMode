Balance-mode is what I use to keep track of my checking account.  It is a modified version of the balance-mode.el by Bob Newell and Jason Baietto.  It is available at
http://vh213601.truman.edu/~belanger/Elisp/balance.el
I use a simplified version, http://vh213601.truman.edu/~belanger/Elisp/creditcard.el
to keep track of my credit cards.
