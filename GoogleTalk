How Setup Google Talk in Emacs

== jabber.el 0.7.1 and below ==
Setting up emacs to use Google Talk is pretty easy since it uses the
XMPP protocol, which is handled by jabber clients.  [[JabberEl]] works
well (at least from the arch sources available), and setup the
following variables, either through customization or in your .emacs
file:

  (setq jabber-username "username")
  (setq jabber-password "password")
  (setq jabber-nickname "nick")
  (setq jabber-connection-type (quote ssl))
  (setq jabber-network-server "talk.google.com")
  (setq jabber-server "gmail.com")

Under gentoo, I had to install the gnutls package to get everything
working just fine, your mileage may vary.  After that, you might
find this function handy:

  (defun jabber ()
    (interactive)
    (jabber-connect)
    (switch-to-buffer "*-jabber-*"))

Allowing you to M-x jabber to load up the client.

The jabber.el client is pretty self explanitory, but consult its page
for further help and tips.

== jabber.el 0.7.90 and later ==

If you use both Emacs and Gnus from CVS, you can probably get away
with just hitting C-x C-j C-c and entering your Gmail address, but
most of us mortals will need a setup like the following:

  (setq jabber-account-list
    '(("username@gmail.com" 
       (:network-server . "talk.google.com")
       (:connection-type . ssl))))

And make sure that you have either gnutls-cli or openssl installed
and in your path.  Then C-x C-j C-c should Just Workâ„¢.

== groupchat ==

Here is a function to create use google groupchat:

  (defun egh:jabber-google-groupchat-create ()
      (interactive)
      (let ((group (apply 'format "private-chat-%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x-%x%x%x%x-%x%x%x%x-%x%x%x%x-%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x@groupchat.google.com"
                          (mapcar (lambda (x) (random x)) (make-list 32 15))))
            (account (jabber-read-account)))
        (jabber-groupchat-join account group (jabber-muc-read-my-nickname account group) t)))
