also known as [::legumbre] on #emacs
 
I use emacs. A lot. I use it for mail (gnus), IM (ERC+bitlbee), gtd (OrgMode) and pretty much everything else.
I use it to write C, Objective-C, java, elisp and ocasionally some vhdl.

In case you're wondering, these are some things I can't live without

* iswitchb and its virtual buffers
* dabbrev-expand and its more promiscuous cousin hippie-expand
* EmacsTags for source code navigation
* ff-find-other-file
* dired and wdired
* re-builder for testing your regexes interactively
* [[uniquify]] with reverse style and pipe separator
* savehist-mode

Long ago I added the following lines to my .emacs:

   (global-unset-key [right])
   (global-unset-key [left])
   (global-unset-key [down])
   (global-unset-key [up])

Unbinding the arrows forced me to adopt C-n, C-p, M-n, M-p and to become better acquainted with 
sexps navigation functions. Not only did this increase my productivity when using emacs, but also in the command line.

I encourage you to try it out, it can be a bit frustrating at first, but it's definitely worth it.
