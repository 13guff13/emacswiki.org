This page is one of the worst/best examples of  "I'm new to emacs and I've decided it isn't good enough so I think you should all change it by rewriting everything - I'll help by shouting abuse at you from the sidelines and foaming at the mouth"-itis that there is on this wiki (and there is quite a lot of it).

I don't know why we are so self abusive or put up with people being abusive about us. I guess it's because we are such a broad church.

Anyway, a lot of this is crap now. You get lexical scope, you get concurrency (if you want it) etc...
