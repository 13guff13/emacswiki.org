I just realized, that JohnMcCarthy is still alive (may God keep his health), which made me wonder, isn't this guy, some kind of a legend, he invented Lisp. How come he doesn't get more attention, from the informatics press?

And he seems not alone in this, same apply to EdsgerDijkstra and DonaldKnuth, maybe Knuth gets some attention, but not much. (''Note that Dijkstra doesn't live anymore.'')

Why doesn't companies like IBM, or free organizations like GNU, try to sponsor/hire, a Knuth/Dijkstra/McCarthy effort to create an OS or a programming language? I am sure they can make a design and provide an implementation that can be as legendary as the persons these people are.
