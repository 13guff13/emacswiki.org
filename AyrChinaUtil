Lisp:ayr-china-util.el

Convert chinese characters to pinyin, using TONEPY and PY-b5
(or rather, excerpts of those.)  It does this by building a
hash table of b5 and gb chars, mapped to pinyin.  For chars
with multitple readings, it maps them to "pinyin0|pinyin1|...",
etc.  For instance, one character maps to "xing2|heng2|hang4|hang2".

This library needs work, the least to give it better names,
a better name overall, documentation, and better library-fu
(for instance, it should probably PROVIDE a feature). (ooh,
and if C-u C-x =  could use this to also show the pinyin
readings...)


! bah, the encoding didn't survive.  I'll get back to this.

Yeah, anything that's a page on the wiki is UTF-8 encoded.
You need to put octal escapes in your lisp code, or use a file upload.
