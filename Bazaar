Bazaar (aka <code>bzr</code>) is a distributed version control system much like [[Git]], [[Mercurial]]
and DaRcs.

Bazaar is available from http://bazaar-vcs.org.

== Modes ==

* [[VC]] -- supports Bazaar through the vc-bzr.el backend. Is distributed with Emacs since version 22.2. You can also get it [http://www.loveshack.ukfsn.org/emacs/vc-bzr.el here].
* [[DVC]] -- supports Bazaar.
* Lisp:bazaar.el -- A user interface specific to Bazaar.

== Emacs from Bazaar ==

Let say I have a repo "foo".

foo contains my stable developement tree and contains also a directory
with experimental stuff. I want to get rid of the experimental stuff
and put it in another branch. How would you do that with [[Bazaar]] ?

In the end, I think I should have this layout:

foo/trunk => main repo
foo/experimental => a branch containing only experimental stuff
