I use Emacs for nearly everything in daily job: 
* reading mail/news with Gnus (CategoryGnus), 
* chatting with [[Lispy]]
* controlling my window manager through SawFishMode, 
* or even editing text files.

The modes I frequently use are AUCTeX and CcMode.

Sometimes I idle in the EmacsChannel under the nickname [::Sigma]. 

Since I work on several different computers I need to keep my configuration online and up-to-date : this is the "dotemacs" project on Mtpforge. You can download it via

 svn checkout https://mtpforge.melting-pot.org/svn/dotemacs/trunk dotemacs

My home page also hosts a big part of my configuration (http://www.lifl.fr/~hodique/Perso/Emacs), but it's updated... when I have enough time and motivation :-)
If someone is interested, one can also find some hacks for sawfish in these pages (http://www.lifl.fr/~hodique/Perso/Sawfish)

A good part of the elisp code I use is not very clean, and I try to make it better when I have time. I like advices, macros, and wish I had a better knowledge of these interesting mechanisms (and hope I will ;))

I adapted ErBot so that it can be used with http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/octopus (an extensible chat server I wrote) through Lispy. This way I can annoy the Mtp people with emacs.

I occasionally contribute to PlannerMusePort.

more to come :-)
