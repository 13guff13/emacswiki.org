I use Emacs for nearly everything in daily job: 
* reading mail/news with Gnus (CategoryGnus), 
* organizing myself with OrgMode
* or even editing text files.

The modes I frequently use are AUCTeX and CcMode.

Sometimes I idle in the EmacsChannel under the nickname [::Sigma]. 

Since I work on several different computers I need to keep my configuration online and up-to-date : this is part of my [https://github.com/sigma/dotfiles dotfiles] project on GitHub. You can download it via

 git checkout git://github.com/sigma/dotfiles.git

A good part of the elisp code I use is not very clean, and I try to make it better when I have time. I like advices, macros, and wish I had a better knowledge of these interesting mechanisms (and hope I will ;))

I adapted ErBot so that it can be used with http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/octopus (an extensible chat server I wrote) through Lispy. This way I can annoy the Mtp people with emacs.

I occasionally contribute to PlannerMusePort.

more to come :-)
