I have been using Gnu Emacs for about three years now, and can't get enough!

I am currently working on the Google Summer of Code for Drupal [http://groups.drupal.org/node/22301 here], using Emacs for all my editing needs.

I work primarily in Ruby, Java, PHP, JavaScript, and Bash, plus a little bit of C and C++ (when I can't avoid it :).

= My Emacs files =

* TabCompletion - I recently created a [http://github.com/chrono325/smart-tab/tree/master repository] for Smart Tab.
