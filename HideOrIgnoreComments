This page is about library '''<tt>[[hide-comnt.el]]</tt>''' and related features.

== Library `hide-comnt.el' ==

##hide-comnt.el## provides two commands, a macro, and a user option:

* [[command]] '''`hide/show-comments'''' -- Does what its name says.  If the [[region]] is [[active region|active]] then hiding is limited to the region.  With a [[prefix argument]], hidden comments are shown again.

* command '''`hide/show-comments-toggle'''' -- Toggles hiding/showing in the active region, or the whole buffer if the region is inactive.

* EmacsLisp [[macro]] '''`with-comments-hidden'''' --  Temporarily hides comments while it executes a body of code.  You do not see the commented text disappear and reappear -- it is effectively just ignored while processing the body.  The macro uses `hide/show-comments' to hide the comments.

* [[user option]] '''`ignore-comments-flag'''' -- If `nil', then `with-comments-hidden' does not ignore comments.


== Features that Use `hide-comnt.el' ==

* Commands '''`next-visible-thing'''' and '''`previous-visible-thing'''', in library <tt>[[thing-cmds.el]]</tt>, use macro `with-comments-hidden', so they ignore things that are in commented code.

* In '''[[Icicles]]''':

** '''`##C-M-;##'''' in the [[minibuffer]] toggles option `ignore-comments-flag'.

** Command '''`icicle-search-thing'''' respects the option: when non-`nil' it ignores (does not search) ThingAtPoint things that are commented out.

** Commands '''`icicle-next-visible-thing'''' and '''`icicle-previous-visible-thing'''' are similar to `next-visible-thing' and `previous-visible-thing' from <tt>[[thing-cmds.el]]</tt>.

== Comments ==

* Added an ELPA package of this library for download here: http://www.wisdomandwonder.com/link/6390/hide-or-ignore-comments-elpa-package

* Noticed that it does not quite work for Ruby files, attaching a screenshot that illustrates the problem. Any idea?
