Just follow instructions and it goes as smoothly as it gets.

A gotcha for newbies like me: 

  Often the 'make' on sun is the Sun make, not the GNU make. 
  Please make sure that GNU make is what gets called.

 Also, nice to have gcc installed rather than sun's cc...

Also, if you are receiving errors such as:

Fatal error (11).make[1]: *** [blessmail] Segmentation Fault (core dumped)

Try building with cc, by using --without-gcc

Building GNU emacs 21.3 with GCC 3.3: There is a known bug in emacs 21.3 where it assumes that zero-initialized data is in the .data segment (GCC 3.3 optimizes zero-initalized data into the .bss segment). emacs will compile and the temacs executable will run but emacs itself will segfault in __do_global_dtors_aux (). The workaround is to patch emacs yourself (see the bugreport link below for more information and patches) or grab the emacs source from CVS.
