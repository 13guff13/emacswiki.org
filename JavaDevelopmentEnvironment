== Current status ==

[new]
Since the release of Emacs 22 there has not been any official release of JDEE that works from scratch.
Paul Kinnucan, the heroe maintainer of JDEE, has not had as much time with JDEE as he would have needed.
However it now looks as JDEE will start to move forward again.
If you are interested please see the JDEE mailing list, especially 2007 December in the
[http://news.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.jdee JDEE mailing list archive].

[new]
August 2009: latest version 2.3.5.1 is very old and has lots of known bugs. Use the 2.4.0 from branch inside the Subversion repository at: [https://jdee.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jdee https://jdee.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jdee]. It works fine with Emacs 22.2.1, CEDET-1.0pre6, and ECB-2.40. To build 2.4.0 you need to install [http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net ant-contrib] and set cedet and elib paths in ~/.jdee-config.properties if are different that default.

[new]
Install notes for Gnu Emacs 23. This will help you get (require 'jde) running. No guarantee on anything else.

I see there are some discussions on their mailing list, but don't see changes to the [http://jdee.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/jdee/branches/2.4.0/jde/lisp/ChangeLog?view=log ChangeLog]. Is this project still active? I really dislike eclipse.

jde depends: cedet, elib. 
<pre>
(add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/cedet-common/")
(add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/cedet-contrib/")
;;for jde
(require 'cedet)

(add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/elib/")
</pre>

Then you need to edit jdel.el in lisp dir.

Remove or comment out the following lines, because autoload is now part of emacs, and there is no jde-autoloads.el in jde src.
<pre>
(require 'jde-autoload)
....
(unless 
    (and jde-xemacsp
	 (file-exists-p 
	  (expand-file-name 
	   "jde/auto-autoloads.el"
	   (jde-root))))
	 (require 'jde-autoload))
</pre>

For jde itself, add these to .emacs, change the dirs to fit your install of course:
<pre>
;;--------------------
;; jde

(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/jde-current/")
(require 'jde)
(setq jde-web-browser "firefox")
(setq jde-doc-dir "~/d/jdk-6-doc/")
</pre>

I don't know much about it myself. Since this project is last active in Dec 2007. I guess there are more problems waiting.

'''How to load JDE in Emacs >=23.2 (after CEDET integration into Emacs trunk)''':
I fear it is complex, as the CEDET inclusion changed package names but JDEE is still using the old ones (tested in branches 2.4 and trunk). For instance (require 'semantic-ctxt) is the old name (standalone CEDET), but in the Emacs-included CEDET it should be transformed to (require 'semantic/ctxt). Someone must update JDEE. 24.m3.2010, [[DanielClemente]]

== Distributions ==

* Debian Etch - installed and loaded correctly
* Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy Gibbon) - requires a patch [[JDE Ubuntu Patch]]

'''''Note from 2004:''''' If you use the Debian Sid <tt>jde</tt> package with CVS Emacs, you may need to apply this [http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-pretest-bug/2004-11/msg00145.html patch].

== JDEE compared with other IDEs ==

* JdeeVsEclipse. Still to write

== Frequently Given Answers (FGA) ==

Did you install it correctly as documented?
The website says: "Nearly all the JDEE problems that I have seen are caused by faulty setups," and "Most problems reported by users are installation/setup problems."  See the [http://jdee.sunsite.dk/trouble-shooting.htm Trouble Shooting Guide] (Dead link).

== Alternatives ==
[http://github.com/espenhw/malabar-mode malabar-mode] is an effort to create a better Java mode for Emacs.

== Comments ==

[new]
I'm happy to see that somebody is investigating the current status of JDE!
Thanks, DanielClemente. -- AlexSchroeder

*Stupid Question Time* Really, I am not as helpless as this message is going to make me sound. I just upgraded to 23.1.50.1 (Ubuntu 9.4 incase that makes any difference) and have been beating my head against getting JDEE to install. I have CEDET 1.0pre7 (from cvs), elib 1.0 (built on the local system with 23), and I even got ecb to work (2.41 (or 2.40...the internal version numbers are not consistent with the messages) from cvs) by commenting out the jde. 

I got the svn of jdee and put version 2.40 in the load path and went to town. Sort of.

So, what is the problem? When processing efc.el (eieio foundation classes), the byte-compiling of the definition of efc-coll-add craps out. The error is all about wrong number of arguments and includes three lines of character codes. By looking at the backtrace it appears that the problem is in processing the string passed to error. That is, 
<pre>
(error "Tried to add an item of type %s to a list of items of type %s" (typep item) (oref this elem-type))
</pre>
is being processed. When the (typep item) is passed to byte-optimize-form (and on down to byte-optimize-form-walker and compiler-macroexpand) things go badly awry. I have not hacked elisp for many a moon so I am lost, lost, lost. Any hints would be greatly appreciated. It took me most of a day to get this much information and I don't have a lot of time to go deeper, though I really want jdee to work with 23.
