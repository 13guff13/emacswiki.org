The Java Development Environment for Emacs ([::JDEE]) is an integrated development environment for Emacs. It interfaces Emacs to command-line Java development tools, for instance Sun's JDK.

The current state of the project is gaining momentum after a few years of atrophy.  Once development is back on track, documentation here and on the project web site will be updated.

* The last version prior to the move to sourceforge (2.3.5.1) is very old and has lots of known bugs.
* The most recent release since the move (2.4.0.1) is a large improvement, but is still very old. It works fine with Emacs 22.2.1, CEDET-1.0pre6, and ECB-2.40.
* If you want to use JDEE with emacs versions >=23, you are best to build from the SVN trunk. Patches are gladly accepted to help move things along.

Install notes for Gnu Emacs 23. This will help you get (require 'jde) running. No guarantee on anything else.

jde depends: cedet, elib. 
<pre>
(add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/cedet-common/")
(add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/cedet-contrib/")
;;for jde
(require 'cedet)

(add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/elib/")
</pre>

Then you need to edit jdel.el in lisp dir.

Remove or comment out the following lines, because autoload is now part of emacs, and there is no jde-autoloads.el in jde src.
<pre>
(require 'jde-autoload)
....
(unless 
    (and jde-xemacsp
	 (file-exists-p 
	  (expand-file-name 
	   "jde/auto-autoloads.el"
	   (jde-root))))
	 (require 'jde-autoload))
</pre>

For jde itself, add these to .emacs, change the dirs to fit your install of course:
<pre>
;;--------------------
;; jde

(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/jde-current/")
(require 'jde)
(setq jde-web-browser "firefox")
(setq jde-doc-dir "~/d/jdk-6-doc/")
</pre>

I don't know much about it myself. I guess there are more problems waiting.

'''How to load JDE in Emacs >=23.2 (after CEDET integration into Emacs trunk)''':
I fear it is complex, as the CEDET inclusion changed package names but JDEE is still using the old ones (tested in branches 2.4 and trunk). For instance (require 'semantic-ctxt) is the old name (standalone CEDET), but in the Emacs-included CEDET it should be transformed to (require 'semantic/ctxt). Someone must update JDEE. 24.m3.2010, [[DanielClemente]]

I finally got JDE to work (mostly) with emacs 23.2.  Here is what I did:

1) Download trunk source from svn.
2) Extract the source
3) ant configure
4) ant

here is my init file...  There a few 'tricks' in here:

<pre>

;; Update the Emacs load-path to include the path to
;; the JDE and its require packages. This code assumes

== Distributions ==

* Debian Etch - installed and loaded correctly
* Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy Gibbon) - requires a patch [[JDE Ubuntu Patch]]

'''''Note from 2004:''''' If you use the Debian Sid <tt>jde</tt> package with CVS Emacs, you may need to apply this [http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-pretest-bug/2004-11/msg00145.html patch].

== JDEE compared with other IDEs ==

* JdeeVsEclipse. Still to write

== Frequently Given Answers (FGA) ==

Did you install it correctly as documented?
The website says: "Nearly all the JDEE problems that I have seen are caused by faulty setups," and "Most problems reported by users are installation/setup problems."  See the [http://jdee.sunsite.dk/trouble-shooting.htm Trouble Shooting Guide] (Dead link).

== Alternatives ==
[http://github.com/espenhw/malabar-mode malabar-mode] is an effort to create a better Java mode for Emacs.

== Comments ==

[new]
I'm happy to see that somebody is investigating the current status of JDE!
Thanks, DanielClemente. -- AlexSchroeder

JDEE development continues (slowly) on the trunk of the sourceforge repository (http://jdee.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/jdee/trunk/jdee/), you are more likely to find something that works with current emacs there. Please submit patches to the sourceforge jdee mailing list to help move things forward. -- LenTrigg

*Stupid Question Time* Really, I am not as helpless as this message is going to make me sound. I just upgraded to 23.1.50.1 (Ubuntu 9.4 incase that makes any difference) and have been beating my head against getting JDEE to install. I have CEDET 1.0pre7 (from cvs), elib 1.0 (built on the local system with 23), and I even got ecb to work (2.41 (or 2.40...the internal version numbers are not consistent with the messages) from cvs) by commenting out the jde. 

I got the svn of jdee and put version 2.40 in the load path and went to town. Sort of.

So, what is the problem? When processing efc.el (eieio foundation classes), the byte-compiling of the definition of efc-coll-add craps out. The error is all about wrong number of arguments and includes three lines of character codes. By looking at the backtrace it appears that the problem is in processing the string passed to error. That is, 
<pre>
(error "Tried to add an item of type %s to a list of items of type %s" (typep item) (oref this elem-type))
</pre>
is being processed. When the (typep item) is passed to byte-optimize-form (and on down to byte-optimize-form-walker and compiler-macroexpand) things go badly awry. I have not hacked elisp for many a moon so I am lost, lost, lost. Any hints would be greatly appreciated. It took me most of a day to get this much information and I don't have a lot of time to go deeper, though I really want jdee to work with 23.
