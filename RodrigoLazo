Hi, my name is RodrigoLazo. I'm a proud user of emacs since 2004. I've
tried as many editors as you could imagine, but once I tried emacs for
real I get caught.  My favorites packages are [[EmacsLispScreen]],
[[DiredPlus]],[[JabberEl]],[[IteractivelyDoThings]], [[emacs-w3m]],
[[EmacsIRCClient]], [[Gnus]] and background.el that you can find here
http://www.jgk.org/src/background.el. The latter is a great package
that let you run commands asynchronusly.

==ElScreen==

[[EmacsLispScreen]] is indispensable for my daily work. In fact, many of the
elisp code I wrote is to better integrate it with the rest of emacs.

==Jabber==

I use jabber a lot, so I started to add some features to it. 

Sometimes I need to send the same message several times in a row, but
jabber.el lacked support for input history, so I wrote
Lisp:jabber-chatx.el

I also was used to the visual notifications other IM clients had, so I
wrote [[jabberLibnotify]] that supports pop-up notifications using
libnotify.

==Configuration==

This is my .emacs Lisp:rlazoDotEmacs.el
