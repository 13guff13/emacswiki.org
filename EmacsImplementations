Mainstream GNU Emacs and derivates:
* GnuEmacs
* [[XEmacs]] -- formerly LucidEmacs
* [[SXEmacs]] -- a fork of [[XEmacs]]

Other implementations still alive:
* GNU [[Zile]] -- a tiny Emacs clone.
* [[Climacs]] -- based on CommonLisp.
* EdWin -- based on [[Scheme]], included in GNU/MIT Scheme.
* EfunsEditor -- based on ObjectiveCaml.
* [[Mg]] -- a lightweight public domain Emacs clone
* [[Ymacs]] -- an Emacs-like editor for the Web

Other more or less obscure implementations:
* ErlangEmacs
* GuileEmacs
* JavaEmacs
* [[Jove]]
* MicroEmacs
* [[QEmacs]]
* Climacs, the Common Lisp Emacs
* Second Climacs (successor to Climacs, in development)

* [[PortableHemlock]]

Historic implementations and predecessors to modern Emacsen:
* TecoEmacs (one of the earliest implementations; RMS wrote his initial Editor MACroS in TECOs cryptic scripting language)
* [[EINE]] „EINE Is Not Emacs” (intended pun: eine is German for one)
* [[ZWEI]] „ZWEI Was EINE Initially” (intended pun: zwei is German for two)
* MulticsEmacs
* HemLock, included in CMU Common Lisp (often known as cmucl)
* [[Zmacs]]

Not locally documented:
* EmACT at http://www.eligis.com/emacs comes with Win32 binaries.
* PceEmacs at http://www.swi-prolog.org/PceEmacs.html

It is a pretty long page, though.

This document, by  CraigFinseth, provides a partial -- and not
comprehensive -- list of implementations of Emacs-type editors and
literature about such editors. You can help make it more comprehensive
by sending the author additional information and/or updates.

This document is also gradually acquiring the role of a repository of
(at least) Emacs-related history. While that subject requires a book
to itself, this document will probably serve until someone (<i>not</i>
the author!) writes one.
