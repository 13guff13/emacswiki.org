To read mail with VM from an IMAP spool, an entry specifying the
maildrop is needed in <code>vm-spool-files</code>. This can be
configured using, for example:

    (add-to-list 'vm-spool-files
                 '("~/mail/IMAP-INBOX"
                   "imap:HOST:PORT:MAILBOX:AUTH:USER:PASSWORD"
                   "~/mail/IMAP-INBOX.CRASH"))

where PORT is normally 143. To use IMAP over SSL, use, instead:

    (add-to-list 'vm-spool-files
                 '("~/mail/IMAP-INBOX"
                   "imap-ssl:HOST:PORT:MAILBOX:AUTH:USER:PASSWORD"
                   "~/mail/IMAP-INBOX.CRASH"))

where PORT is normally 993. In both cases, if PASSWORD is given as *,
it will be prompted for the first time that mail is retrieved.

By default, messages are removed from the IMAP server after retrieving
them. This is controlled by the variable
<code>vm-imap-expunge-after-retrieving</code>, but per-maildrop
settings can be made in <code>vm-imap-auto-expunge-alist</code>.

Other variables controlling IMAP behaviour include:

    vm-imap-bytes-per-session
    vm-imap-max-message-size
    vm-imap-messages-per-session
