tinydebian.el is part of the TinyTools.

== Overview ==

The package was originally developed to be a control interface to 
[http://www.debian.org/Bugs/ Debian Bug Tracking System]. The package contains two minor modes:
one for Gnus Summary buffer and one for standard mail modes (message-mode, mail-mode). From
each interface, complete bug management and manipulation can be done with few keystrokes and
menu commmands. Late in 2008, Emacs development team decided to evaluate and install Debian BTS (debbugs)
[http://emacsbugs.donarmstrong.com/ Emacs BTS], so the inetrface was extended to support multiple BTSs.

The  supported Bug tracking systems include:

* Debian BTS (full support)
* Emacs BTS (full support)
* Savannah trackers (only: jump to tracker)
* Savannah trackers (only: jump to tracker)
* Sourceforge bugs (only: jump to tracker)
* Gnome bugs (only: jump to tracker)
* Sourceware aka RedHat where various GNU projects like GDB are hosted (only: jump to tracker)

The interface is integrated to Gnus:

  M-x gnus
  <... as a Developer, go to your INBOX ...>
  <at Group buffer, move cursor to Subject indicating "Bug#NNNN">

Select desired management command from menu "Tdeb", or from prefix `C-c - C-h'.
Alternatively, start composing mail with `C-x m' and see menu "Tbts".

== Planned features ==

* Ubuntu launchpad.net bug tracking management

= Configuration =

Put the following in your ~/.emacs InitFile:

{{{
(setq tinydebian-:load-hook 'tinydebian-install)
(require 'tinydebian)
}}}

Instead of <code>require</code>, it is possisble to autoloads the code on demand:

{{{
(autoload 'turn-on-tinydebian-mail-mode "tinydebian")
(autoload 'tinydebian-find-file-hooks "tinydebian")
(autoload 'tinydebian-bts-mode-gnus-summary-maybe-turn-on "tinydebian")
(autoload 'tinydebian-bts-mode-maybe-turn-on "tinydebian")

(setq tinydebian-:load-hook 'tinydebian-install)

(add-hook 'message-mode-hook
          'turn-on-tinydebian-mail-mode)
(add-hook 'mail-mode-hook
          'turn-on-tinydebian-mail-mode)
(add-hook 'find-file-hooks
          'tinydebian-find-file-hooks)
(add-hook 'gnus-summary-prepare-hook
          'tinydebian-bts-mode-gnus-summary-maybe-turn-on)
(add-hook 'gnus-article-prepare-hook
          'tinydebian-bts-mode-maybe-turn-on)
}}}
