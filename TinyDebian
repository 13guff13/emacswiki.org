tinydebian.el is part of the TinyTools.

== Overview ==

The package was originally developed to be a control interface to 
[http://www.debian.org/Bugs/ Debian Bug Tracking System]. The package contains two minor modes:
one for Gnus Summary buffer and one for standard mail modes (message-mode, mail-mode). From
each interface, complete bug management and manipulation can be done with few keystrokes and
menu commmands.

Late in 2008, Emacs development team decided to evaluate and install Debian BTS (debbugs)
[http://emacsbugs.donarmstrong.com/ Emacs BTS].

The  supported Bug tracking systems include:

* Debian BTS
* Emacs BTS
* Savannah Site Request trackers (Savannah admin requests)
* Savannah bug reports (from projects)
* Sourceforge bugs (from packages)

The interface in integrated to Gnus:

  M-x gnus
  <... as a Developer, go to your INBOX ...>
  <at Group buffer, move cursor to Subject indicating "Bug#NNNN">

Select desired management command from menu "Tdeb", or from prefix `C-c - C-h'.
Alternatively, start composing mail with `C-x m' and see menu "Tbts".

== Planned features ==

* Ubuntu launchpad.net bug tracking management
