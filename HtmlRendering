shr.el is a HTML renderer in [[Gnus]]. It was added to Emacs 24.4. It is the basis of the [[eww]] web browser. http://bzr.savannah.gnu.org/lh/emacs/trunk/annotate/head:/lisp/net/shr.el

----

One of my big wishes is for good HTML rendering in elisp.  I'm starting this page to brainstorm solutions.  This is not about creating a browser.  This page is just about rendering.  I think the other pieces of a browser could be talked about elsewhere.  What I want is something that will render a buffer of html once it's been downloaded or render a region.  Uses for this are for handling html MimeTypesWithGnus, possibly EmacsIrcClient, or an AimClient.  There may be others, such as HttpGet.  These are the places where I can think of legitimate uses of html.

== The Basics =

Here's the minimum I'd like to see support for:

* Assume all docs are xhtml 1.0 transitional or html 4.01 transitional
** can add other DTDs later.
** severe handling of non-standards conforming pages
* handle <p>, </p>, <br />, <br>
* convert lists similar to the way WThreeM does ('*', '+', '-', etc.)
* convert b and strong tags into the bold-face
* convert i and em tags into the italics-face
* just display alt tag for <img ...> or some default for <img ...> with no alt tag


'''EDIT by ychaouche''' : I think HTML-mode handles this already, you can trigger it with '''C-c <tab>.'''

== The "Nice to Haves" =

Here are the things I think wouldn't be _that_ much extra work:

* handle the font tag to some degree.
** we can certainly handle the color attribute
** i'd ignore the size attribute
** maybe try to do some mapping of the family attribute
** other attributes as possible
* forms
** WThreeM handles forms fairly well.  Has some bugs.

== The "Hard to do" =

* tables
* frames
* CSS positionning, an increasing number of sites uses CSS for their
page layout.

The EmacsWebBrowser has code fragments, and a starting point is
available at Lisp:htmlr.el.

Features of htmlr.el: (support is to be read as "some support")

0.0.5 (07/04/2003) 
* support for dl dd dt tags
* fixes some newline problems
* other fixes

0.0.4 (04/04/2003) 
* support for h1..h6, ol tags  (titles use variable font size, hence Emacs 21, but text properties are in variables so you can change this easily)
* more style variables
* highlight for link and img tags
* more fixes

0.0.3 (02/04/2003)
* new parser attitude (it uses the stack for last tag)
* added the "convert lists similar to the way WThreeM does" feature
* lot of fixes

0.0.2 (27/03/2003)
* added whatever tag  to limit the complexity of the  definition 
of htmlr-transitions (I am still wondering if it is really a good idea).  
* support for links [src text]. better highlight needed.
* support for images {src (alt | name)} better highlight needed.
* support for i, em, hr, and br tags.
* parsing of attributes

0.0.1
* support for p, ul, li tags.
* html parser. (very nice)

Plans for next release
* look at what's going on when html code contains \r\n (dos encoding).
* I'll try to add some rendering for table

- not directly related to rendering
* see how to integrate it with http-get to help testing on more pages

I also plan to add htmrl.el to the cvs of http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/http-emacs/ with another ewtb.el (emacs www text browser) as soon as i implement
some basic features for it (follow link, perhaps back and forward). Please let me know if you want to have developer access. --PierreGaston
