This page is about displaying sequences of characters as fancy characters or symbols -- for example, showing ##->## as -->.

* PrettyLambda -- Show ##lambda## as the Greek letter.
* PrettyGreek -- Generalization of PrettyLambda for other Greek letters.
* TrentBuck's pretty symbols -- He says they horribly mess up wrapping (lines become too long) and alignment -- obvious if you do `##C-x v =##'.
