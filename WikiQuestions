----

'''Question:''' Is there a way to provide different text for a link?

'''Answer:''' See the next question.

----

'''Question:''' Is there an analogue for "piped links" that are available at WikiPedia (also similar to CleanLinking or FreeLinks)?

##[WikiQuestions Wiki questions]## -> [WikiQuestions Wiki questions] (if a CamelCase Link)
and
##[[News|Emacs Wiki News]]## -> [[News|Emacs Wiki News]] (for everything else).

'''Question:''' Is there a way to search all edits by a user?

'''Answer:''' Yes there is -- on RecentChanges, you can filter by user, host or IP.  Together with some other parameters for OtherRecentChanges, you can for example show a list of all contributions Alex ever made:

* EmacsWiki:action=rc;all=1;showedit=1;from=1;rcuseronly=AlexSchroeder

----

'''Question:''' On RecentChanges, is there a way to see all the recent non-minor (See MinorEdit) changes to a file, rather than just the most recent change?

'''Answer:''' Yes, there is.  On RecentChanges, click on the link "[EmacsWiki:action=rc;all=1 show all changes]".


----

'''Question:''' I want my own wiki. Where do I get started?


'''Answer:''' Check out the [http://www.wikimatrix.org/ Wiki Matrix] or [http://www.communitywiki.org/odd Oddwiki].

----

'''Question:'''  Can I retrieve parts of EmacsWiki with a network distributed VersionControl system like DaRcs, SubVersion or [[CVS]]?

'''Answer:''' (Feb 2009): yes, see [[WikiDownload]]. There is a [[SVN repository]].
----

'''Question:'''  Do per page RSS feeds work properly in Emacs Wiki? They seem to return some content when subscribing, but there is no update afterwards even if the page is changed several times.

'''Answer:''' Do you have an example? I guess it depends on your feed reader. On most feed readers, these changes will show up as updates to an existing article, so if your feed reader ignores updates, you won't see it. In that case, try using all=1 to get a feed of all edits, not just the latest one. Here's an example:

http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki?action=rss;rcidonly=SiteMap;all=1;days=14

----

'''Question:'''  When reading recent changes via RSS, both the diff and the page itself are included in the item. This doesn’t work well for big pages, because they show up as “This page is too big send over RSS.” in the RSS output. Is there a different RSS feed which includes only the difference and the link to the page?

'''Answer:''' Try this feed:

http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/?action=rss;full=1;diff=1;page=0;title=Diff%20Only

For more parameters with which to tweak the feed to your liking, check out [[Oddmuse:Rss Action]].
