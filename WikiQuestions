----

'''Question:''' Is there a way to provide different text for a link?

'''Answer:''' See the next question.

----

'''Question:''' Is there an analogue for "piped links" that are available at WikiPedia (also similar to CleanLinking or FreeLinks)?

and
##[[News|Emacs Wiki News]]## -> [[News|Emacs Wiki News]] (for everything else).

'''Question:''' Is there a way to search all edits by a user?

'''Answer:''' Yes there is -- on RecentChanges, you can filter by user, host or IP.  Together with some other parameters for OtherRecentChanges, you can for example show a list of all contributions Alex ever made:

* EmacsWiki:action=rc;all=1;showedit=1;from=1;rcuseronly=AlexSchroeder

----

'''Question:''' On RecentChanges, is there a way to see all the recent non-minor (See MinorEdit) changes to a file, rather than just the most recent change?

'''Answer:''' Yes, there is.  On RecentChanges, click on the link "[EmacsWiki:action=rc;all=1 show all changes]".


----

'''Question:''' I want my own wiki. Where do I get started?


'''Answer:''' Check out the [http://www.wikimatrix.org/ Wiki Matrix] or [http://www.communitywiki.org/odd Oddwiki].

----

'''Question:'''  Can I retrieve parts of EmacsWiki with a network distributed VersionControl system like DaRcs, SubVersion or [[CVS]]?

'''Answer:''' (Feb 2009): yes, see [[WikiDownload]]. There is a [[SVN repository]].

'''Question:'''  Do per page RSS feeds work properly in Emacs Wiki? They seem to return some content when subscribing, but there is no update afterwards even if the page is changed several times.

'''Answer:''' Do you have an example? I guess it depends on your feed reader. On most feed readers, these changes will show up as updates to an existing article, so if your feed reader ignores updates, you won't see it. In that case, try using all=1 to get a feed of all edits, not just the latest one. Here's an example:

http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki?action=rss;rcidonly=SiteMap;all=1;days=14

'''Question:'''  I thought I'd like to include code snippets using githubs 'gist'.  
These can be embedded in html with code like:

  <script src="https://gist.github.com/783351.js"> </script>

But raw html isn't enabled on this wiki. Is there any other way I can include the  
gist snippet (preferably with the same javascript).

'''Answer:'''
[new]
Note that allowing someone to add a <script> on a publicly editable wiki is a security hole. The script inherits all the capabilities of the hosting page (such as cookies, logins, etc.) and can send them to a third party site. For example someone can edit a page to include a <script> that captures the admin login, and then that person has admin access to the entire site. There are projects like Caja that aim to allow limited scripts but this wiki software doesn't include support for it.
[new]
True, but enabling RawHtml surely isn't neccesary? Couldn't an exception be made for certain scripts, such as the one from github, and wiki-syntax that resolves to this script be programmed in?
