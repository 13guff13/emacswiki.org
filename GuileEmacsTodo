This is a child-page of GuileEmacs

== List ==
* Compact buffers after GC. (Perhaps using [http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.diffs/115317])
* Undo list truncation
* Shrink regexp cache after GC
* GC messages
* Automatic deletion of undo list elements updating freed markers
* '''DONE''' Fix backtraces ''(fixed Vlexical_binding bug)''
* '''DONE''' Use Guile facilities for control flow
* QUIT at each SCM_TICK
* '''DONE''' Use guile-snarf for subr definition
* Installation instructions
* Debugging instructions
* Eliminate forwarded variables (either use normal variables or implement symbol macros)
* '''DONE''' Remove unnecessary signal handlers (notably SIGXCPU, SIGPWR which bdw-gc uses)
* '''DONE''' Fix EMACS_INT formatting
* Find beta testers for non-GNU platforms
* Test gdb configuration
* '''DONE''' Fix [http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=14120] (reported by TaylanUB)
* '''DONE''' Fix hashing. <code>(let ((table (make-hash-table :test 'equal))) (puthash "1234567890" "foo" table) (gethash "1234567890" table)) => nil</code>. Some other (most?) keys work; I couldn't see a pattern in what does and doesn't work. If you use the same object for both keys (i.e. they're `eq') then it seems to always work, so don't let-bind keys if you want to test this.
* '''DONE''' Smob equality
* '''DONE''' Smob printing
* '''DONE''' Use libguile hash functions
* Use libguile hash tables
* '''DONE''' Fix profiler.c
* remove unexec support code
* '''DONE''' Test non-gtk x toolkits
* '''DONE''' Update nextstep support
* Test mingw build

== User-visible issues ==

wip-bdw-gc branch:
# Start-up takes long because dumping doesn't work. (Tip: During compilation, use another Emacs to byte-compile .el files, or it will take hours/days because each guilemacs instance takes so long to start.)
# There seem to be memory leaks, or another reason which causes the GC to exhaust the heap, usually resulting in a segfault.
