The '''Thrush''' operators of Clojure, ##->>## and ##->##, let one chain functions together. For example,

    (->> (seq accounts)
         (filter #(= (:type %) 'savings))
         (map :balance)
         (apply +))

expands to

    (apply +
      (map :balance
        (filter #(= (:type %) 'savings)
          (seq accounts))))

== Elisp implementation ==

The following macros implement Thrush operators in Emacs Lisp.

    (defmacro ->> (&rest body)
      (let ((result (pop body)))
        (dolist (form body result)
          (setq result (append form (list result))))))

    (defmacro -> (&rest body)
      (let ((result (pop body)))
        (dolist (form body result)
          (setq result (append (list (car form) result)
                               (cdr form))))))
