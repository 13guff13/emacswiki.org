My personal web site utilizes some emacs code that might interest folks here. It's dead simple, but that is the beauty of it IMHO. The code is in the "jBlog" section of the following link. The download contains the PHP code for the site including the corresponding elisp for content. Comments, additions, fixes, etc. always welcome.

Thanks to all here for the great info.

Welcome to the wiki! Collecting useful stuff is our mission. You didn't actually link to the "dead simple" Emacs code, did you? I looked at your code page and didn't find what I was looking for. I ended up on your copy of the ElispCookbook. :) -- AlexSchroeder

Thanks for the greeting and also for pointing out that I wasn't very clear with where that elisp code was lurking. Hopefully I've corrected that above.
