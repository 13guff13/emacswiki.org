Hi,

I'm Francesc Rocher. I used Emacs in the late 80's at the university, under VMS. During some time I used Jed and other editors and IDE's. I lacked the power of Emacs, so I switched to XEmacs and finally again to Emacs.

Things I use it for:

* Write C/C++ programs, using [[ECB]]

* Compile/debug programs and scritps

* Perform control version tasks using CVS, subversion or mercurial: checkout, commit, tag, annotate, diff, merge, log, etc

* Maintain some <tt>Makefile</tt> files

* Read <tt>info</tt> and <tt>man</tt> pages

* Surf the net using WThreeM
