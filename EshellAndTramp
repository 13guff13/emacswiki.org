I'd like to start this node with a question:

I use TrampMode instead of AngeFtp. I cannot, however, see the output of remote commands [ran whilst in a remote directory ie on a remote host] in the eshell buffer.

Kai Gro√üjohann had inquired about the same issue on tramp-devel/2002-09: 

http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/tramp-devel/2002-09/msg00121.html

I was wondering if there is a simple way [ie a simple change or setting in either eshell or tramp] which inserts the output a remote command into the current eshell buffer...
