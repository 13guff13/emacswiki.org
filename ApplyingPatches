There aren't many powerfully useful documents introducing patches to an EmacsNewbie.  Its more often a required trade of software package maintainers and developers.  However, the skill can be as useful to every day users ("the emacsen laity").

The ##patch## command is well documented, however, but mostly for an audience of those who already understand and use patches.

And also DiffMode and [[Ediff]] are well documented for Emacs.
