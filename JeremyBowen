Hi,

I've been an Emacs user since about 18.5X, initially under OS/2 but now primarily under GNU/Linux.

My claim to Emacs fame is my updating of the OS/2 port of Emacs to v20.3 & v20.6. 
Unfortunately I have not worked on this code since 2001 and no longer have an OS/2 machine to develop on.

Using my OS/2 port is described by OliverHeidelbach here: http://home.snafu.de/ohei/emacs/emacs206-os2.html
