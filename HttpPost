The code on this page is ideal for web services, where you need to
interface to the web, but you don't really need HTML rendering.
Just as HttpGet makes HTTP GET requests, the code on this page
makes HTTP POST requests.

* [http://savannah.nongnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/*checkout*/http-emacs/http-emacs/http-post.el?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/plain http-post.el] HEAD version from [https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/http-emacs/ http-emacs] project at [https://savannah.nongnu.org Savannah] (non-GNU).
* Lisp:http-post-curl.el - adds curl support for https urls
* Lisp:http-post-simple.el - POST support, including multipart, using the UrlPackage.

See HttpGet.

See also the UrlPackage which is now part of Emacs and provides support for authentication and cookies. It can do POST requests, for example:

        (let ((url-request-method        "POST")
	      (url-request-extra-headers `(("Content-Type" . "application/x-www-form-urlencoded")))
	      (url-request-data          "field1=Hello&field2=from&field3=Emacs"))
	  (with-current-buffer (url-retrieve-synchronously url)
            (buffer-string)))
