My name is Matthew Snyder. I write about Lisp and Emacs at http://msnyder.info.

* Yaoddmuse doesn't allow creating pages.
* Starting a comment with [<nowiki>new::</nowiki>] doesn't add the user's name and the timestamp to the visible HTML output.
* Something about being able to actually track bugs with ElispArea code.
* Should discussions on pages be moved to their respective <nowiki>Comments_on_ pages</nowiki>? I really wish that prefix was `Talk:` or something. It'd be so much cleaner.
