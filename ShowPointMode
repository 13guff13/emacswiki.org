Lisp:show-point-mode.el

A simple minor mode to display the value of point in the mode line. It is displayed in brackets, adjacent to the line and/or column number if those are being displayed.

I find this useful when debugging elisp code that uses buffer positions, markers and overlays.

Please send bug reports and suggestions to [mailto:toby-predictive@dr-qubit.org toby-predictive@dr-qubit.org] (you can post them here as well if you like, of course). I don't check this page regularly, so anything not emailed to me is likely to languish here unnoticed for some time.
