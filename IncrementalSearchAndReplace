CategorySearchAndReplace covers this in a single sentance quite nicely.


IncrementalSearch in allows you to interactively start a `query-replace' (or `query-replace-regexp') session using the current search string (or regular expression) providing roughly an "Incremental replace" feature. The default keybinds are ##`M-%'## (or ##`C-M-%'##) after starting Isearch.
