I've been using Emacs since 2006. I cannot imagine to live without it :-)

I use Emacs for:
* programming languages: python, felt, matlab/octave, castem, elisp, LaTeX with Auctex
* git-emacs
* dired mode
* ediff
* muse mode (my website)
* org mode (gtd)
* gnus
* etc.

Currently I live in Varese, Italy (however I'm from Opole, Poland).
