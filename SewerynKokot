I've been using Emacs for 2 years and I wish I had found out about Emacs earlier. I cannot imagine to live without it.

I use Emacs for:
* programming languages: python, felt, matlab/octave, castem, elisp, LaTeX with Auctex
* git-emacs
* dired mode
* ediff
* muse mode (my website)
* org mode (gtd)
* gnus
* etc.

I live in Opole, Poland.
