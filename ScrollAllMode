Use M-x scroll-all-mode to scroll multiple buffers together.

Very useful for visually comparing two files which are hard to diff becase of lots of trivial changes amongst the changes you are looking for.

It seems that scrolling by lines works fine, but scrolling by pages
still has bugs.

This is fixed in CVS now (May '02).

Rather annoying that it doesn't seem to work with the mouse wheel (or anything other than the cursor keys) on Gnu emacs 21.3.
