Use M-x scroll-all-mode to scroll multiple buffers together.

Very useful for visually comparing two files which are hard to diff becase of lots of trivial changes amongst the changes you are looking for.

==Limitations==
It doesn't work with the mouse wheel or scroll-bar (tested on both GNU Emacs 21.3 and 24.2.1).

In emacs before 2002, scrolling by full pages was buggy.
