JohnMcCarthy died on 2011-10-23.  He is most well-known for his ideas behind symbolic programming and [[Lisp]].  He created ProjectMac there, together with MarvinMinsky.  Lisp became a veritable force in artificial intelligence research.  MacLisp was later developed at MIT, and it directly influenced CommonLisp and EmacsLisp.

!McCarthy began Stanford AI Lab ([[http://ai.stanford.edu/ SAIL]]), which developed a timesharing operating system on the PDP-1 and later its own editor for the system, called '''E'''.  In 1976, RichardStallman visited SAIL and was impressed by the editor's features.  He returned to MIT and implemented realtime editing in [[TECO]].  These features would also later be incorporated in Emacs.

JamieZawinski has passed along an [[XEmacs]]-related story about jmc.
