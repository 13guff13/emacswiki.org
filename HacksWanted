If you're wanting to learn Emacs or EmacsLisp you could do worse than finding a bunch of things to hack on and hacking on them.

Here's a list of people and projects you could hack on:

* GnuEmacs [http://debbugs.gnu.org/db/ix/full.html
 bugs] needing fixing (in many cases there is a patch to apply or the fix is otherwise simple). 
* [[Fuco]] has stuff in [[https://github.com/Fuco1/litable/blob/master/litable.el#L248|litable]] that you could do
* NicFerrier has stuff in [[https://github.com/nicferrier/elwikicreole/blob/master/creole.el|WikiCreole]], we need to add lots of OddMuse support
