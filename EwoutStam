* I use Emacs
* I've started using Emacs because I wanted to speed up editing stuff. Not having to move my hands from the home row was the biggest reason to change, and if I ever got serious about Emacs I could do lots of things with it, almost without boundaries as I can extend it myself if I really want to.
* I've got my own [http://teraiten.vze.com website], which is a statified wiki, but not an EmacsWiki. But I'd like to change that. In fact, I'm working on it now but it doesn't have any serious priority  ;)

==Tips for beginners==

Here's what I did in order to learn Emacs:

* Take a screwdriver and flip out the arrow keys. You are now forcing yourself to use the keybinds. Revert to the numpad in an emergency.
* If you want simplicity for starters, use [http://zile.sourceforge.net/ Zile]. It has a little on screen mini-help thingy too. Runs in a terminal window so you can configure your fonts by configuring the terminal program. Or start emacs in a console by entering <code>emacs -nw</code>.
* Take a permanent marker and write on your keyboard. Preferably the front and not the top of the keys, because permanent markers aren't that permanent at all :-/ Now you can just look at your keyboard if you forget how to do something. I wrote little arrows and stuff, which I find more pleasant to use than a cheat sheet.
* LongLines - Get it. It makes Emacs behave like windows notepad when it wraps text. And this is exactly what I need. I organize my homework in a wiki, and all I need is any random editor which accepts plaintext. Notepad was preferred above emacs simply because it wraps lines better. I used XKeymacs in combination with notepad for my work, and this made windows the prefered platform of choice, as I didn't have XKeymacs for linux. Till I got this.
* To make LongLines act even more like notepad (wrapping where the window ends, not on a pre-set margin) add the following to your <code>.emacs</code>:
<pre>
(setq longlines-wrap-follows-window-size t)
(setq window-min-width 1)
</pre>
* If you use emacs for editing text (not code) and you're pretty new to emacs in general, have a look at http://www.therandymon.com/papers/emacs-for-writers.pdf
