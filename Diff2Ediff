AlexSchroeder has found it convenient to have this command
for DiffMode (`diff-mode' provides only `diff-goto-source'):

{{{
(defun diff-2-ediff ()
  "invoke ediff on the context of 2 files in diff-mode"
  (interactive)
  ;; A
  (destructuring-bind (buf-A line-offset pos old new &optional switched)
      (diff-find-source-location 't nil)
    ;; B
    (destructuring-bind (buf-B line-offset pos old new &optional switched)
      (diff-find-source-location nil nil)
      (ediff-buffers buf-A buf-B))))
}}}

[new]
How is this supposed to be used, and what does it do?  My understanding is it
takes the region of a diff and runs Ediff on it. 

I just noticed a similar function in [CVS:diff-mode.el?rev=HEAD diff-mode.el] called `diff-ediff-patch'. -- AaronHawley
