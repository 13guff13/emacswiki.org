This is a collection of ideas for Emacs features which could be implemented with crowdfunding.



= Why crowdfunding? =

Currently, Emacs is developed in a volunteer model: people work in their freetime on features and they are not paid for their work. This model works, Emacs is being developed. The problem is some features are not implemented in this model, because they either take too much time or effort to implement properly, so it's not enough to work on them in one's free time.

The solution is crowdfunding. A developer proposes to implement a feature, describes what he wants to implement, how much time he needs and how much compensation he requires to do it in order to make a living while he's working on the feature. The users who are interested in the feature and want it to be implemented pledge money for the cause if they trust the developer (so the developer is better be somebody who can show some credentials, previous projects to prove he can do the job). If enough money is pledged and the funding goal is met then the developer can start working on the feature preferably with regular updates to let the users know about the progress of the project. If not enough money is pledged then the money is refunded to the users.

Emacs has lots of users and there are missing features which lots of users would love to see implemented, so this development model may work for Emacs too. For a discussion of this model see [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.devel/149738 this thread] and  [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.devel/149916 this one].


= What are these crowdfunding sites? =


There are several:

* [http://www.kickstarter.com/ Kickstarter] (the best known)
* [http://www.indiegogo.com/ IndieGogo]
* and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Crowd_funding others] (feel free to list other sites here if you know about them).



= What are those missing features which people want? =


Is there something you miss from Emacs? Then feel free to list it here, so potential developers have a list of wanted features to choose from.  The main criteria for such a feature that it should be wanted by lots of people, so a crowdfunding project for the feature can be successful.

The list below is only an example. Add your own features and add subfeatures to the existing ones if you have more/better ideas. You can also pick suitable candidates from the WishList and put them here.

== Coding support ==

=== Java ===
* Eclipse-like [http://goo.gl/mJf7o QuickAssist].
* Eclipse-like [http://goo.gl/tYnc1 QuickFix]
* Eclipse-like [http://goo.gl/9k3ld overriding/implementing methods]
* Make java-mode aware of generics for syntax highlighting

== add more features here ==

=== Common Lisp ===

* Completely rewrite Emacs in Common Lisp instead of C+Elisp.


=== Guile ===

* Get Emacs to run on the Guile VM
