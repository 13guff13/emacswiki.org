This page is about library <tt>[[isearch+.el]]</tt>, written by DrewAdams. This extends standard Emacs library ##isearch.el##, which provides IncrementalSearch.

Features:

* New option and commands to let you select the last target occurrence (set the [[region]] around it):
** Option '''`isearchp-set-region-flag'''' -- Non-`nil' means automatically set the region around the last search target.
** Command '''`isearchp-toggle-set-region'''', bound to
'''`C-SPC'''' during isearch -- toggle `isearchp-set-region-flag'.
** Command '''`set-region-around-search-target'''' -- manually set the region around the last search target.

* New command and binding to toggle (incremental) word search (from JuriLinkov): `isearch-toggle-word', bound to '''`M-w''''.

* New bindings during Isearch (the standard bindings for some of these use the Meta modifier, `M-',  instead):
** '''`next'''', '''`prior'''' repeat the last Isearch forward and backward (easier than using the [[chord]]s `C-s', `C-r'.
** '''`C-h'''' provides ''help'' on Isearch while isearching. Library <tt>[[isearch+.el]]</tt> also redefines `isearch-mode-help' so that it lists ''all'' Isearch bindings and ends Isearch properly
** '''`C-t'''' lets you toggle between [[regular expression]] isearching and normal isearching. (Standard binding `M-r'.)
** '''`C-c'''' lets you toggle ''case-sensitivity'' while isearching. (Standard binding `M-c'.)
** '''`C-SPC'''' lets you toggle setting the region around the last found occurrence.
** '''`C-end'''' -- go to the longest line. Repeat to go to the longest line following that one in the buffer. As usual, `C-g' puts you back where you started. This binding is made only if you also use library <tt>[[misc-cmds.el]]</tt>. See [[FindLongLines#goto-longest-line|Find Long Lines]].

* Highlighting of the failed portion of your search string in the [[minibuffer]]-- that is, the portion that will be removed if you do `C-g'. (I added this feature to vanilla Emacs in release 23.1.)

* `M-e' during Isearch edit (that is, after `M-e' -- so `M-e M-e') moves the [[cursor]] between the match success and fail positions of the search string. This lets you quickly change a character or two that you mistyped at that position.

'''See Also:'''

* '''ReplacePlus''' for related extensions to Emacs' standard `query-replace'. In particular, the ability to select (put the [[region]] around) the last replacement.
* '''ThingAtPointCommands''' for commands to extend the region around different things near [[point]]. You can use it to extend the search-target region.
* '''[[Icicles - Icompletion#HighlightNonmatch|Icicles Icompletion]]''' for similar highlighting of the non-matching portion of your input during [[completion]].
