This page is about '''[::Isearch+]''', that is,  library '''<tt>[[isearch+.el]]</tt>''' and its companion library '''<tt>[[isearch-prop.el]]</tt>'''.  These libraries extend standard Emacs library ##isearch.el##, which provides IncrementalSearch.  (Neither of these extension libraries requires the other. They are complementary, but they enhance each other.)

----

<tt>[[isearch+.el]]</tt> Features:

* Case-sensitivity is indicated in the [[mode line]] minor-mode lighter: '''`ISEARCH'''' for case-insensitive; '''`Isearch'''' for case-sensitive.

* Highlighting of the mode-line [[minor mode]] lighter (indicator) when search has wrapped around (Emacs 24+ only).

* Highlighting of parts of the prompt, to indicate the type of
search: regexp, word, multiple-buffer, and whether searching has
wrapped around the buffer (Emacs 22+ only).


[:isearchp-restrict-to-region-flag]
[:isearchp-deactivate-region-flag]
* Optional restriction of search to the [[active region]], controlled by option '''`isearchp-restrict-to-region-flag''''.  Deactivation of the active region, controlled by option
'''`isearchp-deactivate-region-flag''''.  Both of these are available
for Emacs 24.3 and later.  You can use '''`C-x n'''' (command '''`isearchp-toggle-region-restriction'''') during search to toggle `isearchp-restrict-to-region-flag'.

[:modeline-position]
[:query-replace]
* If you use library ModeLinePosition (<tt>[[modeline-posn.el]]</tt> then not only can you restrict Isearch to the active region but you can keep that restriction when you invoke a query-replacement command from Isearch (e.g. `M-%' from Isearch, to use `query-replace'). The main job of that library is to show information about the active region in the [[mode line]].  And whenever you invoke a replacement command or Isearch for the active region, that region information is highlighted specially. See ModeLinePosition for screenshots and more info.


[:isearchp-set-region-flag]
[:isearchp-toggle-set-region]
[:set-region-around-search-target]
* [[option|Option]] and commands to let you select the last target occurrence (set the [[region]] around it):
** Option '''`isearchp-set-region-flag'''' -- Non-`nil' means automatically set the region around the last search target.
** Command `isearchp-toggle-set-region', bound to
'''`C-SPC'''' during isearch -- toggle `isearchp-set-region-flag'.
** Command '''`set-region-around-search-target'''' -- manually set the region around the last search target.




[:isearchp-act-on-demand]
[:isearchp-on-demand-action-function]
* When you visit a search hit, you can perform an ''action'' on it.
Use '''`C-M-RET'''' (command `isearchp-act-on-demand' -- Emacs 22+
only) to invoke the action function that is the value of option
'''`isearchp-on-demand-action-function''''.  That function is passed
the current search-hit string and its start and end positions in
the buffer.  Search moves to the next hit in the same search
direction, so just repeating `C-M-RET' carries out the action on
subsequent hits.



[:isearchp-replace-on-demand]
* The default value of `isearchp-on-demand-action-function' is
function `isearchp-replace-on-demand', which ''replaces the search
hit''.  This means that you can replace (or delete) chosen search
hits on demand.
By default, the replacement string is empty, so with no prefix
argument the action is to ''delete'' the search hit (replace it with
nothing).


* With a [[prefix argument]], `isearchp-replace-on-demand' ('''`C-M-RET'''') prompts for the
replacement, which is used thereafter until you again use a
prefix arg.  Since you can use a prefix arg at any time, you can
provide ''different replacements'' for different search hits.  When
prompted, if you clear the minibuffer and hit `RET', hit
replacement just becomes search-hit ''deletion''.
['''NOTE:''' To use a prefix arg within Isearch, you must set
'''`isearch-allow-prefix'''' (if available) or '''`isearch-allow-scroll''''
to non-`nil'.]

** With a ''plain'' prefix arg ('''`C-u'''') or a numeric prefix arg of
value '''1''' (e.g. `C-1'), `isearchp-replace-on-demand' replaces
only the current search hit.

** With a ''negative'' prefix arg (e.g. '''`M--''''),
`isearchp-replace-on-demand' changes searching so that it also
replaces.  That is, the search key (e.g., `C-s') then acts the
same as `C-M-RET'.  (You can cancel this by using a
non-negative prefix arg or by quitting and restarting
Isearch.)

** With a ''positive'' prefix arg ''N'' (e.g. `C-8' or `C-u 200'),
`isearchp-replace-on-demand' replaces ''N'' search hits (but it
stops at the search limit, if reached).

** With a ''zero'' prefix arg (e.g. `C-0'),
`isearchp-replace-on-demand' replaces ''all'' remaining search
hits (up to the search limit).


* When you use on-demand replacement (with `C-M-RET') the replacement text can be either inserted literally, as is, or interpreted as in `query-replace-regexp'.  In the latter case, you can use `##\&##', `##\=\N##', `##\###', `##\,##' and `##\?##'.

** For example, suppose you use a regexp-search pattern of ##`\(e\)\|a'## and a replacement pattern of ##`\,(if \1 "a" "e")'##.  Each `C-M-RET' will then swap `e' for `a' and vice versa.

** See the doc for `query-replace-regexp' and node `Regexp Replace' of the Emacs manual for more information.

** (Note that `##\?##' is supported, but it is not very useful in this context, because it prompts you to edit the result each time you hit `C-M-RET'.  Instead, use `C-u C-M-RET' whenever you want to change (edit) the replacement pattern.)


[:isearchp-toggle-literal-replacement]
* You can use `##C-M-`##' (`isearchp-toggle-literal-replacement') anytime during Isearch to toggle whether replacement text is used literally or interpreted per the special regexp-replacement constructs.

** Note that the use of the special regexp replacement patterns is unrelated to the kind of incremental search: literal string search or regexp search.  Just remember that the way to switch on/off the special behavior of `##\&##' and so on is to use `##C-M-`##'.


[:isearchp-noprompt-action-function]
* The value of variable `isearchp-noprompt-action-function' is a function that is invoked automatically, after you visit each search hit.  The function is called with no arguments.  It cannot use the minibuffer, but it can modify buffer contents.  The variable is reset to `nil' when you quit Isearch.  As an example of use, command `isearchp-replace-on-demand' with a negative prefix arg sets this to `isearchp-replace-match', which causes automatic replacement each time you visit a search hit.


[:isearchp-nomodify-action-hook]
* Hook `isearchp-nomodify-action-hook' (Emacs 22+ only) is also run after each search visit.  Its functions also must accept the same arguments as `isearchp-act-on-demand'.  The functions can use the minibuffer, but they must not update the buffer text (in a way noticeable by Isearch), or else that will likely lead to a call-stack overflow.  This is because they are called with Isearch suspended during `isearch-update' (which can itself be invoked by the action...).





[:isearchp-regexp-quote-yank-flag]
[:isearchp-toggle-regexp-quote-yank]
* [[option|Option]] ('''`isearchp-regexp-quote-yank-flag'''') and command (`isearchp-toggle-regexp-quote-yank', bound to '''`##C-`##'''') to toggle quoting (escaping) of [[regexp]] special characters.  With escaping turned off, you can yank text such as ##^\*.*## without it being transformed to ##\^\\\*\.\*##.




[:isearchp-eval-sexp-and-insert]
* '''`##M-:##'''' ('''`isearchp-eval-sexp-and-insert'''') prompts you for a Lisp
[[sexp]], evaluates it, and appends the value to the search string.
This is useful, for example, to use `rx' or another
regexp-creation helper to create a [[regexp]] search pattern.
For example: `##C-M-s M-: (rx (and line-start (1+ (in "("))))##'
searches using the result of that `rx' sexp, which is ##"^(+"##.
(The double-quote chars are removed.)
Remember too that you can use '''`##C-u M-:##'''' after '''`M-e''''.  That
inserts the sexp value into the [[minibuffer]], where you are
editing the search string.  Use this when you do not want to
simply append the sexp value to the search string, but instead you want
to do some editing of it or the rest of the search string.




[:isearchp-retrieve-last-quit-search]
* '''`M-g'''' ('''`isearchp-retrieve-last-quit-search'''') yanks the last successful search string (regexp or plain) from when you last hit `C-g' in Isearch.  Sometimes you search for something but abandon the search --- you just want to check the locations of something, without staying at any of them.  Afterward, if you want to find them again, use `M-g'.  This yanks that search string, so you can append it to whatever you are already searching for.

[:isearchp-append-register]
* '''`C-x r g'''' ('''`isearchp-append-register'''') appends the contents of a
[[register]] to the search string.  You are prompted for the
register to use.  This is the same key that is bound globally to
`insert-register'.  If you want this key to instead exit Isearch and
insert the register in the buffer, then define this key in
`isearch-mode-map' as `nil` (i.e., unbind it), and optionally bind
`isearchp-append-register' to a different key in
`isearch-mode-map'.

[:isearch-yank-secondary]
* '''`C-M-y'''' ('''`isearch-yank-secondary'''') yanks the [[secondary selection]] onto the search string, if you also use library <tt>[[second-sel.el]]</tt> (see [[SecondarySelection#secondary-sel.el|secondary selection enhancements]]).

[:isearchp-yank-char]
* '''`##C-c##'''' ('''`isearchp-yank-char'''') yanks successive characters onto the search string.

[:isearchp-yank-symbol-or-char]
* '''`##C-_##'''' ('''`isearchp-yank-symbol-or-char'''') yanks successive [[symbol]]s (or words or subwords or chars) onto the search string.

[:isearchp-yank-sexp-symbol-or-char]
* '''`##C-(##'''' ('''`isearchp-yank-sexp-symbol-or-char'''') yanks successive [[sexp]]s (or symbols or words or subwords or chars) onto the search string.


[:isearchp-kill-ring-save]
* '''`M-w'''' (`isearchp-kill-ring-save') copies the current search string to the [[kill ring]].  You can then, for example, use `C-s M-y' to search for the same
thing in another Emacs session.  (I use this all the time, but you might not use multiple Emacs sessions.)  Note that if you did not have this feature then you would need to select the search-string text (in the text buffer or in the `M-e' Isearch edit buffer) and copy it to the kill ring.  (Note: `M-w' used to toggle word search, but `isearch-toggle-word' is now `M-s w'.)

* All commands that yank text onto the search string are bound to keys with prefix `C-y' (in addition to any other Isearch bindings):

     C-y C-_   isearchp-yank-symbol-or-char
     C-y C-(   isearchp-yank-sexp-symbol-or-char
     C-y C-2   isearch-yank-secondary
     C-y C-c   isearchp-yank-char
     C-y C-e   isearchp-yank-line
     C-y C-w   isearchp-yank-word-or-char
     C-y C-y   isearch-yank-kill
     C-y M-y   isearch-yank-pop

:: You can repeat any of these for which it makes sense (i.e., all except `isearch-yank-secondary', `isearch-yank-kill', and `isearch-yank-pop') by just repeating the last key.  For example: `C-y C-e C-e C-e' adds the text up to the end of three lines.

[:isearch-char-by-name]
* '''`C-x 8 RET'''' ('''`isearch-char-by-name'''') reads the name of a Unicode character with
completion and appends it to the search string.  Same thing when
editing the search string (i.e., after `M-e').  This is part of GnuEmacs starting with Emacs 24.4.

[:isearchp-open-recursive-edit]
* '''`C-x o'''' ('''`isearchp-open-recursive-edit'''') opens a recursive editing session, where you can do
anything you like (including search for something different).
Using '''`C-M-c'''' closes the recursive editing session and resumes
the search (from the current position when you hit `C-M-c').

* `C-g' after successfully finding matches restores not only the original position but also its relative position in the window.  IOW, you get back to what you saw before searching.  Fixes GnuEmacs [[http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=12253|bug #12253]] for Isearch.

* Highlighting of the mismatched portion of your search string. This is the portion that is removed if you do `C-g', or removed/replaced manually if you use `C-M-l' (see next) or automatically if you use `M-k' (see below).  I added this feature to GnuEmacs 23.1.

[:isearchp-remove-failed-part]
* '''`C-M-l'''' ('''`isearchp-remove-failed-part'''') removes the failed part of the search string, if any.  `C-g' does this as well, but
`C-g' also has an effect when search is successful.

[:isearchp-cycle-mismatch-removal]
[:isearchp-drop-mismatch]
* '''`M-k'''' ('''`isearchp-cycle-mismatch-removal'''') cycles automatic removal or replacement of the input portion
that does not match.  The behavior
is controlled by the value of option '''`isearchp-drop-mismatch'''':

** `replace-last' -- Your current input ''replaces'' the last mismatched text.  You can always see your last input, even if it is a mismatch.  And it is available for editing using `M-e'.

** `nil'  -- Your current input is ''appended'', even if the
previous input has a mismatched portion.

** anything else -- Your current input is ''ignored'' (removed) if it causes a mismatch.  The search string always has
successful matches.


[:isearchp-ring-bell-function]
* You can use option '''`isearchp-ring-bell-function'''' to suppress or
replace bell ringing (`ding') during Isearch (but not for
quitting with `C-g').  Set it to `ignore', for example, to
suppress any indication of an error.  Set it to a function such
as `echo-bell' (from library <tt>[[echo-bell.el]]</tt>), to indicate errors
only visually.

[:isearchp-toggle-option-flag]
* Non-`nil' option '''`isearchp-toggle-option-flag'''', which you can
toggle using '''`M-s v'''' (`isearchp-toggle-option-toggle'),
determines whether commands that toggle behavior also toggle an
associated user option.  For such commands, a [[prefix argument]]
flips the behavior, as if `isearchp-toggle-option-flag' were
toggled temporarily.  Currently this feature applies to toggles
'''`M-c'''' (case-sensitivity) and '''`M-s i'''' (matching hidden text).


[:isearch-togg-case-fold]
* '''`M-c'''' (`isearch-toggle-case-fold') toggles case sensitivity.  If
option `isearchp-toggle-option-flag' is non-`nil' then it toggles
''option'' '''`isearchp-case-fold'''' to change the sensitivity ''from now
on''.  Otherwise, the option value is not changed, so the effect
is for the current search only.

[:isearch-toggle-invisible]
* '''`M-s i'''' (`isearch-toggle-invisible') toggles invisible-text
sensitivity.  If option `isearchp-toggle-option-flag' is non-`nil'
then it toggles ''option'' '''`search-invisible'''' to change the
sensitivity ''from now on''.  Otherwise, the option value is not
changed, so the effect is for the current search only.



[:isearchp-toggle-invisible']
* '''`##C-+##'''' ('''`isearchp-toggle-invisible'''') toggles the value of
''option'' '''`search-invisible''''.  The effect is like that of `M-s i'
with no prefix argument and with non-`nil'
`isearchp-toggle-option-flag'.

[:isearchp-toggle-set-region]
[:goto-longest-line]
* Other bindings during Isearch:
** '''`next'''', '''`prior'''' repeat the last Isearch forward and backward (easier than using the [[chord]]s `C-s', `C-r').
** '''`C-end'''' -- go to the longest line. Repeat to go to the longest line following that one in the buffer. As usual, `C-g' puts you back where you started. This binding is made only if you also use library <tt>[[misc-cmds.el]]</tt>. See [[FindLongLines#goto-longest-line|Find Long Lines]].
** '''`C-h'''' provides ''help'' on Isearch while searching. Library <tt>[[isearch+.el]]</tt> also redefines `isearch-mode-help' so that it lists ''all'' Isearch bindings and ends Isearch properly.

[:isearch-edit-string]
* '''`M-e'''' ('''`isearch-edit-string'''') automatically puts the [[cursor]] at the first mismatch position in the search string, for easy editing.  Whereas `C-g' (see also `M-k') removes all of the mismatch, this feature lets you change or insert a character or two, without losing the rest of the search string.

[:isearchp-initiate-edit-commands]
* A [[user option]], '''`isearchp-initiate-edit-commands'''', that specifies [[command]]s whose [[key]]s will not exit Isearch but will instead initiate editing of the search string.  For example, if `backward-char' is included in the list then `C-b' and `left' will just move the [[cursor]] backward over the search string so you can change, delete, or insert chars in the middle somewhere.  This makes the search string more [[minibuffer]]-like.


[:isearchp-mouse-2-flag]
* You can, by default, select text with the mouse, then hit `C-s'
etc. to search for it.  This is controlled by [[user option]] '''`isearchp-mouse-2-flag''''.







----

<tt>[[isearch-prop.el]]</tt> Features:


[:isearchp-property-forward]
[:isearchp-property-forward-regexp]
* You can search ''within character-property zones''.  Example: search within zones having a `face' text property with a value of `font-lock-comment-face' or `font-lock-string-face'.  Search [[overlay]]s or [[text property|text properties]]. From within Isearch: '''`C-t'''' (or '''`C-M-t'''' for [[regexp]] search).  First time, or with a [[prefix argument]], you are prompted for the property and its values.  See the doc string of command '''`isearchp-property-forward''''.

[:isearchp-put-prop-on-region]
* Besides relying on other code to set `face' and other text
properties for use with `C-t', you can use command
'''`isearchp-put-prop-on-region'''' (outside of Isearch) to add a text
property to a zone of text.  By default, it applies the last
property and value whose zones you searched using `C-t', but a
[[prefix argument]] lets you specify the property and value to apply.
This gives you an interactive way to set up zones for
text-property search (`C-t').  For property `face', empty input
removes all faces from the region.

[:hlt-highlight--isearch-matches]
[:hlt-unhighlight--isearch-matches]
* If you use library [[HighlightLibrary|Highlight]] (<tt>[[highlight.el]]</tt>) then you can highlight and
unhighlight Isearch matches in different faces, including for
multiple-buffer searches.  Library Highlight binds keys '''`M-s h h'''' and
'''`M-s h u'''' for this highlighting and unhighlighting.




[:isearchp-toggle-complementing-domain]
* You can search zones of text/overlays that have a given property, as described above, or you can search the ''complement'': the zones that do ''NOT'' have a given property.  You can toggle this search-domain complementing at any time during Isearch,
using '''`##C-M-~##'''' (command `isearchp-toggle-complementing-domain').

[:isearchp-dim-non-prop-zones-flag]
[:isearchp-dimming-color]
*  When you search propertied zones, the non-searchable zones are
''dimmed'', to make the searchable areas stand out.  [[option|Option]]
'''`isearchp-dim-non-prop-zones-flag'''' controls whether such dimming
occurs.  You can toggle it anytime during Isearch, using '''`C-M-D''''
(aka `C-M-S-d').  Option '''`isearchp-dimming-color'''' defines the
dimming behavior.  It specifies a given background color to use
always, or it specifies that the current background color is to
be dimmed a given amount.

[:isearchp-thing]
[:isearchp-thing-define-contexts]
* You can search the text of THINGS of various kind (sexps, lists,
defuns, lines, pages, sentences, filenames, strings, comments,
xml/html elements, symbols,...), using command '''`isearchp-thing''''.
This is equivalent to using command
'''`isearchp-thing-define-contexts'''', which marks such zones with a
text property, and then using `isearchp-property-forward'.

[:isearchp-next-visible-thing]
[:isearchp-previous-visible-thing]
* Not related to searching, but you can also move forward and
backward among things of a given kind, using the repeatable
commands '''`isearchp-next-visible-thing'''' and
'''`isearchp-previous-visible-thing''''.  For best results I 
recommend that you also use library <tt>[[thingatpt+.el]]</tt>.  It
enhances the vanilla treatment of THINGS and fixes various
vanilla thing-at-point bugs.


[:isearchp-imenu]
[:isearchp-imenu-command]
[:isearchp-imenu-macro]
[:isearchp-imenu-non-interactive-function]
* You can search the text of EmacsLisp definitions of different
kinds, using commands '''`isearchp-imenu'''',
'''`isearchp-imenu-command'''', '''`isearchp-imenu-macro'''', and
'''`isearchp-imenu-non-interactive-function''''.  Since ImenuMode is based
on regexps that recognize definitions, these commands are based
on the behavior of `isearchp-regexp-context-search'.

[:isearchp-remove-property]
[:isearchp-remove-all-properties]
* You can ''remove properties'' from text or overlays using commands
'''`isearchp-remove-property'''' and '''`isearchp-remove-all-properties''''.
By default, the latter removes only properties whose names begin
with `isearchp-'.  These are the properties inserted
automatically by the commands of library <tt>[[isearch-prop.el]]</tt>, when you do not
specify a property.

[:isearchp-toggle-hiding-comments]
[:isearchp-toggle-ignoring-comments]
* You can hide or show code comments during Isearch, using '''`##M-;##''''
(command '''`isearchp-toggle-hiding-comments'''').  You can toggle
ignoring comments during Isearch, using '''`##C-M-;##'''' (command
'''`isearchp-toggle-ignoring-comments'''').

'''See Also:'''

* '''ReplacePlus''' for related extensions to Emacs' standard `query-replace'. In particular, the ability to select (put the [[region]] around) the last replacement.
* '''ThingAtPointCommands''' for commands to extend the region around different things near [[point]]. You can use it to extend the search-target region.
* '''[[Icicles - Icompletion#HighlightNonmatch|Icicles Icompletion]]''' for similar highlighting of the non-matching portion of your input during [[completion]].

== Searching for unicode characters with IsearchPlus when IdoUbiquitous is enabled. ==

In Emacs 24.2.1, and maybe other versions, if you use IsearchPlus with Ido Ubiquitous (see: InteractivelyDoThings) enabled, you find that you can't search for unicode charaters and if you try an error is generated.  In Emacs 24.2.1 the solution is to disable Ido's advice around `completing-read' when `isearchp-read-unicode-char' is called.  This can be done by putting:

<code>
     (ido-ubiquitous-disable-in isearchp-read-unicode-char)
</code>

in your .emacs file.  When I first did this, I evaluated the form interactively and it didn't seem to fix the problem - I don't know why - but it worked next time I started up Emacs. --- [[Bernard Hurley]]

[new:DrewAdams:2012-12-13 16:22 UTC]
Good to know, for Ido users.  If you investigate a bit more and figure out why it sometimes does not work, would this be something that should be done automatically in '''Isearch+'''?  Or do you think some users would not want it done (in which case perhaps it should be an [[option]] or an Isearch toggle)?  Would you like to try patching ##isearch+.el## to DTRT?  Seems like we should be able to take care of this kind of thing automatically, so users do not need to do anything. -- DrewAdams

[new:[[Bernard Hurley]]]
Ido seems to work by advising `completing-read' and advising various functions that call it.  Ido code doesn't look very clear to me, but I think that's what it does.  It also turns off this advice for functions that the Ido developers know about but haven't got round to advising. This is obviously going to cause problems if you write a function that calls `completing-read', as yours does, and are returned an unexpected value.  I can't imagine any users not wanting this fixed automatically.  My own thoughts are that since Ido makes this quite radical change to a core Emacs function, it's better if it's done automatically in that package.  I have emailed the developers to gently suggest this.  However I will look farther into it in case they don't want to do so.  -- [[Bernard Hurley]]


[new:DrewAdams:2012-12-14 01:31 UTC]
Thanks for the update.  FYI, I renamed `isearchp-read-unicode-char' to `isearchp-insert-char-by-name' in keeping with an updated definition and an expectation that Emacs 24.4 might include this (as `isearch-insert-char-by-name').

[new:DrewAdams:2013-06-27 21:47 UTC]
:: Now that it is included in vanilla GnuEmacs 24.4, it is named `isearch-char-by-name'. -- DrewAdams
[new]

I still have the same question as above:

: [W]ould this be something that should be done automatically in '''Isearch+'''?  Or do you think some users would not want it done (in which case perhaps it should be an [[option]] or an Isearch toggle)?

Please let me know, when you can.  It would be good to take care of this problem automatically, if that is appropriate.  Thx -- DrewAdams

[new:[[Bernard Hurley]]:2012-12-16 11:27 UTC]

Since searching for unicode characters in isearch+ is virtually impossible
without the fix, I think it should be done automatically.  Ido users might be a
bit surprised not to get an Ido search at this point but Ido isn't guaranteed to
work everywhere, so I can't see why anyone shouldn't want the fix.  -- [[Bernard Hurley]]


[new:DrewAdams:2012-12-16 15:56 UTC]
OK, thanks.  Can you provide a patch?  Note that the same feature might well be added to Emacs --- see this thread:
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2012-12/msg00234.html.  So you might want to bring JuriLinkov into the loop about fixing this wrt Ido.  He might also have a suggestion.  Please cc me if you do so by email.  Thx -- DrewAdams
