Footswitches (pedals), such as those designed by XKeys (http://www.xkeys.com/xkeys/xkfoot.php) and sold under various badges, can offload some work from the hands, which may be helpful if you have RepeatedStrainInjury. They are excellent for [[modifier key]]s (Ctrl, Alt, Shift) but are also more widely useful than that (EmacsVersor is designed partly for elegant footswitch use).
