Footswitches (pedals), such as those designed by XKeys (http://www.xkeys.com/xkeys/xkfoot.php) and sold under various badges, can offload some work from the hands, which may be helpful if you have RepeatedStrainInjury. They are excellent for [[modifier key]]s (Ctrl, Alt, Shift) but are also more widely useful than that (EmacsVersor is designed partly for elegant footswitch use).

Update, 2011-05-31: I've been struggling to set up the USB version of the XKeys pedals in an all-Linux environment, having previously always used the PS2 version.  XKeys provide a Windows-only program for setting the keycodes, and when I asked about getting the information necessary for programming the pedals from Linux, they said they don't release that information.  So in an all-Linux environment, I now recommend making your own: cannibalize a cheap keyboard for its controller, and add switches and your own mechanical hardware.  (It'll be a lot cheaper too.)
