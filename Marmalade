[http://marmalade-repo.org/ Marmalade] is an [[ELPA]] compatible
package repository that allows users to upload their own packages.
Package maintainers don't have to be the same as the maintainers of
the original code.

Some packages (for instance, slime) are out of date however.

The repository has had availability problems and is now managed by
NicFerrier who says he is slowly fixing things.

Unlike MELPA, use of marmalade-repo *is* restricted to only free
software packages. But unlike ELPA marmalade-repo requires no signing
of Copyright papers.
