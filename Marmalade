[http://marmalade-repo.org/ Marmalade] is an [[ELPA]] compatible package repository that allows users to upload their own packages.  Package maintainers don't have to be the same as the maintainers of the original code.  

Some packages (for instance, slime) are out of date however.

Marmalade is for packages that cannot be uploaded to GNU's official ELPA repository.

Marmalade is a NodeJs project maintained by NicFerrier in [[http://github.com/nicferrier/marmalade|github]].
He asks that you report issues or suggest features through the [[https://github.com/nicferrier/marmalade/issues|Github issues system]].

NicFerrier is currently rewriting Marmalade in EmacsLisp using [[Elnode]].
