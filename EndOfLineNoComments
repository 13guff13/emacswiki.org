13:07 <impaktor> Is there a command/key like C-e but ignore
      comments? Like "(lisp-code-here)      ;;comment"

There is not, but here's how you could write one yourself:

{{{
(defun impaktor-move-end-of-line ()
  (interactive)
  (skip-syntax-forward "^<" (line-end-position))
  (skip-syntax-backward " " (line-beginning-position)))
}}}

How does it work?

##(skip-syntax-forward "^<" (line-end-position))## will skip forward up to the end of the line, stopping at a comment start character.

##(skip-syntax-backward " " (line-beginning-position))## will skip backward over trailing whitespace.

To install, copy it into your InitFile and add something like the following to your init file:

{{{
(add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode (lambda () (local-set-key (kbd "C-c C-e") 'impaktor-move-end-of-line))
}}}

Didn't know that about skip-syntax for comments.  Must be GIT:newcomment.el existed before it was introduced. -- AaronHawley
