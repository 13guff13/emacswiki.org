There are a lot of people who are living with Emacs around the world. 
Sometimes, it is very fun to see how they use Emacs and even very helpful to learn from it.
A screencast is a kind of video screen capture with or without sound. 
Screencasts can show how people actually work with Emacs.
You can pick up valuable usage patterns, just by looking over someones shoulder.
