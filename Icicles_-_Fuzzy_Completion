== Fuzzy Completion ==

There are a few kinds of what might be called "fuzzy" matching used in
'''Icicles''' [[completion]], in addition to [[apropos completion|apropos]] ([[regexp]]) matching and [[prefix completion|prefix]]
matching.

* '''Fuzzy''' -- This method uses a fairly sophisticated matching algorithm that seems to
account for various typing mistakes.  This algorithm is provided
by library <tt>[[fuzzy-match.el]]</tt>, so I call its use in '''Icicles''' "'''[::fuzzy completion]'''".  You must have library ##fuzzy-match.el## to use this.

* '''Scatter''' -- This is a simple, poor man's fuzzy matching that I call
"'''[::scatter matching]'''".  [[Ido]] calls it "flex" matching.  The
TextMate editor has the same thing for file-name
matching (only), without naming it.

* '''Levenshtein''' -- This method checks whether two strings differ by
at most a given number of character operations, the so-called
[[LevenshteinDistance|Levenshtein distance]].

You can use fuzzy completion in place of prefix completion (`TAB').
You can use the scatter or Levenshtein completion in place of apropos completion
(`S-TAB').  You can change completion methods easily at any time,
by hitting a key in the [[minibuffer]]:

* '''`##C-(##'''' (command `icicle-next-TAB-completion-method') to cycle among `TAB' completion methods: `basic',
`vanilla', and `fuzzy' (`vanilla' only for Emacs 23 and later;
`fuzzy' only if you use library <tt>[[fuzzy-match.el]]</tt>).

* '''`##M-(##'''' (command `icicle-next-S-TAB-completion-method') to cycle `S-TAB' completion methods: `apropos', `scatter',
`Levenshtein' and `##Levenshtein strict##'.

Of these methods, prefix completion and apropos completion are by
far the most useful, followed, in order, by scatter, fuzzy, and Levenshtein completion.

Besides these methods, remember that you can get ordinary
substring matching with `S-TAB' by using '''`##C-`##'''' to turn off
(toggle) escaping of regexp special characters.  With special
characters escaped, `S-TAB' does literal substring completion.

The type of completion matching that is used when you hit `S-TAB'
and `TAB' is controlled by [[user option]]s 
'''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-S-TAB-completion-methods-alist|icicle-S-TAB-completion-methods-alist]]</tt>'''' and '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-TAB-completion-methods|icicle-TAB-completion-methods]]</tt>'''', respectively.  By default, the first method in each list is used for matching.

You can use `##M-(##' and `##C-(##' in the minibuffer to cycle among the
`S-TAB' and `TAB' completion methods, respectively.






[:PartialCompletion]
=== Partial Completion ===

This section pertains to Emacs releases starting with Emacs 23.

If option `<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-TAB-completion-methods|icicle-TAB-completion-methods]]</tt>' includes `vanilla'
(which it does, by default), and you choose `vanilla' completion
for `TAB' (by cycling using `##C-(##' or by customizing
`icicle-TAB-completion-methods' to use `vanilla' as the default),
then '''Icicles''' `TAB' completion respects the standard Emacs option
`completion-styles', so the behavior of `TAB' is similar to what
it is in vanilla Emacs.

Emacs includes `partial-completion' in the default value of
`completion-styles'.  This means that '''Icicles''' too will make
use of partial completion when you use `TAB' (with `vanilla').  '''Icicles''' makes no
use of `completion-styles' when you use `S-TAB'.

Partial completion is not really a kind of fuzzy completion, but
its effect can sometimes be similar.  In some ways, it is similar
to [[#ScatterMatchCompletion|scatter-match]] completion, but it requires you to
explicitly mark where to skip ahead (using `##*##', `## ##' (space), or `##-##').

'''Icicles''' does not support using the mode `partial-completion-mode',
and Emacs itself is in the process of deprecating it, now that the
partial-completion style is active by default.

I do not necessarily recommend using `vanilla' for `TAB'
completion, or, if you do, including `partial-completion' as
an entry in `completion-styles', because its effect is often
counter-intuitive or confusing.  But it is included by default in
Emacs, and '''Icicles''' supports it.  You might find it useful in
file-name completion, to be able to complete directory components,
for instance.

Note: The same Emacs mechanism allows for completion of
environment variables during file-name completion, and this too is
inhibited if you set `icicle-prefix-completion-is-basic-flag' to
`nil'.



[:ScatterMatchCompletion]
=== Scatter-Match Completion ===

The idea behind scatter-match completion is very simple: input
characters are matched in order against completion candidates, but
possibly with intervening characters.  That is, your input
scatter-matches a completion candidate if each character is also
in the candidate, and the character order is respected.

What this really amounts to is matching input `abc' as if it were
the regexp `##a.*b.*c##'.  That's all.

You can use '''Icicles''' scatter matching at any time in place of
apropos (regexp) matching.  Unlike the case of fuzzy completion
(see below), you can use it to complete file names also.






[:FuzzyMatchCompletion]
=== Fuzzy-Match Completion ===

[:icicle-next-TAB-completion-method]
[:icicle-TAB-completion-methods]
Fuzzy completion takes more explaining.  If you use library <tt>[[fuzzy-match.el]]</tt>, then you can use fuzzy input
matching during '''Icicles''' `TAB' completion.
'''Icicles''' fuzzy completion is controlled by option
'''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-TAB-completion-methods|icicle-TAB-completion-methods]]</tt>'''', which you can cycle at any time
from the minibuffer using '''`##C-(##'''' (command `icicle-next-TAB-completion-method').  When fuzzy completion is turned on, `TAB' fuzzy-completes your input.

Fuzzy matching is described in detail in the commentary of library
<tt>[[fuzzy-match.el]]</tt>; please refer to that documentation.  Here are
some things to keep in mind when you use '''Icicles''' fuzzy completion:

* File-name completion is never fuzzy.
* Fuzzy completion is always case-sensitive.  This means that
  `C-A' in the minibuffer has no effect on fuzzy completion.
* Fuzzy completion always takes a space prefix in your input into
  account.  This means that `##M-_##' in the minibuffer has no effect on fuzzy completion.
* Fuzzy completion candidates are always sorted by decreasing
  match strength.  This means that you cannot use `##C-,##' in the
  minibuffer to sort candidates differently.

Fuzzy completion is a form of prefix completion in which some input
characters might not be present in a matched candidate.  Matching finds the
candidates that have the ''most'' characters in common with your
input, in the ''same order'' and with a ''minimum of non-matching'' characters. It can skip over non-matching characters, as long as the number of characters skipped in the candidate is less that those following them that match.  After the matching candidates are found, they are sorted by skip length and then candidate length.

Here are some examples:

||'''Input'''||'''Completion Domain'''||'''Matches (Candidates)'''||
||##abc##||{##xxabcxx##, ##xabcxxx##, ##xabx##}||{##xabcxxx##, ##xxabcxx##}||
||##point-mx##||Emacs [[variable]]s||{##point-max##, ##point-max-marker##}||
||##begining-of-l##||Emacs [[command]]s||{##beginning-of-line##, ##beginning-of-line-text##, ##move-beginning-of-line##, ##widget-beginning-of-line##}||

The last example shows that although fuzzy matching is a kind of
prefix matching, your input is not necessarily a prefix of each
matching candidate.  It is ''prefix'' matching because it tries to match your input starting at its beginning.  This input prefix is matched against candidate substrings, not necessarily candidate prefixes, but the non-matching part (if any) preceding the matched substring must not be longer than the matching part.  That is, non-matching substrings can be skipped over, but they must be no longer than the matching substrings that follow them.  If an input prefix does not match under these conditions, it is skipped over.

After matching an input prefix this way, the same process is repeated, recursively, for input text following that prefix and for match
positions following the matches found.  That is, after each such prefix match, the process starts again where it left off in both the input and the candidates.  The resulting matches contain one or more substrings of your input that are each at least as long as the non-matching parts that immediately precede them.  Only matches with the highest number of matching characters are retained.  They are sorted by two criteria: (1) nearness of matches to the start of the candidate and (2) candidate length.

The fuzzy-match algorithm is detailed in library <tt>[[fuzzy-match.el]]</tt>.
However, it is easier to get a feel for what it does by trying it
than by reading any description.  Just give it a try.  Do not
expect it to rival apropos completion in power or expressivity,
however.  Instead, think of it as prefix completion for lazy or
inaccurate typists!  If that sounds like you, then you might find
it useful. ;-)

Here are a couple of screenshots of [[buffer]] `*Completions*'.  The first shows command-name matches for the input '''`fo''''.  The second shows command-name matches for the input '''`fol''''.

==== Command-Name Input `fo' ====
[[image:drew-emacs-fuzzy-fo]]

==== Command-Name Input `fol' ====
[[image:drew-emacs-fuzzy-fol]]

The first thing to notice is the distribution of candidates for input `fo'. Candidates are in decreasing order of match fit:

* The nearer the match to the start of the candidate, the better the fit.
* The greater the ratio of matched text to unmatched text, the better the fit.

Note too the candidate `ifconfig'. First, note that it has no strict match for substring `fo'. Its match is in fact in two parts: `f', then `o'. Second, note that it is considered a better fuzzy match than the candidate `info'. This is because its match (`f') is nearer to the start of the candidate (second character, versus third).

The second thing to notice is that when you type the third input character, `l', the candidates are not a subset of the original set that matches `fo'. The candidates in the second screenshot all match `fol' in a fuzzy way, even though one of them, `mh-folder-mode', does not match `fo' sufficiently well to be included as a candidate.  Why?  Because in the `fo' case, the match is only two characters long and it starts after three non-matching characters.

For both screenshots: If all input prefixes are fair game for matching, why doesn't `*Completions*' also include other command names that match only the prefix `f' and nothing else?  Because there is at least one match that matches more than that -- ''only the best matches are retained''.  In this case, the best matches for input `fo' match both the `f' and the `o', and the best matches for input `fol' match all three of those characters.

Refer to <tt>[[fuzzy-match.el]]</tt> for a precise description of fuzzy matching.  It refers to "''matchiness''" for how many characters match and "''closeness''" for the ratio of number of characters matched to candidate length.

Note: It is not practical to try to highlight the exact candidate portions that match different parts of your input.  Because fuzzy-match input does not function as a literal string for matching purposes, it is more akin to substring matching than to plain prefix matching.  For this reason, regexp-match highlighting is used for fuzzy matching.  That is why you see the input `fo' highlighted in `*Completions*' candidates in other than just the prefix position.  It is also why the matching `f' and `o' in candidate `ifconfig' are not highlighted: for highlighting purposes, your input is treated as a regexp.

One takeaway here is that fuzzy completion is complicated. Rather than try to understand how it works and think ahead in those terms, you just need to get a feel for it -- learn by doing. Have fun!




[:icicle-levenshtein-distance]
[:LevenshteinMatchCompletion]
=== Levenshtein-Match Completion ===

The "[[LevenshteinDistance|Levenshtein distance]]" is the maximum number of character
insertions, deletions, or replacements that are needed to
transform one string to another.  The more similar two strings
are, the smaller their Levenshtein distance.

When this kind of completion is used, '''Icicles''' considers your input
to match a completion candidate if their Levenshtein distance is
no greater than the value of option '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-levenshtein-distance|icicle-levenshtein-distance]]</tt>''''.  The default value of the option is 1, meaning that the difference
is at most one character operation.

Using a strict definition of the distance, this also requires the
''length'' of your input to be within the Levenshtein distance of the
length of a completion candidate, for it to match.  That is quite
restrictive.  It is more flexible to consider your input to match a candidate if
it is within `icicle-levenshtein-distance' of some ''substring'' of
the candidate.  Because candidate substrings are tested, the
length of your input need not be nearly the same as the candidate
length.  

When you cycle among `S-TAB' completion methods using '''`##M-(##'''', there
are thus two choices for Levenshtein completion: `Levenshtein' and
`##Levenshtein strict##'.  The former is generally more useful.

The larger the value of `icicle-levenshtein-distance', the slower
Levenshtein completion becomes, since it must test more
possibilities.  Also, when the value is 1 (except for `##Levenshtein
strict##'), '''Icicles''' uses a fast, special-case algorithm, and it
highlights the matching parts of candidates in buffer
`*Completions*'.  1 is the most useful value.

If the value is other than 1 (or if it is 1 with `##Levenshtein strict##'), then you must also use library <tt>[[levenshtein.el]]</tt>, and
Levenshtein completion can be quite slow.  In that case, you will
no doubt want to turn off incremental completion (`##C-###').
