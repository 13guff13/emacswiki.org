A '''[::tags file]''' is an index to source-code definitions of functions, variables, and any other
interesting syntactic feature.  If you BuildTags for your
project (possibly RecursiveTags), Emacs can use the tags file (typically named "TAGS") to find the indexed definitions very quickly.
You need the EmacsTags (etags) program to generate the tags file.  The
program understands many languages, Lisps, C, C++ and Perl for
example.

The following Unix command creates a tags
file that indexes all of the EmacsLisp files in the current directory:

    rm -f TAGS
    etags *.el

This command creates a tags file for all ##*.c## and ##*.h## files
in the current directory and its subdirectories (recursively):

    rm -f TAGS
    find . -name "*.[ch]" -print | xargs etags -a

You might want to add the target tags to their Makefile, so
that they can easily be updated.

The following will create a tags file if none exists. Just hit `##M-.##' and you're off.

 (defadvice find-tag (before c-tag-file activate)
   "Automatically create tags file."
   (let ((tag-file (concat default-directory "TAGS")))
     (unless (file-exists-p tag-file)
       (shell-command "etags *.[ch] -o TAGS 2>/dev/null"))
     (visit-tags-table tag-file)))

After this, `M-x visit-tags-table RET' and `M-x tags-search RET' are your
friends.  Also take a look at

##sure-tags.el## works pretty well, but I've noticed that it doesn't work 
properly with those filesystems in which space characters are allowed 
in files/folders names. This is a patch that makes it work:

There are two different programs, ##ctags## and ##etags##. Both are distributed with Emacs, XEmacs, and on their own, so you
might run into conflicts if you have several editors installed.  Vi
uses ##ctags##(1) that creates files names ##tags##.  There is also
ExuberantCtags. In all these cases, be sure to generate Emacs-compatible output. See also GnuGlobal.
