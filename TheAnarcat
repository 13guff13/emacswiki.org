I am a long time Xemacs user that just switched to emacs for the SVN support (throw rocks elsewhere).

I've played quite a bit with both of those to make them behave as a regular "file manager" user would expect: double-click on a file and it opens in a new window. Close the file closes the window. Sound simple? Quite hackish in emacs. See EmacsClient.

People can look for me on a few other wikis, mostly http://orangeseeds.net/wiki/ and http://koumbit.net/wiki/

People looking for free software reviews might want to look (and participate!) in my http://orangeseeds.net/wiki/FreeExperiments and 
http://orangeseeds.net/wiki/OrangeSoftware.

I like this wiki very much.
