Go to next CHAR which is similar to "f" in vim.

Wan Ying have posted a function `wy-go-to-char' long time
ago. According to his post, that function is implmented with the help
from OliverScholz. Lisp:iy-go-to-char.el is an enhancement, with more
keybindings while navigating the characters. See the detailed
documents embeded in the file.
