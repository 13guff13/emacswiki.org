I am [http://samueltonini.com/ samueltonini], a software developer and dance teacher.

These days I have been coding heavily with Elixir, Emacs Lisp, Ruby and JavaScript.

Since a [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/senny friend] introduced me to Emacs, I use Emacs every day all the time for everything.

== My Emacs configuration ==
My Emacs setup is based on [[cabbage]]

[[cabbage]] fundamental organization are bundles. You can enable and disable the configuration on a per bundle basis.

Have a look at my [https://github.com/tonini/emacs.d config] and see how you could setup everything properly through bundles.
