initsplit.el splits out certain customization variables (defined via a regexp)
into their own files.  I use it to split out my JDE settings; the
remainder of my customizations work across my three machines, but the
JDE stuff is highly machine-specific.  Oh, and as a by-product,
customization variables are sorted in alphabetical order.

Get it from here:

One small annoyance I found with this otherwise excellent package is that it clobbers the KillRing quite drastically.  The following piece of advice fixes that.

<pre>
 (defadvice initsplit-split-customizations (around do-the-initsplit act)
   "Don't clobber the `kill-ring' when writing customizations."
   (let ((orig-kill-ring kill-ring))
     (unwind-protect
	 ad-do-it
       (setq kill-ring orig-kill-ring))))
</pre>

From the DotEmacsChallenge page:

Fed up of bunging all of your config into one file? Try something like this.

  ;; default xemacs configuration directory
  (defconst toc:xemacs-config-dir "~/.xemacs/xemacs_configs/" "")

  ;; utility finction to auto-load my package configurations
  (defun toc:load-config-file (filelist)
    (dolist (file filelist)
      (load (expand-file-name 
             (concat toc:xemacs-config-dir file)))
       (message "Loaded config file:%s" file)
       ))

  ;; load my configuration files
  (toc:load-config-file '("mswindows_config"
                          "frames_config"
                          "info_config"
                          "desktop_config"
                          "efs_config"
                          "backup_config"
                          "modemaps_config"
                         ))

This loads the files mswindows_config.el, frames_config.elâ€¦ etc from the directory toc:xemacs-config-dir. I find it helps me to split my (X)Emacs config into managble chunks. The toc: symbol prefix (my initials) is just to make sure it does not clash with anything else.

See DotEmacsModular for a similar approach.
