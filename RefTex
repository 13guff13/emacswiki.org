Here is some information from the homepage, http://staff.science.uva.nl/~dominik/Tools/reftex/.

RefTeX provides distinct support for doing labels, references and citations in LaTeX. It works with both Emacs and XEmacs and runs as a minor mode with any of the LaTeX major modes around, most notably AUCTeX.

RefTeX is bundled and preinstalled with Emacs since version 20.2.
It was also bundled with XEmacs 19.16--20.x.
XEmacs 21.x users want to install the corresponding plugin package which is available from the XEmacs ftp site.
See the XEmacs 21.x documentation on package installation for details.

'''Hooking into AUCTeX''

Don't forget to put something in your .emacs to make RefTeX work properly with AUCTeX:

   (setq reftex-plug-into-AUCTeX t)

'''Custom Sections and Labels'''

One nice feature of RefTeX is the ability to create custom labels in addition to those it recognizes from packages. These become available for shortcuts and navigation in the TOC feature (one of the best features of the mode). Here is an example creating a "Poem" label that also shows up as a level 3 entry in the TOC:

    (add-hook 'reftex-load-hook
      (lambda ()
        (setq reftex-section-levels
            (cons '("poemtitle" . -3) reftex-section-levels))))
    
    (setq reftex-label-alist
	    '(("\\poemtitle" ?P "poem:" "\\ref{%s}" nil ("poem" "poemtitle"))))
