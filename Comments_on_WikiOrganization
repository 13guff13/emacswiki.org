    The reason this is not all automated is because a) it would require the maintenance of a separate link database, and b) in a double linked graph there may be potentially a lot of irrelevant pages pointing to the current page, so you do not always want to list them. Thus, the manual strategy of adding category tags or parent pages at the end.

That's only true if a category tag is the same thing as a link (as is now); this is a wiki; while we ''can'' use a file to saw and a saw to file, there is no excuse to go into a forest armed only with a file.

What exactly are you proposing? On a different site, I'm using tags with a typed link: ##[[tag:Something]]## together with a simple database to keep track of them. I'm mostly concerned about category pages:

# do we want to keep them?
# if we want to keep them, will we still maintain them by hand?
# if we maintain them by hand, what's the benefit of using ##[[tag:Something]]## as opposed to ##CategorySomething##?

Or are you arguing that we don't need a bottom-up categorization of pages, we can do a top-down categorization. If a category page links to a page, that page automatically belongs to that category and can link back to the category without being modified? If so, I guess we could define a set of /entry/ pages (such as the SiteMap) which links to /category/ pages (as it does), and the category pages would still be maintained by hand, but it is no longer necessary to mention the categories on the page itself.
