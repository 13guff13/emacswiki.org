How long should resolved issues stay on the main page? Always? For a while? Move it to "EmacsWikiProblemsSolved" or to this Comments/Talk page?

My preference would be to delete them once they are resolved.
I don't think we need to archive them.
I try to delete stuff that's obviously resolved or no longer applicable, but I find it difficult to delete things I'm unsure of. It feels disrespectful to delete stuff because I don't understand or can't reproduce the problem.

I agree -- resolved problems can just be deleted.

The highlight of Project Cloud for me is the structured, yet oh-so-easy, Submittal and RFI review process.If you attend this webinar, you will see how the role-based process eliminates any questions about where Submittal packages and RFIs are in the review cycle.  It&#39;s completely transparent to all team members!I also really like the markup tools.  I can view everyone else&#39;s notations in real time, but feel secure that my markups cannot be changed by anyone else.I&#39;m so excited to debut Newforma Project Cloud, and can&#39;t wait to hear the feedback particularly from the construction industry!Susan McDowellDirector of Construction Solutions
