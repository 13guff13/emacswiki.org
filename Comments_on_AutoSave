Reading the Auto-Saving section of the emacs manual I tried this method and it apparently works (I tested it just a little now):

    (setq auto-save-visited-file-name 1)
    (setq auto-save-interval 10)
    (setq auto-save-timeout 10)

In the section "Running save-buffer automatically", user BryanMurdock describes a problem with auto-save-visited-file-name in which the buffer is considered out of date and displays a warning.  Like joseghast above I just turned on auto-save-visited-file-name and it seems to work as I expect it to, with no warnings about the buffer being out of date.

Do not use
find -name "#*#" | xargs rm
or any other variation.
Use:
find -name "#*#" -delete

Is it possible to keep the auto-save functionality while not getting an auto-save file after confirming that a buffer with unsaved changes should not be saved on exiting emacs?
