Coverage of finder-by-keyword keywords in CategoryCategories is already fairly strong.  Only 13/36 keywords are entirely missing by my count:

These 12 keywords have exact matches in Category-space by name, and reasonable overlap in content:

* calendar
* data
* extensions
* faces
* files
* frames
* games
* help
* hypermedia
* mail
* mouse
* tex        

These 8 keywords have matches in Category-space under different spellings.  In many cases the EmacsWiki name is superior for both humans and search engines.  Though it would not hurt to have redirect pages:

* CategoryEmulation / emulations
* CategoryInternationalization / i18n
* CategoryModes / languages
* CategoryOutline / outlines
* CategoryProgrammerUtils / tools
* CategorySearchAndReplace / matching
* CategoryVersionControl / vc
* CategoryWriting / wp

1 keyword already has a redirect to matching content:

* CategoryCode / lisp  (CategoryLisp redirects to CategoryCode)

1 keyword matches a page which could become a category (could be other hits like this one)

* MultimediaModes / multimedia

1 keyword is not meaningful in the context of a public Wiki

* local

13 remaining finder-by-keyword terms have no match in Category-space.  Some omissions are surprising -- no CategoryC or CategoryUnix:

* abbrev        -- abbreviation handling, typing shortcuts, and macros
* bib           -- bibliography processors
* c             -- C and related programming languages
* comm          -- communications, networking, and remote file access
* convenience   -- convenience features for faster editing
* docs          -- Emacs documentation facilities
* hardware      -- interfacing with system hardware
* internal      -- code for Emacs internals, build process, defaults
* maint         -- Emacs development tools and aids
* news          -- USENET news reading and posting
* processes     -- processes, subshells, and compilation
* terminals     -- text terminals (ttys)
* unix          -- UNIX feature interfaces and emulators
