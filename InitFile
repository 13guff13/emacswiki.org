Your '''[::init file]''' contains personal EmacsLisp code that you want to execute when you start Emacs.

* For GnuEmacs, it is ##~/.emacs## or ##_emacs## or ##~/.emacs.d/init.el##.
* For [[XEmacs]], it is ##~/.xemacs## or ##~/.xemacs/init.el##.
* For AquamacsEmacs, it is ##~/.emacs## or ##~/Library/Preferences/Aquamacs Emacs/Preferences.el##

In [[Emacs]], if you do not know where your init file is located or you do not have one and want to create it, then
just open it for editing in Emacs:

   C-x C-f ~/.emacs RET

When you add Lisp to your init file, it is not evaluated until you restart Emacs.  Rather than restarting Emacs, you can use `M-x eval-buffer', or `M-x eval-region' or just `C-x C-e'.  See EvaluatingExpressions.

If it seems your InitFile is not being read, type `C-h e' to see if there's a chance there was a problem with it loading.  See also DebugFileLoading.

It's often better to break up a lengthy init file into a number of EmacsLisp libraries and a small, top-level init file that loads those libraries, especially if you define commands and other functions. Some of the init files posted on %%EmacsWiki%% are organized in this way, as a set of library files.

For info about how to load an EmacsLisp file automatically when you start Emacs, see InstallingPackages.

You can also have a separate CustomFile reserved strictly for customizations recorded by [[Customize]].

Start Emacs with a specific init file:

   emacs -q -l ~/my-init-file.el

For more information about init files and custom files (Emacs 22 or later):

: ##C-h r i init-file RET## or ##M-: (info "(emacs) Init File")## 
: ##M-: (info "(emacs) Saving Customizations")##
: ##M-: (info "(elisp) Init File")##
