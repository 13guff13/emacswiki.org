This module is disabled by default.  To enable it use M-x customize-variable RET erc-modules.

Using this module will keep the prompt line at the bottom of the window.
The latest text is also at the bottom of the screen, so it's easier to catch up after turning back to the screen.

: <b>Bug:</b> If you use Carbon Emacs 21.3.50.1 or thereabouts, using this module will probably make Emacs freeze and suck up 100% CPU time, requiring you to force quit Emacs. -- JerameyCrawford


:: This is actually a bug in Emacs redisplay code, rather than in ERC.  A fix for it is to set 
:: <code>erc-input-line-position</code> to a value other than <code>nil</code> or <code>-1</code>.
:: E.g. do:


    (setq erc-input-line-position -2)

:: In your ERC customisations.  See the docstring of that variable for more information.
