In my .emacs I have the follow setting:

(define-key evil-motion-state-map "\C-u" 'scroll-up-command)
This works well.

But what if I wanted to change it to spacebar or Return key?

(define-key evil-motion-state-map "<return>" 'scroll-up-command)
(define-key evil-motion-state-map "SPC" 'scroll-up-command)
Nothing spectular will happen, the return/Enter key and spacebar are behaving their standard behaviour. I looked around for the right keys, and it seems they're the rights keys. For example,

(global-set-key (kbd "<return>") 'save-buffer) 
Works fine.

What am I doing wrong in Emacs/Evil with the Enter key?

ReneFroger, This works :
(define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "RET") 'scroll-up)
Though I don't know much about lisp or programming for that matter. Copy pasted and changed from some existing lines in .emacs
