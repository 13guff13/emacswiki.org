== Overview ==

The "Tiny Tools" is JariAalto's large collection of
small emacs customizations implemented as one
monolithic package:

* http://freshmeat.net/projects/emacs-tiny-tools (The project HUB; never changes)
* http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/emacs-tiny-tools (devel site main)
* http://www.nongnu.org/emacs-tiny-tools (devel site homepage)

== Download and Install ==

=== From version control repository (latest code) ===

The latest code can be found from Git version control. Run these commands:

  mkdir -p ~/emacs.d/packages
  cd ~/emacs.d/packages

  git clone git://git.savannah.nongnu.org/emacs-tiny-tools.git
  git checkout --track -b devel origin/devel

  #   from time to time, upgrade to latest
  git pull

To install, add this to your <code>~/.emacs</code> InitFile:

  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/emacs.d/packages/emacs-tiny-tools/lisp/tiny")
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/emacs.d/packages/emacs-tiny-tools/lisp/other")

=== From Savannah snapshot tarball ===

The Savannah contains a link to snapshot tarball, if you prefer it over the Git:

  #   or if you prefer traditional: ~/elisp

  INSTALL=$HOME/.emacs.d
  mkdir $INSTALL

  #   cd to directory where you unpacked the tarball
  install -m 644 lisp/tiny/*.el lisp/other/*.el $INSTALL/

Add following to your Emacs InitFile:

 (add-to-list 'load-path "~/emacs.d")

 ;; Optional
 ;; (require 'tinypath)

== Other ==

=== Documents ===

Also on the Tiny Tools site, there are a number of documents
written by Jari Aalto about emacs programming issues in general.
While not perfect, and not always up-to-date, these are
often informative, interesting reading for the
beginning-to-intermediate Emacs Lisp programmer:

* http://www.nongnu.org/emacs-tiny-tools/resources/
* http://www.nongnu.org/emacs-tiny-tools/keybindings/
* http://www.nongnu.org/emacs-tiny-tools/font/
* http://www.nongnu.org/emacs-tiny-tools/packages/

== Discussion ==

[new]

Jari Alto put together many useful ideas. Many still benefit from
them. The TinyTools tips here probably do most of the
polishing/correcting needed TinyTools has been useful to this newbie
for many years. I have not even figured it all out, or read all the
docs.
