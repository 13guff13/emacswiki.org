== Overview ==

The "Tiny Tools" is JariAalto's large collection of 
small emacs customizations implemented as one 
monolithic package:

* http://freshmeat.net/projects/emacs-tiny-tools (The project HUB; never changes)
* http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/emacs-tiny-tools (devel site main)
* http://www.nongnu.org/emacs-tiny-tools (devel site homepage)

  #   from time to time, upgrade to latest
  git pull

To install, add this to your <code>~/.emacs</code> InitFile:

  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/emacs.d/packages/emacs-tiny-tools/lisp/tiny")
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/emacs.d/packages/emacs-tiny-tools/lisp/other")

Jari Alto put together many useful ideas. Many still benefit from them. The TinyTools tips here probably do most of the polishing/correcting needed
TinyTools has been useful to this newbie for many years. I have not even figured it all out, or read all the docs.

=== Installation from tarball ===

Here's a quick synopsis of one way of doing it (tested on GNU/Linux, with Gnu Emacs 21),
in case you downloaded the snapshot tarball:

  #   or if you prefer traditional: ~/elisp

  install=$HOME/.emacs.d
  mkdir $install

  #   cd to directory where you unpacked the tarball
  install -m 644 lisp/tiny/*.el lisp/other/*.el $install/

And in your Emacs InitFile (in case you used another directory):

 (pushnew "~/.emacs.d/" load-path)
 
 ;; Optional
 ;; (require 'tinypath)

=== Documents ===

Also on the Tiny Tools site, there are a number of documents 
written by Jari Aalto about emacs programming issues in general. 
While not perfect, and not always up-to-date, these are
often informative, interesting reading for the 
beginning-to-intermediate Emacs Lisp programmer:

* http://www.nongnu.org/emacs-tiny-tools/keybindings/
* http://www.nongnu.org/emacs-tiny-tools/font/
* http://www.nongnu.org/emacs-tiny-tools/packages/
