EhudKarni wrote a package to allow the input of Hebrew, including right-to-left input (SupportBiDi).

You can get the hebeng.el file at http://www.t-e-k.biz/els/

Or, if you have only email access:

* Send mail to mailto:auto_mail@unix.mvs.co.il
* Use "files" as the subject (one word, no quotes)
* Put "hebeng.el.gz" on the first line (one word, no quotes)

The mail will be sent to your reply address.

For Windows, you need non-inverted Hebrew fonts.
Here is how to get them (sorry, I can't put them at the above site):

* Send mail to mailto:auto_mail@unix.mvs.co.il
* Use "files" as the subject (one word, no quotes)
* Put "wehm.ttf.gz" on the first line (one word, no quotes)
