: when i read my old code, i find it pleasant when it is either scheme or
elisp, sort of so-so w/ sh and C, out of sorts w/ perl and python, and
wretched and tormented w/ C++.  ymmv of course.

Guile, a dialect of [[Scheme]], is the native language of the GNU standard extension language interpreter (http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/).

The GuileEmacs project is to replace EmacsLisp with Guile.

See GuileIde for editing Guile code in Emacs and using Emacs to interact with inferior Guile interpreter processes.
