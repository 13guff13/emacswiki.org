== Buffer-Name Input ==

The '''Icicles''' [[command]]s that read [[buffer]] names are [[multi-command]]s, so you can act on more than one
buffer during a given command invocation.

These commands all let you use a [[prefix argument]] to control which
buffers are completion candidates.  It is the numeric value of the
prefix arg that matters  Candidates are only the buffers that
satisfy these conditions:

* '''Plain `C-u'''': whose ''[[major mode|mode]]'' is ''derived'' from the current buffer mode
* '''Zero:''' whose ''mode'' is the ''same'' as the current buffer mode
* '''Positive:''' visiting ''files''
* '''Negative:''' associated with the selected ''[[frame]]''

In addition to the usual '''Icicles''' key bindings, during buffer-name
completion you can use the following keys:

* '''`C-x F'''' ('''`icicle-toggle-include-cached-files'''') Toggle whether
`icicle-buffer' includes cached file names as candidates.  That
is, toggle [[option]] '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-buffer-include-cached-files-nflag|icicle-buffer-include-cached-files-nflag]]</tt>''''.
 
* '''`C-x R'''' (`icicle-toggle-include-recent-files') Toggle whether
`icicle-buffer' includes recent file names as candidates.  That
is, toggle option '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-buffer-include-recent-files-nflag|icicle-buffer-include-recent-files-nflag]]</tt>''''.

* '''`C-x C-m -'''' ('''`icicle-remove-buffer-cands-for-derived-mode'''') to ''remove'' the
  buffer-name candidates with a major
  mode that is ''derived from'' a given ''mode''.  You are prompted for the mode.  You can repeat this key to narrow buffer candidates by mode.  (`C-m' is the same key as `RET'.)

* '''`##C-x C-m +##'''' ('''`icicle-keep-only-buffer-cands-for-derived-mode'''') to ''keep only'' the
  buffer-name candidates with a major
  mode that is ''derived from'' a given ''mode''.  You are prompted for the mode.   (`C-m' is the same key as `RET'.)

* '''`C-x M -'''' ('''`icicle-remove-buffer-cands-for-mode'''') -- same as `C-x C-m -', but excludes ancestor modes.


* '''`##C-x M +##'''' ('''`icicle-keep-only-buffer-cands-for-mode'''') -- same as `##C-x C-m +##', but excludes ancestor modes.




* '''`C-x m'''' ('''`icicle-bookmark-non-file-other-window'''') to visit a
  [[BookmarkPlus#AdditionalTypes|bookmarked buffer]].  This is available only if you use library
  '''[[Bookmark+]]'''.  This too is a [[multi-command]], so you can actually
  visit any number of buffer bookmarks with one use of `C-x m'.  When finished, you can
  continue with non-bookmark buffer-name completion.

* '''`S-delete'''' to ''kill'' the buffer named by the current completion
  candidate.

During completion, candidate sorting is specific to buffer names.
`##C-,##' cycles among the following ''sort orders'':

* by ''last access''
* `##*## ... ##*##' last: put buffers such as `*Messages*' and `*Help*' last
* by buffer ''size''
* by ''major mode'' name
* by mode-line mode name (''mode name'' that appears in the [[mode line]])
* by (absolute) ''file'' or ''process'' name

Remember too that the [[mode line|mode-line]] candidate help for a buffer-name
candidate includes the mode name, buffer size, and associated
file or directory, if any.  The directory name can be especially helpful for [[Dired]]
buffer candidates, since the buffer name does not tell you the
full directory.  For example, if you do `C-u C-x b' from Dired, so
the candidates are names of Dired buffers only, then cycling shows you
the directory for each one.

Similarly, the more detailed help available from `C-M-RET'
etc. also lists the full name of the file or directory associated
with the buffer.


Finally, several [[user option]]s control the completion behavior.
See [[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-buffer-match-regexp|buffer-name options]]
and [[Icicles - Global Filters]].

* [[Icicles - Ido and IswitchB]] to use '''Icicles''' with a buffer-switching
  behavior that is similar to [[Ido]] and [[IswitchB]]
* [[Icicles - Progressive Completion#Predicates]] to filter the
  buffer candidates on the fly in multiple ways (e.g. size)
