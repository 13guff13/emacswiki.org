== Buffer-Name Input ==

The '''Icicles''' [[command]]s that read [[buffer]] names are [[multi-command]]s, so you can act on more than one
buffer during a given command invocation.

These commands all let you use a [[prefix argument]] to control which
buffers are completion candidates.  It is the numeric value of the
prefix arg that matters:

* '''Positive:''' only buffers visiting ''files''
* '''Zero:'''     only buffers with the ''same [[major mode|mode]]'' as the current buffer
* '''Negative:''' only buffers associated with the selected ''[[frame]]''

In addition to the usual '''Icicles''' key bindings, during buffer-name
completion you can use the following keys:

* '''`C-x M'''' (`icicle-filter-buffer-cands-for-mode') to filter the
  buffer-name candidates to keep only those with a ''given major
  mode''.  You are prompted for the mode.

* '''`C-x m'''' (`icicle-bookmark-non-file-other-window') to visit a
  [[BookmarkPlus#AdditionalTypes|bookmarked buffer]].  This is available only if you use library
  '''[[Bookmark+]]'''.  This too is a [[multi-command]], so you can actually
  visit any number of buffer bookmarks with one use of `C-x m'.  When finished, you can
  continue with non-bookmark buffer-name completion.

* '''`S-delete'''' to ''kill'' the buffer named by the current completion
  candidate.

During completion, candidate sorting is specific to buffer names.
`##C-,##' cycles among the following ''sort orders'':

* by ''last access''
* `##*## ... ##*##' last: put buffers such as `*Messages*' and `*Help*' last
* by buffer ''size''
* by ''major mode'' name
* by mode-line mode name (''mode name'' that appears in the [[mode line]])
* by (absolute) ''file'' or ''process'' name

'''See Also:'''

* [[Icicles - Ido and IswitchB]] to use '''Icicles''' with a buffer-switching
  behavior that is similar to [[Ido]] and [[IswitchB]]
* [[Icicles - Progressive Completion#Predicates]] to filter the
  buffer candidates on the fly in multiple ways (e.g. size)
