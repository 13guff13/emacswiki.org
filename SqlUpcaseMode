A minor mode which converts lower-case SQL keywords to upper-case as you type or otherwise insert text in the buffer -- for instance, killing and yanking an entire SQL query would upcase all keywords in that query.

It utilises the product-specific regexps defined by sql.el, and thus will upcase only the keywords defined for the buffer's `sql-product'. (Note that `sql-mode' buffers default to the `ansi' product.)

==Download==

Download the library from Lisp:sql-upcase-mode.el

==Install==

Place the library somewhere in your Emacs load-path (or use ##M-x package-install-file## for the downloaded file), and add the following to your init file:

 (when (require 'sql-upcase-mode nil :noerror)
   (add-hook 'sql-mode-hook 'sql-upcase-mode)
   (add-hook 'sql-interactive-mode-hook 'sql-upcase-mode))
