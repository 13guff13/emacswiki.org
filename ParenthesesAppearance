==Matching==

When editing Lisp code it is often useful to highlight matching
parentheses eigther when point is on or near a parenthese or when it
is not even close to one.

The following packages all provide such highlighting but differ in
functionality.

===ShowParenMode===

[[image:paren-el-screenshot]]

ShowParenMode highlights matching parens before and after point.  The
library is called paren.el and is part of Emacs.

===ParenSetMode===

This library provides the same functionality as ShowParenMode.  Since
that is already part of Emacs installing this might just be confusing
when you turn of one of the modes but forget that another mode
providing the same functionality is still enabled.

===MicParen===

[[image:mic-paren-el-screenshot]]

MicParen extends the functionality of the two libraries above in
multiple ways.  Among other things it shows the matching paren in the
EchoArea if it is outside the visible screen.

==Nesting==

The nesting of sexps can also be made more apparent by highlighting
the parens around point.

===HighlightParentheses===

[[image:highlight-parentheses-el-screenshot]]

HighlightParentheses highlights the surrounding parens, showing nesting structure.

==General Appearance==

It is also possible to change the appearance of all parens possibly to
make them less visible.

* UnParenMode -- make them invisible
* ParenFace, DimParentheses -- use a special face for them
