Many modern editors and IDEs indicate the location of the fill column with a thin line (in design parlance, a `rule') running the length of the editing window.  The package <tt>[[fill-column-rule.el]]</tt> (by AlpAker) implements this facility in Emacs.

Really neat stuff :)

I've just spotted a small problem. In order to use with EmacsAsDaemon one needs to comment out these lines:

    (unless window-system
        (error "Fill-column-rule only works on window systems"))

Glad you like it.  I'll look into the interaction with EmacsAsDaemon.  (The package definitely doesn't work on a character terminal with v22, but I didn't test it on a terminal with v23.  It might be that character terminals aren't a problem with the newer version.)
