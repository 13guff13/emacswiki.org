[[es:truncateLines]]
Turn off wrapping for a single buffer using `M-x toggle-truncate-lines'.

This is a BufferLocalVariable.
You can also use the following in your InitFile, although we don't recommend it.
{{{
(set-default 'truncate-lines t)
}}}
This setting does not apply to horizontally-split windows.
`C-x 3' splits windows horizontally, where as `C-x 2' splits them vertically.

To turn wrapping on in horizontally-split windows, use the following in your InitFile:
{{{
(setq truncate-partial-width-windows nil)
}}}
We don't recommend it, either, because horizontally split windows are usually too small to read anyway.  Note that this variable is /not/ buffer-local.

See LineWrap for more info.

See PhysicalLineMove for a minor-mode that changes line movement commands (C-n, C-p, C-a, C-e) to take into account wrapped lines; useful if you don't want to truncate lines!
: Isn't this deprecated by M-x visual-line-mode? I don't see what else PhysicalLineMove would bring to the table.
: What I like about truncate-lines versus visual-line-mode is that the former doesn't split on word boundaries and adds symbols to the fringe.

If you want to set truncate-partial-width-windows just for a certain mode, you need
to put the setting in a hook:
{{{
(add-hook 'diff-mode-hook (lambda () (setq truncate-lines t)))
}}}
[new] 
Nano truncates lines so that when you scroll toward the end of one,
the line itself moves to the left independently of the rest of the
text.  I've had a surprisingly hard time finding any talk of this 
feature in emacs.  Is it possible?
