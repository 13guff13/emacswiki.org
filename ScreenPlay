There are two screenplay libraries known.  Both share the same filename.  :(

* http://www.nongnu.org/screenplay/ -- by VanceSimpson
* Lisp:screenplay.el -- by AlexSchroeder

There is also a LaTeX Document Class called "plari" by Antti-Juhani Kaijanaho for screen plays.
You can find it on any CTAN-mirror.  

== More info on the package by Alex Schroeder ==

Type your screen play as you would on a typewritter.  When you are
done, reformat the plain text using Lisp:screenplay.el.
[Google:Screenwriter%27s+Bible+David+Trottier The Screenwriter's Bible by David Trottier] seems
to suggest that the formatting by screenplay.el is good enough.

The screen play formatter recognizes the following:

Paragraphs of text starting in column 0 are considered to be
'''description'''.  They are formatted like normal paragraphs in text
mode.  A fill-column of 65 is used.  Paragraphs are separated by an
empty line.

Paragraphs of text starting on any other column are considered to be
'''dialogue'''.  They are reformatted with a left margin of 10
characters and a fill-column of 45.  Paragraphs are separated by an
empty line.

Lines of text not starting on column zero and enclosed in parenthesis
are considred to be '''actor's instructions'''.  They are indented to
column 16.  Actor's instructions spanning multiple lines are not
recognized.  This text should go into the description.  There will be
no empty lines before or after actor's instructions.

Lines of text in all caps starting on column 0 are considered to be
'''headings''' and are left alone.  There will be two empty lines
before headings.

Lines of text in all caps starting on any other column are considered
to be '''character names''' and indented to column 22.  There will be
no empty line following a character name.
