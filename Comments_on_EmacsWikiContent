I think this is an excellent idea! :)

I really like this idea! I'm myself interested in helping out with noob pages, as I was a noob year ago. While I found this Wiki helpful supplement, the presentation leaves much to be desired. I think I'm gonna do some research on what needs to be done and I shall put a sketch of the 'Noob project' here then.

FWIW, I have no idea what this page is about.  I tried clicking the title, but (probably because the page is new) no pages linking to it turned up in the hit list.

OK, so I then guessed that there must be a page with the same name but without the prefix ##Comments on ##, and I was able to find the page that way.

Clearly there should be an easy way to get to the page being commented on.

DrewAdams: look at the bottom of the page, there is a "talk" page. Also see here for discussion about it: [[Comments_on_2012-03-20]]
