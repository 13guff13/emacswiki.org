I think this is an excellent idea! :)

I really like this idea! I'm myself interested in helping out with noob pages, as I was a noob year ago. While I found this Wiki helpful supplement, the presentation leaves much to be desired. I think I'm gonna do some research on what needs to be done and I shall put a sketch of the 'Noob project' here then.
