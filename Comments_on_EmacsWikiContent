I think this is an excellent idea! :)

I really like this idea! I'm myself interested in helping out with noob pages, as I was a noob year ago. While I found this Wiki helpful supplement, the presentation leaves much to be desired. I think I'm gonna do some research on what needs to be done and I shall put a sketch of the 'Noob project' here then.

FWIW, I have no idea what this page is about.  I tried clicking the title, but (probably because the page is new) no pages linking to it turned up in the hit list.

OK, so I then guessed that there must be a page with the same name but without the prefix ##Comments on ##, and I was able to find the page that way.

Clearly there should be an easy way to get to the page being commented on.

DrewAdams: look at the bottom of the page, there is a "talk" link. Also see here for discussion about it: [[Comments_on_2012-03-20]]

I think that one thing that might help would be a "CategoryNeedsAttention" category (or, better, hierarchy of categories) so that people with time to kill know where to focus.

I also think that the projects should all be part of a "CategoryProject" category, and that the pages that could benefit from that project should all be categorized appropriately. This would allow both progress to be noticed and the ability for people to get pulled in from the end-points, not just the center.

Of course I could do it myself but I feel like too much of a lurker.

Brandon:  Just do it!  Seriously.  Be brave. Jump in there.  What is the worst that is going to happen?  Someone might disagree with you, and start having a conversation with you about it.

That is all.  :)

The only reason why I didn't start with a Category Project category, is that I wanted something simple.  If this idea takes off, great!  I would love to see a CategoryProject show up, and this page split off.  I jsut am not sure if it is going to take off.

CategoryNeedsAttention however.. that needs to be made.
