This is a (trivial) wrapper around pcache.el, providing "soft"
fetch and store routines which never throw an error, but instead
return nil on failure.

The library is available at github:

: https://github.com/rolandwalker/persistent-soft

and via <nowiki>EmacsWiki</nowiki>:

: Lisp:persistent-soft.el
