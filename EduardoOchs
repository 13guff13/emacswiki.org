**Important news** (march 2012): people have been pointing out for ages that eev.el was too big and too weird, and that each of its well-documented ways of sending commands to external programs - see for example [http://angg.twu.net/eev-current/anim/channels.anim.html this animation] - required a non-trivial amount of set-up to work... well, no longer! Take a look at [http://angg.twu.net/eev-current/eepitch.el.html eepitch.el].

Also, the recommended way to install [http://angg.twu.net/eev-article.html eev.el] is now through its [http://angg.twu.net/debian/README.html Debian package].

(The rest of this page is from 2008...)

And [http://angg.twu.net/eev-current/anim/channels.html here] is an animation in [http://gplflash.sourceforge.net/ Flash] (made with [http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/vnc2swf/ vnc2swf]) showing Emacs creating two xterms and sending commands to them.

2005jan01: a new "official" version - [http://angg.twu.net/eev-0.95.0.tar.gz 0.95.0] - has just been released. It has *lots* of changes since the previous versions. But it's probably better to download the [http://angg.twu.net/eev-0.95.0.tar.gz tarball of the current version] instead.
