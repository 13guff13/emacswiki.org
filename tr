Wasting valuable time online, I wrote this:


{{{
(defun tr (str from to)
  "Replace all characters in STR listed in FROM
with characters listed in TO. If FROM is longer
than TO, then the excess characters are deleted.

\(tr \"abcdefg\" \"abcd\" \"ABC\"\) => \"ABCefg\""
  (dotimes (i (length str))
    (let* ((c1 (aref str i))
	   (pos (progn
		  (string-match (char-to-string c1) from)
		  (match-beginning 0)))
	   (c2 (ignore-errors
		 (aref to pos))))
      (when pos
	(aset str pos (or c2 0)))))
  (replace-regexp-in-string "\000" "" str))
}}}

[new]
The above code does not work for me so I wrote a new function ourcomments-tr and added that to [NxhtmlMode nXhtml].
