= Introduction =

This program is based on the swank-fuzzy.lisp distributed SLIME itself.
Thanks the CL implementation authors for that useful software.

This file provides a single function, `el-swank-fuzzy-completions',
which you can use for the SLIME/swank's FUZZY-COMPLETIONS alike completion function for Emacs Lisp.

- how do you use this as a replacement for lisp-complete-symbol in elisp code? There are no interactive functions defined in el-swank-fuzzy.el

= Elisp =

* Lisp:el-swank-fuzzy.el
