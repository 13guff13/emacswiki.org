This program is based on the swank-fuzzy.lisp distributed SLIME itself.
Thanks the CL implementation authors for that useful software.

This file provides a single function, `el-swank-fuzzy-completions',
which you can use for the SLIME/swank's FUZZY-COMPLETIONS alike completion function for Emacs Lisp.
