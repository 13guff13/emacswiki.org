'''<nowiki>ErbotPisg</nowiki>''': Pisg is a software that helps you create fun channel statistics from channel logs.  To create channel statistics from erbot's logs, see:  http://www.math.tu-berlin.de/~freundt/ErbotPage.html

== Natural Language Translation ==
You need to have libtranslate-bin installed. Ubuntu Dapper provides it here: http://packages.ubuntu.com/dapper/libs/libtranslate-bin, debian does not yet provide it. From then on, simply enable your bot's erbot-translate-p and disable erbot-paranoid-p. See also more technical notes at the bottom of ErbotEmacs. Here are some examples:

== Local Copy ==
How to interact with your local erbot without connecting to the internet?

No way currently, except for these hacks: 

* You can always su to erbot and M-x bbdb to view/edit its database.

* Install a local irc server and then join the irc server 127.0.0.1.



== Startup == 
What's a handy way to start up erbot?

       screen -d -m emacs -nw -f erbot-join-servers

This should start up erbot and have it join the channel you want.  You won't realize this, of course, because screen will have detached the process.  To get at that emacs process, reattach screen:

        screen -r

or 


       screen -DR <name>

=== Functions for internal variables ===

<pre>
<deego> [FTOTD]: Many internal variables can be examined by calling a corresponding *function*. Eg: ,,(fs-features),,                                                                                         
        which also gets invoked if you type ,features.

=== ,df foo behavior ===
<pre>
<deego> [FTOTD] [re: jlf.. and ..  dwim] When you ,df foo, it  looks for both 'foo and 'fs-foo, in that                                                                                                       
        order. (Exception: ,df fs-foo does not look for fs-fs-foo, of course!). Most English commands have such                                                                                               
        adaptive, dwim behavior. Lispy invocations, otoh, tend to do-what-you-wrote.
