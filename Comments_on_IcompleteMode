This page is out of date for icomplete in 24.4+. Should it be removed to avoid giving inaccurate info?

What's out-of-date about it? I use Emacs 24.5 daily with Icomplete mode (and Emacs 25.1, until it crashes). AFAICT, everything written on this page is still relevant.  Be specific about what you think needs updating.
