This package provides a framework for completion of column and table names for SqlMode.

* Lisp:sql-complete.el

First, you have to set the data dictionary up.  Call `M-x sql-oracle-data-dictionary'.  This will send a select statement to the host that dumps the data dictionary.  The data dictionary is then read and stored in a lisp variable.  Based on this information, `M-x sql-complete' now completes columns and tables.  Bind `sql-complete' to any key you like in `sql-mode-map' and `sql-interactive-mode-map'.

If you want to add support for a new database vendor, proceed as follows:

* Write a new defcustom called `sql-TYPE-data-dictionary' similar to `sql-oracle-data-dictionary'.  Its value must be a SQL statement which returns the data dictionary as a long list of `("TABLE NAME" "COLUMN NAME")' rows.  You don't need to parse the resulting output -- the framework does that for you.
* Write a new defun called `sql-TYPE-data-dictionary' similar to `sql-oracle-data-dictionary'.  There will be no name clash as variables and functions are in different name spaces.  The function does nothing but save the parsed data dictionary in the `sql-data-dictionary' variable.  This effectively switches the data dictionary to use.

Here is the Oracle example again:

   (defcustom sql-oracle-data-dictionary
     "select '(\"'||table_name||'\" \"'||column_name||'\")'
      from user_tab_columns 
      order by table_name;"
     "SQL Statement to determine all tables and columns."
     :group 'SQL
     :type 'string)

   (defun sql-oracle-data-dictionary ()
     (interactive)
     (setq sql-data-dictionary
           (sql-data-dictionary sql-oracle-data-dictionary)))

As you can see, it is not too difficult.

The parsed data dictionary as returned by the function `sql-data-dictionary' and stored in the variable of the same name is very simple: It as an alist where the table name is the key and the list of columns is the value.  Here is an example:

   '(("PERSON" "PERSONID" "NAME" "FIRSTNAME" "JOBID")
     ("JOB" "JOBID" "TITLE" "DESCRIPTION" "BASE_SALARY"))

You can bind the functions `sql-complete' and `sql-complete-table' (which only completes on table names to any key you want.

Mysql has a problem with this setup. There are no SELECT'able metadata views. There are commands to retreve the metadata:

    show tables;
    show columns from some_table;

But the format they return is fixed. I'm about to write a defun to parse & munge the results into the required format - but it seems like the interface might need to be modified. Ideas? - JoshRobb

What about completion for table names with schema prefix? 
i slightly customize sql-oracle-data-dictionary

    select '("'||owner||'.'||table_name||'" "'||column_name||'")'
       from all_tab_columns 
       order by table_name;

But its seems that after dot completion looks only for columns names.
