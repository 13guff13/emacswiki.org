When editing a page or running maintenance, the wiki will create locks.
If it then crashes due to a bug, the lock will be left behind.
The symptoms are:

# Delays of about five seconds when loading pages
# An error when trying to save a file claiming that the main lock could not be removed

How to proceed:

# Check how old the lock is.  It /could/ be maintenance taking a few minutes only.
  You can see the lock directories here: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/temp/
# Check what processes are running.
  You'll find them here: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/pids/
# Remove the locks:
  Follow the _Administration_ link at the bottom of the page and click on _Unlock the wiki_.
  That will take you here: http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs?action=unlock

Couldn't the unlock operation be written as a shell script and cron job?
I've known of related bugs in PHP Web environments.  The fix was to actually restart the Apache Web server to avoid hiccups related to MySQL connections. It was a hack, but it kept things running until the bug was found. -- AaronHawley

I'm hope that the crashes will tell us something about the problem; that's why I'd rather know about them.
