== Introduction ==
Tabbar ruler is an emacs package that allows both the tabbar and the
ruler to be used together.  In addition it allows auto-hiding of the
menu-bar and tool-bar.


Tabbar appearance based on reverse engineering Aquaemacs code and
changing to my preferences, and Emacs Wiki.

Tabbar/Ruler integration is new. Tabbar should be active on mouse
move.  Ruler should be active on self-insert commands.

Also allows auto-hiding of toolbar and menu.

To use this, put the library in your load path and use

{{{
  (setq tabbar-ruler-global-tabbar 't) ; If you want tabbar
  (setq tabbar-ruler-global-ruler 't) ; if you want a global ruler
  (setq tabbar-ruler-popup-menu 't) ; If you want a popup menu.
  (setq tabbar-ruler-popup-toolbar 't) ; If you want a popup toolbar
  
  (require 'tabbar-ruler)

}}}

* <b>27-Mar-2013 </b> --   Fixed typo to fix issue #2. (Matthew L. Fidler)
* <b>27-Mar-2013 </b> --   Attempt to fix issue #2. Whenever the color is not a string, assume that it should be transparent. I'm unsure if the mac osx puts the translated color to a string. However, it seems that the undefined should be the same as transparent. Therefore, this fix *should* work... (Matthew L. Fidler)
* <b>20-Mar-2013 </b> --   Add inverse video option for unselected tabbar. Made it the default. has better contrast between the selected and unselected tabs. (Matthew L. Fidler)
* <b>20-Mar-2013 </b> --   Changed emacs 24.3 to support the times character. Also removed starred documentation strings. (Matthew L. Fidler)
* <b>20-Mar-2013 </b> --   Emacs 24.3 had an error when using ucs-insert. Added fallbacks so that this works when ucs-insert does not work. (Matthew L. Fidler)
* <b>20-Feb-2013 </b> --   Changed so that the separators do not need to be fancy images. I found that when the separators were images, it slowed down emacs on windows. Therefore, the fancy images are disabled by default. This also includes the stylized close symbols. (Matthew L. Fidler)

* <b>06-Dec-2012 </b> --   Now colors are based on loaded theme (from minibar). Also added bug-fix for setting tabbar colors every time a frame opens. Also added a bug fix for right-clicking a frame that is not associated with a buffer. 1-Mar-2012 Matthew L. Fidler Last-Updated: Thu Mar 1 08:38:09 2012 (-0600) #656 (Matthew L.
