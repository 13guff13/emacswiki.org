Zone mode 'zones' emacs out, choosing one of its random modes to obfuscate the current buffer, which can be used as a screensaver. With the following you can lock X11 with M-x lock-screen:

 (defun lock-screen ()
   "Lock screen using (zone) and xtrlock
 calls M-x zone on all frames and runs xtrlock"
   (interactive)
   (save-excursion
     ;(shell-command "xtrlock &")
     (set-process-sentinel
      (start-process "xtrlock" nil "xtrlock")
      '(lambda (process event)
         (zone-leave-me-alone)))
     (zone-when-idle 1)))

NOTE: this depends on the program xtrlock (package 'xtrlock' in Debian GNU/Linux)
