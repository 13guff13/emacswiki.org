[[fr:Carrelage de Frames]]

'''This page is part of the description of OneOnOneEmacs, by DrewAdams'''

I created two commands to tile the visible [[frame]]s either horizontally
or vertically: `tile-frames-horizontally' and
`tile-frames-vertically'. I use these especially just
before using ediff commands to compare or merge buffers.

Here's a screenshot of my Windows desktop showing comparison, using `ediff', of two buffers previously tiled horizontally:

'''See Library:''' <tt>[[frame-cmds.el]]</tt>.  It also has frame other commands, such as commands to maximize in different directions.

'''See Also:''' FisheyeWithThumbs for tiling frame thumbnails.
