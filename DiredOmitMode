DiredOmitMode lets you hide uninteresting files, such as backup files and AutoSave files, from the DiredMode view.

It is defined in the dired-x package, so you must also arrange to load dired-x:

    ;; Load Dired-x when Dired is loaded.
    (add-hook 'dired-load-hook '(lambda () (require 'dired-x)))

    ;; Enable toggling of uninteresting files.
    (setq dired-omit-files-p t)

M-o in dired buffers will toggle hiding of files. Variables <code>dired-omit-files</code> (note: no `-p' at end) and <code>dired-omit-extensions</code> together define the uninteresting files.

'''See also Dired+''' (DiredPlus), for a way to color less-interesting files differently in Dired. Combined with DiredOmitMode, this can do either of the following:
* Give you two levels of disinterest.
* Let you ''see'' uninteresting files, but not have them stand out.
