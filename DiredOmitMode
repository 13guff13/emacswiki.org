DiredOmitMode lets you hide uninteresting files, such as backup files and AutoSave files, from the DiredMode view.

It is defined in the [[Dired X]] package, so you must also arrange to load that:

    ;; Load Dired X when Dired is loaded.
    (add-hook 'dired-load-hook '(lambda () (require 'dired-x)))

    ;; Enable toggling of uninteresting files.
    (setq dired-omit-files-p t)

`M-o' in Dired buffers will toggle hiding of files. Variables `dired-omit-files' (note: no `-p' at end) and `dired-omit-extensions' together define the uninteresting files.

With most recent Emacs versions (e.g. 23.1.92.1) no hooks are needed and the following lines in your .emacs enable omit mode (in this example "dot" files are omitted):

    (require 'dired-x)

    (setq-default dired-omit-files-p t) ; this is buffer-local variable

    (setq dired-omit-files
          (concat dired-omit-files "\\|^\\..+$"))


'''See also Dired+''' (DiredPlus), for a way to color less-interesting files differently in Dired. Combined with DiredOmitMode, this can do either of the following:
* Give you two levels of disinterest.
* Let you ''see'' uninteresting files, but not have them stand out.
