DiredOmitMode lets you hide uninteresting files, such as backup files and AutoSave files, from the DiredMode view.

It is defined in the [[Dired X]] package, so you must also arrange to load that:

    ;; Load Dired X when Dired is loaded.
    (add-hook 'dired-load-hook '(lambda () (require 'dired-x)))

    ;; Enable toggling of uninteresting files.
    (setq dired-omit-files-p t)

`M-o' in Dired buffers will toggle hiding of files. Variables `dired-omit-files' (note: no `-p' at end) and `dired-omit-extensions' together define the uninteresting files.

'''See also Dired+''' (DiredPlus), for a way to color less-interesting files differently in Dired. Combined with DiredOmitMode, this can do either of the following:
* Give you two levels of disinterest.
* Let you ''see'' uninteresting files, but not have them stand out.
