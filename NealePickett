I used to think I'd never need to know LISP.  I was wrong.

At first, when I accidentally overwrote my Windows hard drive with Linux, I switched between Emacs and vi a lot.  All I knew about Emacs was that it took a long time to start up.  Then one day while learning PGP, I came across a newsgroup post about MailCrypt, which mentioned that it integrated seamlessly with Emacs MailUserAgents, noting "You *do* use Emacs to read your mail, don't you?"  In fact, I didn't, but I figured it would be worth trying, so I launched [[Rmail]].  That led to ViewMail (VM), and then [[Gnus]].

Later on, I began using EmacsIRCClient, then CalendarMode with AppointmentMode, and now I've all but done away with my xterm with [[Eshell]].  My X setup now consists of an Emacs window running full-screen under [[ratpoison]], occasionally a web browser, and that's all.

Ever since GNU Emacs 20.1 came out, I use Emacs.  Before that I preferred XEmacs.

Hah, I fixed [[rcirc-controls.el]] and was about to paste the new code when I realized that you had done the very same fix yesterday. Awesome. -- AlexSchroeder
