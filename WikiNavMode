Wiki-nav mode is a minor mode for navigating files via &#91;&#91;wiki-style&#93;&#93; double-bracketed links.

It is not related to EmacsWikiMode and similar tools for building a personal Wiki.  Instead,
wiki-nav mode is designed to help you navigate around in the files you already have.

It provides functionality similar to LinkdMode.  Wiki-nav mode uses a different syntax than LinkdMode, is simpler and less sophisticated.

Wiki-nav is distributed with ButtonLockMode:
