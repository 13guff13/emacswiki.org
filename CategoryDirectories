Some of these packages, including lslisp, do not seem to be in xemacs
   21.4.17, at least.  those of us trying to find a way to do
   ##--time-style = iso## in xemacs find ourselves stymied by the way the
   dired code handles switches.  is xemacs on the way out, at least
   for dired?  -- gambarimasu
