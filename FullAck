[http://nschum.de/src/emacs/full-ack/ full-ack] is another front-end for [[Ack]].

Full-ack version 0.2.2 or newer is required if you use Ack version 1.94 or newer.

: //Where does 0.2.2 come from? Website and ELPA only have 0.2.1 -- MichaelIvey//
 
On Debian you probably want to add this :

(setq ack-executable (executable-find "ack-grep"))

to make it works since the executable is called ack-grep and not ack
