Mercurial (aka <code>hg</code>) is a distributed version control system much like [[Git]], [[Bazaar]]
and DaRcs.

Mercurial is available from http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/Mercurial.

== Modes ==

* [[VC]] -- supports Mercurial.
* [[DVC]] -- supports Mercurial.
* MercurialMode -- A user interface specific to Mercurial.

[new]
vc-hg-push and vc-hg-pull are broken in vc-hg.el (emacs23). vc-hg-command has to be called via an apply.
