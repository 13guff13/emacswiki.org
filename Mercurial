Mercurial (aka <code>hg</code>) is a distributed version control system much like [[Git]], [[Bazaar]]
and DaRcs.

Mercurial is available from http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/Mercurial.

== Modes ==

* [[VC]] -- supports Mercurial.
* [[DVC]] -- supports Mercurial.
* MercurialMode -- A user interface specific to Mercurial.
* [https://es.fbk.eu/people/griggio/ahg.html aHg] -- A simple Mercurial UI inspired by DVC
* [https://github.com/ananthakumaran/monky monky] -- A Mercurial interface that imitates [[Magit]]

vc-hg-push and vc-hg-pull are broken in vc-hg.el (emacs23). vc-hg-command has to be called via an apply.

== Using diff-mode for MQ patches ==

Mercurial's MQ extension uses patch files which are more convenient to
read with [[DiffMode]]. diff-mode can not, however, guess the
correct base directory, so applying and reverting hunks won't work out
of the box. Here's a hook that fixes the problem:

  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.hg/patches\\(?:-[^/]+\\)?/" . diff-mode))

  (defun mq-patch-set-default-directory ()
    (when (string= ".hg" (nth 2 (reverse (split-string default-directory "/"))))
      (setq default-directory (expand-file-name (concat default-directory "../../")))))
  (add-hook 'diff-mode-hook 'mq-patch-set-default-directory)

== Breaking hardlinks in local clones ==

When you create clones of local Mercurial repositories, Mercurial will try to create hardlinks
to save space [http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/HardlinkedClones HardlinkedClones].  This works
fine as long as Emacs is setup to break links.  The problem I have is that some hardlinks
on my system need to stay hardlinked, and I cannot globally set 'break-hardlink-on-save to t.
This hook below, gets around the problem by ask what to do when saving a file that has hardlinks.

  (defun ask-to-break-hardlink ()
    (if (and (file-exists-p buffer-file-name) (> (file-nlinks buffer-file-name) 1))
        (if (yes-or-no-p
             (format "File %s is has more than one hardlink; Break the hardlink? "
                     (file-name-nondirectory
                      buffer-file-name)))
            (set (make-local-variable 'break-hardlink-on-save) t)
          (set (make-local-variable 'break-hardlink-on-save) nil)
          )
      )
    )
  
  (add-hook 'before-save-hook 'ask-to-break-hardlink)

This is a different way to force breaking of hardlinks in Mercurial repositories, it forces break-hardlink-on-save to t when vc recognizes the file:

  (defadvice vc-hg-registered (after vc-hg-registered-break-hardlink activate)
    "Break hardlinks when editing in a Mercurial repository"
    (if ad-return-value
        (progn
          (set (make-local-variable 'break-hardlink-on-save) t)
          ))
    ad-return-value)
