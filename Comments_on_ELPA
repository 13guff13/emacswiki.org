It would be helpful if this page described how to add a package to Gnu ELPA. Part of the answer is here:
http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs/elpa.git/tree/README

But that does not describe how to specify the package meta-data. According to this post:
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.devel/166724

we don't write a <package>-pkg.el file.

One thing this page doesn't touch on, which I found a bit odd: how to actually install a package.

So I agree with kenahoo.   I came here because there was some functionality that I wanted that wasn't in the base version of emacs, but it IS available in an ELPA package.    I have no need *today* to actually do package devleopment.   I just want to install an ELPA package, and start using it and go on my way.  

BUT I CANNOT FIGURE OUT HOW.  All of the instructions seemed aimed at people who "already know".
