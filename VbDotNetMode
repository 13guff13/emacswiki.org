It seems that I am the only Emacs user unlucky enough to be working on a VB project.  Well, VB.NET actually. That's not quite so evil.  I'm gradually adding support for VB.NET syntax to the aging visual-basic-mode.  Most VB.NET code should be parsed correctly now.  I don't know if it will still work with old VBA code, but this doesn't really matter as the name has changed to vbnet-mode.
Offers of help will be gratefully accepted, I can be reached at timseal at gmail dot com.

The code is at Lisp:vbnet-mode.el
 I will put comments in to make the changes more obvious soon.

I've just updated vbnet-mode.el to v1.5.  

Summary of changes: 

* replaced many defvar to defcustom, to make it more user friendly.
* fixed fontification for using statements, vars, namespaces, imports, and so on. It looks pretty good now. 
* fixed indent of Namespaces, property getters and setters, and shared functions. 
* integration with flymake.el 
* Integration with ya-snippet.el
* integration with compile.el 
* a bunch of other stuff. 


here's a screen shot.

Installation instructions

 Put vbnet-mode.el somewhere in your load path, optionally compile
 it, and add the following to your .emacs file:

   (autoload 'vbnet-mode "vbnet-mode" "Mode for editing VB.NET code." t)
   (setq auto-mode-alist (append '(("\\.\\(frm\\|bas\\|cls\\|vb\\)$" .
                                 vbnet-mode)) auto-mode-alist))

 And optionally, add something like this to your .emacs file as well:

   (defun my-vbnet-mode-fn ()
     "My hook for VB.NET mode"
     (interactive)
     ;; This is an example only.
     ;; These statements are not required to use VB.NET, but
     ;; you might like them.
     (turn-on-font-lock)
     (turn-on-auto-revert-mode)
     (setq indent-tabs-mode nil)
     (require 'flymake)
     (flymake-mode 1)
     ...other mode-setup code here...
   )
   (add-hook 'vbnet-mode-hook 'my-vbnet-mode-fn)
