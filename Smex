Smex is a ##M-x## enhancement for Emacs. Built on top of [InteractivelyDoThings IDO], it provides a convenient interface to your recently and most frequently used commands. And to all the other commands, too.

Extras: Limit commands to those relevant to the active major mode. Show frequently used commands that have no key bindings.

/Wicked cool./ Is it inspired by this [http://www.vimeo.com/1013263 video]? :)
