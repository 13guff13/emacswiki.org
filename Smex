Smex is a ##M-x## enhancement for Emacs. Built on top of [InteractivelyDoThings IDO], it provides a convenient interface to your recently and most frequently used commands. And to all the other commands, too.

Extras: Limit commands to those relevant to the active major mode. Show frequently used commands that have no key bindings.

Does anyone know how to modify smex so that typing a space will insert a hyphen '-' like in normal M-x?
: Space already has the function of paging through the list of possible completions. But what's even better than typing a space is not typing anything; I see that in smex you can just type the function name as one word without hyphens, and it still works, including auto-completion. BTW, I think smex is very cool! -- ThomasKappler

: I disagree that not typing anything is better than typing a space. Commands often have a word-like structure, and the separation is important. So I'm adding my voice the the request for a way to restore the old functionality and have the space key insert a hyphen.

: This issue is not specific to Smex and a fix would benefit all Ido users. It will be addressed by the next Smex release.

: I did not mean to imply that the issue is specific to smex. Indeed, the same issue occurs when following the instructions to add [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InteractivelyDoThings#toc5/ M-x support to ido]. Thanks for taking this on, it will really make it easier for me to use smex!

/Wicked cool./ Is it inspired by this [http://www.vimeo.com/1013263 video]? :)
