== Intro ==
[[image:SmexScreenshotImage]]

Smex is a ##M-x## enhancement for Emacs. Built on top of [InteractivelyDoThings IDO], it provides a convenient interface to your recently and most frequently used commands. And to all the other commands, too.

Extras: Limit commands to those relevant to the active major mode. Show frequently used commands that have no key bindings.

=== Delayed Initiation ===

I install smex with the following code to make emacs startup a little faster.  This delays initializing smex until it's needed.  IMO, smex should load without this hack.  Just have smex call 'smex-initialize' when it's needed instead of having the user do it. --LeWang

{{{

(global-set-key [(meta x)] (lambda ()
                             (interactive)
                             (or (boundp 'smex-cache)
                                 (smex-initialize))
                             (global-set-key [(meta x)] 'smex)
                             (smex)))

(global-set-key [(shift meta x)] (lambda ()
                                   (interactive)
                                   (or (boundp 'smex-cache)
                                       (smex-initialize))
                                   (global-set-key [(shift meta x)] 'smex-major-mode-commands)
                                   (smex-major-mode-commands)))

=== Hyphen on Space ===
How to modify smex so that typing a space will insert a hyphen ‘-’ like in normal M-x?
{{{
      (defadvice smex (around space-inserts-hyphen activate compile)
        (let ((ido-cannot-complete-command 
               `(lambda ()
                  (interactive)
                  (if (string= " " (this-command-keys))
                      (insert ?-)
                    (funcall ,ido-cannot-complete-command)))))
          ad-do-it))
}}}
If there is only one match it will be completed instead of inserting a hyphen (which may well be a desirable thing). To avoid that, fset ##ido-complete-space## to that lambda form above, then fset it back after ##ad-do-it## (##flet## doesn't work for interactive functions).

=== Update less often ===
[new:jpkotta:2011-04-08 15:44 UTC]
I don't like to have smex update every time I run (auto-update is usually good enough, and is noticeably faster).  But it's annoying when I manually load a file and the new commands are not in smex.  So I add a smex-update to after-load-functions.

    (defun smex-update-after-load (unused)
      (when (boundp 'smex-cache)
        (smex-update)))
    (add-hook 'after-load-functions 'smex-update-after-load)

=== Using acronyms ===
You can see mnemonical commands (within completion) before the others with this code snippet:
{{{
(defadvice ido-set-matches-1 (after ido-acronym-matches activate)
  (if (> (length ido-text) 1)
    (let ((regex (concat "^" (mapconcat 'char-to-string ido-text "[^-]*-")
                         "[^-]*$")))
      (setq ad-return-value
            (append (reverse (remove-if-not (lambda (i)
                                              (string-match regex i)) items))
                    ad-return-value)))))
}}}
e.g. <b>without</b> this code the completion of 'ffow' shows:
<pre>
{ ediff-show-registry | Buffer-menu-1-window | Buffer-menu-2-window ...
</pre>
<b>with</b>:
<pre>
{ find-file-other-window | find-function-other-window | ediff-show-registry ...
</pre>

[new]
<b>Warning:</b> as you can see, this is an advice for 'ido-set-matches-1' and it's run on every 'ido-completing-read'. Is there a way to ignore all calls but smex?
