I'm an editor of the EmacsWiki. I invite all Emacs and XEmacs users to
take up editing responsibilities as well. All you need to do is edit
new pages, correct typos, add categories, rework pages. A good rule of
thumb I try to follow is to make all pages potential sections in a
printed book or info manual.

I usually don't sign my contributions because I think that encourages
other people to rework the page. And signing contributions would not
make sense in a traditional book.

You can contact me using mailto:kensanata@gmail.com.

I use Emacs.

I am also known as [::kensanata] on IRC.

"Kensanata" doesn't mean anything. It was the name of my character
when I started [http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/alex?J%C3%BCnger_des_Blauen_Mondes playing PBEM games].
I started my first homepage for this game on Geocities and needed an account name.
Instead of alex4365472432009 I chose a name related to the game. And
since Geocities and Yahoo and AOL started to cooperate, "kensanata"
turned out to be the name of my Yahoo mailbox and my AIM handle.
Later, I also used it on ICQ. And now I'm using it on IRC.

On Sourceforge, I am also `kensanata'. On Savannah, however, I am
`as'.

== RSI ==

RepeatedStrainInjury -- saw a doctor, started physiotherapy on
2002-02-05. I bought a Kinesis keyboard. I used little programs that
forced me to take a lot of breaks. It didn't help. I stopped therapy
2002-10-21 and decided to work less, get up more often, started
practicing Aikido, and no longer work in long shifts. That helped.
