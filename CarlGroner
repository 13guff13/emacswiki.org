Hi, I'm [http://www.komputermaschine.com Carl] and I use emacs. 

I'm currently exploring GNU Emacs, [EmacsLisp emacs lisp] and [CommonLisp common lisp] on [EmacsOnGnuLinux linux] and [EmacsForMacOS OS X]. My DotEmacs is posted [http://github.com/komputermaschine/dotfiles/tree/master here].


==Emacs Projects==
* Lisp:tumbl.el ([[Tumbl]]) -- Post to tumblr.com from emacs
* [http://github.com/komputermaschine/dotfiles/tree/master dotfiles] - Includes my DotEmacs setup (on github)

Hi and welcome to the wiki. Your library looks nice, I was going to
point "conventional headers for Emacs libraries" in the elisp manual
out to you but it turns out you got it right and I forgot how they
should be formatted:) -[[avar]]
