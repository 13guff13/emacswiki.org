= ProjectLocalVariables

This file allows you to create .emacs-project files that are evaluated
when a file is opened. You may also create .emacs-project-$MODE files
that only get loaded when you open files of a specific mode in the
project. All files for which a .emacs-project file exists in an
ancestor directory will have it loaded.

Please note that as of May 2008, this functionality has been implemented
in Emacs, so there's no need for this library. See "Directory Variables"
in the Emacs Manual.

I don't see this "Directory Variables" functionality in Aquamacs 1.5
(based on GNU Emacs 22.3.2), so I think that this Lisp file is still
relevant. Luckily it's provided via the [[ELPA]]. --MishaGorodnitzky

*Warning:* This is a severe security hole!  A .emacs-project file can
contain arbitrary Lisp code, which will be run automatically when you
try to open any file in that directory.  Unless you are on a
single-user system, and you never open files from people you don't
trust, /do not use this package/.  Consider using DirVarsPackage instead.

== Adding Project Variables ==

To add a project variable to you .emacs-project or .emacs-project-$MODE,
define it using the function 'setl':

    (setl ruby-indent-level 4)
