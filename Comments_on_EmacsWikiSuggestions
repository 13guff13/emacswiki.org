== ALT Multiple commands on a single key stroke ==

An example of a simple solution to mapping a chain of commands to a single key stroke:
<code>
(setq newline-under-current-line "\C-e\C-o")
(global-set-key "\C-i" newline-under-current-line)
</code>

Wait, what? What does ''ALT Multiple commands on a single key stroke'' that have to do with anything on EmacsWikiSuggestions ?

Maybe it should be moved to EmacsNiftyTricks?

Where is the appropriate place to leave a suggestion for some entries discussing how to create a right-click context menu?  It should not have been necessary for me to have reverse engineered Aquamacs to figure out something so simple:

Googling "emacs right-click context menu" should pull up a page on EmacsWiki describing how to do this.
