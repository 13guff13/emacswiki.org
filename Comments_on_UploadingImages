=== imgur.com hosted images ===
An ''ordinary URL'' is not defined explicitly, but it would appear to require an image-type suffix (eg. <code>.jpg .png .gif</code> etc.)


http://imgur.com is a decent, easy-to-use host that does not require an account (unlike Flickr), but their images are not inlined by default <code>http://imgur.com/K2UweJp</code>

Unless you grab the special URL <code>http://i.imgur.com/mEfHEIZ.png</code>
