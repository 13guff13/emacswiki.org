The section "What RMS would not like to see" is hard to follow. It would be clearer (easier to read) with a bit of typography for each participant. Example:
::   Mail by RMS (Roman type), quoting Alex ([i]Italic type[/i])\\
or\\
::   Mail by RMS (black), quoting Alex ([color=green]green[/color])

I'd fix it myself, but I'm not the author.
