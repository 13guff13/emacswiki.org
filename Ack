[http://search.cpan.org/search?q=App::ack ack] is a replacement for 99% of the uses of <tt>grep</tt>, written in Perl.

There is a grep-like compilation mode for Ack named [http://www.shellarchive.co.uk/content/emacs.html ack.el], as well as FullAck.
An alternative implementation of a grep-like compilation mode is [http://rooijan.za.net/?q=ack_el here (ack.el)].  Alternatively, one can use <tt>M-x rgrep</tt> with ack thusly:

{{{
(custom-set-variables '(grep-program "ack -H -a --nogroup"))
}}}

On emacs 24, it appears to be `grep-command`, not `grep-program`, unless I'm not loading the right library. -- RyanDavis

Ah, no... it `grep-program` is defined in grep.el, but it isn't a customized var. Looks like it needs to be set via `grep-setup-hook` . -- RyanDavis
