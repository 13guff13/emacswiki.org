Unfilling a paragraph joins all the lines in a paragraph into a single line. It is the contrary of [[FillParagraph]].

It works where a line ends with a newline character ("\n") and paragraphs are separated by blank lines.  To make a paragraph end in a single newline then use the function below:

    ;;; Stefan Monnier <foo at acm.org>. It is the opposite of fill-paragraph    
    (defun unfill-paragraph ()
      "Takes a multi-line paragraph and makes it into a single line of text."
      (interactive)
      (let ((fill-column (point-max)))
        (fill-paragraph nil)))

You can convert an entire buffer from paragraphs to lines by recording a macro that calls `unfill-paragraph' and moves past the blank-line to the next unfilled paragraph and then executing that macro on the whole buffer, `C-u 0 C-x e' (see InfiniteArgument).

Also see UnwrapLine.
