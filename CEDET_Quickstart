On [[emacs-devel]], LesHarris said that [[CEDET]] worked for him. "Not only
that it works better now than it ever has before."

He says:

For the screenshot I opened up a random Emacs source file, went to a
random function, and tried to complete a structure.  In this case it was
glyph_matrix, and we can see that CEDET has provided a list of all the
members of the glyph_matrix struct.

There is a bit prettification going on there, I use AutoCompleteMode and
its AC-Semantic backend to do the overlay-based completion window but
the heavy lifting is all CEDET.

This is the configuration he uses:

{{{
;; Semantic
(global-semantic-idle-completions-mode t)
(global-semantic-decoration-mode t)
(global-semantic-highlight-func-mode t)
(global-semantic-show-unmatched-syntax-mode t)

;; CC-mode
(add-hook 'c-mode-hook '(lambda ()
        (setq ac-sources (append '(ac-source-semantic) ac-sources))
        (local-set-key (kbd "RET") 'newline-and-indent)
        (linum-mode t)
        (semantic-mode t)))

;; Autocomplete
(require 'auto-complete-config)
(add-to-list 'ac-dictionary-directories (expand-file-name
             "~/.emacs.d/elpa/auto-complete-1.4.20110207/dict"))
(setq ac-comphist-file (expand-file-name
             "~/.emacs.d/ac-comphist.dat"))
(ac-config-default)
}}}
