Install this to get notified everytime your name is mentioned (except for when your name is mentioned as part of a room listing of who's in the room)

ToDoChiKu is another alternative, that works with Growl, Snarl or libnotify.

<pre>
(defvar growlnotify-command (executable-find "growlnotify") "The path to growlnotify")

(defun growl (title message)
  (start-process "growl" " growl"
                 growlnotify-command
                 title
                 "-a" "Emacs")
  (process-send-string " growl" message)
  (process-send-string " growl" "\n")
  (process-send-eof " growl"))

(defun my-erc-hook (match-type nick message)
  "Shows a growl notification, when user's nick was mentioned. If the buffer is currently not visible, makes it sticky."
  (unless (posix-string-match "^\\** *Users on #" message)
    (growl
     (concat "ERC: name mentioned on: " (buffer-name (current-buffer)))
     message
     )))

(add-hook 'erc-text-matched-hook 'my-erc-hook)
</pre>
