Hi, my name is Alex Scherbanov. I'm a happy emacs user!
Can't live without EmacsMuse with PlannerMode.

My day begins with a cup of green tea. Then I open my planner, plan my day and after breakfast I begin to work.

I have a folder ~/workspace where I keep my projects and my own small wiki.
Several hundreds of planner files, bbdb and diary are disposed in ~/workspace/.plans to be hidden and not to distract my attention. I like the flexibiliby of plain text files: I can do almost anything I could do with my paper note book (plus copypasting and lgrep!) except drawing directly in it. 

On F1 emacs shows me today, two days after and the Taskpool.
On F2 -- today with calendar.
These two keys are quite enough for planning. Very simple WinnerMode is very useful here.

I use only one Taskpool, I just divide it into chapters. Most important tasks go to the top of file.
Some of them go to today page. When I'm done with them, I choose others. Pretty simple.
Also I have Someday file. I wrote all my thoughts and ideas there. For example, "someday I want to learn japanese". I read it periodicaly to look if time already came.

If the information have to be stuctured and to be frequently used, I place it into wiki. Other stuff -- bookmarks, diary, thoughts and comments to books and films -- I place in today page. It lets me save it and later find if needed.

I also have a paper note book which lets me write down anything I would later move to planner.

If you want to get things done, read the book "Getting Things Done" written by David Allen! It gave me many good ideas about better planning. Also read this: [[PlannerModeMethods#GettingThingsDone]]

I use bazaar to synchronize all this stuff on my machines because of it's simplicity. The only problem, I can't find good documentation for [[DVC]] or Lisp:bazaar.el, so I just use bzr in shell. Maybe later I will hack one of them or write my own front-end.
I'm running !FreeBSD on my laptop and Windows XP on my home computer where I sometimes draw with my wacom and do photo retouching. And Emacs is everywhere! It's true multiplatform.

Welcome to the wiki! -- AlexSchroeder

Welcome too ! :) Could you explain how you do "wiki" using EmacsMuse
and PlannerMode ? I do not get it. Also, please describe your
PlannerMode setup so other users could try it too. -- XavierMaillard

Ok. For example, it I prefer to keep algorithm ideas, documentation, and their implementations in different files. Links are very useful here. Also I often leave a long comment for task in day page just for neatness, and the task has link to it's comment. The comment may be already in yesterday file or twenty-days-ago file, but I always can get it very fast.

My customization to the PlannerMode:

 (require 'planner-diary)
 (require 'planner-calendar)
 (add-hook 'diary-display-hook 'fancy-diary-display)
 (planner-insinuate-calendar)

 ;; with these custom faces planner looks cleaner
 (set-face-attribute 'planner-cancelled-task-face nil :strike-through nil)
 (set-face-attribute 'planner-completed-task-face nil :strike-through t :foreground "light gray")
 ;; I do not like the automated sorting
 (setq planner-align-tasks-automatically nil)
 (setq planner-sort-tasks-automatically nil)

 ;; F1 and F2 redefined for planner
 (defun my-window-configuration-three-days-and-plan ()
   "Make a window configuration containing three days and TaskPool"
   (interactive)
   (planner-goto-today)
   (delete-other-windows)
   (split-window-vertically 33)
   (split-window-horizontally)
   (other-window 1)
   (find-file "~/workspace/.plans/TaskPool.muse")
   (other-window 1)
   (planner-goto-tomorrow 1)
   (split-window-horizontally)
   (other-window 1)
   (planner-goto-tomorrow 1)
   (other-window 1))
 (global-set-key (kbd "<f1>") 'my-window-configuration-three-days-and-plan)

 (defun my-window-confiration-calendar ()
   "Make a window configuration containing today and calendar"
   (interactive)
   (planner-goto-today)
   (delete-other-windows)
   (calendar))
 (global-set-key (kbd "<f2>") 'my-window-confiration-calendar)

I also customized day page template. It now has a nice title like this: "#title 10 Jan 2008, Thursday"

 ;; =========== day page template ============
 (defun my-planner-day-page-template ()
   "Good looking date in #title, like this: 10 Jan 2008, Thursday"
   (interactive)
   (if (string-match planner-date-regexp (planner-page-name))
       (insert
        (concat "#title "   ;; the idea is to transform planner-get-current-date-filename (for example, "2008-01-10")
                (format-time-string "%d %b %Y, %A"   ;; and transform it to "10 Jan 2008, Thursday"
                                    (date-to-time
                                     (let ((date (planner-get-current-date-filename)))
                                       (let ((year (substring date 0 4))
                                             (month (substring date 5 7))
                                             (day (substring date 8 10)))
                                         (concat year "-" month "-" day " 12:00:00 [GMT]"))))) ;; we get "2008-01-10 12:00:00 [GMT]" here, date-to-time understands this
                "\n\n* Schedule\n\n<lisp>(planner-diary-entries-here)</lisp>\n\n* Tasks\n\n\n\n* Notes\n\n\n")))) 
 (setq planner-day-page-template 'my-planner-day-page-template)
