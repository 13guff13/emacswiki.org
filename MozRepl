== MozRepl Tricks: Automatically Refresh Browser After Saving HTML/CSS files ==

This snippet triggers a browser refresh every time an .html or .css file is saved in emacs. It uses the emacs MozRepl integration linked to above.

Notes: There is a one-second delay before refreshing the browser. That is set in the: setTimeout(BrowserReload(), "1000"... line. You can change it; it is specified in milliseconds - 1000=1s. 

Also, if you have multiple tabs/windows open it might initially pick the wrong window to refresh - just create a new tab, load the page there and it should start refreshing that tab instead.

<pre>
(defun auto-reload-firefox-on-after-save-hook ()         
          (add-hook 'after-save-hook
                       '(lambda ()
                          (interactive)
                          (comint-send-string (inferior-moz-process)
                                              "setTimeout(BrowserReload(), \"1000\");"))
                       'append 'local)) ; buffer-local

;; Example - you may want to add hooks for your own modes.
;; I also add this to python-mode when doing django development.
(add-hook 'html-mode-hook 'auto-reload-firefox-on-after-save-hook)
(add-hook 'css-mode-hook 'auto-reload-firefox-on-after-save-hook)
</pre>

Nice, but if you are going to experiment with this it might be good to use a named function in the hook instead of a lambda.
That way you can change it and you can also delete it from the hook if you want to.
