Unsurprisingly, OtherMichael uses Emacs.

But only since the summer of 2007, and mainly on [[EmacsW32|Windows]]. As of May, 2008, he's starting to use it on the [[http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Emacs OLPC]] [[http://wiki.laptop.org/go/User:OtherMichael XO]]

If you're an XO user, edits to http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Emacs are more than welcome!

OtherMichael often refers to himself in the third person.

He can also be found online at http://www.xradiograph.com/ and http://www.xradiograph.com/Emacs
