This code provides the ability to 'scribble' on top of any buffer. (It has only been tested on a CVS Build of GNU Emacs, but I don't know of any reason why it shouldn't work fairly widely).

Save the file called "markerpen.el" in a directory in your load-path and add (load-library "markerpen")
 to your ~/.emacs file. Alternatively if you don't have much customization of your own and aren't familiar with load-paths etc, you could just paste the code below straight into your ~/.emacs file.

* Lisp:markerpen.el

----
I think it is rude to `define-key' when the file is loaded.

<pre>
;; disable global-set-key when loading
(flet ((global-set-key (&rest args)()))
  (require 'markerpen))
</pre>

----
To change markerpen with sequence of calls, depends on DoubleKeyBinding.

<pre>
(defun markerpen-mark-region-seq ()
  "Change markerpen with sequence of calls."
  (interactive)
  (flet ((prefix-numeric-value (x) (identity x)))
    (markerpen-clear-region)
    (markerpen-mark-region (1+ (seq-times 'markerpen-mark-region-seq 10)))))
</pre>
