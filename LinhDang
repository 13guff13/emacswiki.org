How come simple routines such as:
* flatten-list
* common-prefix-of-strings
* make-alist-from-2-lists
are missing in emacs. Every package ends up with their own version of those routines.

Maybe you did not look hard enough?

   (try-completion "" '(("Alex") ("Alexandra") ("All")))
   => "Al"

The following requires the CL package:

   (mapcar* 'cons '(a b c d) '(1 2 3 4))
   => ((a . 1) (b . 2) (c . 3) (d . 4))

Personally I have never needed to flatten lists, nor did I have to create alists from two lists, though. -- AlexSchroeder

Re LXR interface: would you mind sharing the code to this?  This would be seriously useful with Mac OS X's Spotlight. -- SeanO
