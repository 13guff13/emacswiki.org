Anything.elはHelmに名前が変更されました (helmはあなたを正しい方向に舵を取るのを助けるでしょう :-) ).

新プロジェクトはGitHub - https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm下にホストされています.
すみませんが, Helmで使われるのに応じて古いanything.elプラグインをアップデートしてください.

= anything.el =

##anything.el##はTamasPatrovicsによって書かれたグレートなアプリケーションフレームワークです.
それは全く新しいEmacs体験を提供します.
通常のEmacsの方法では指定したアクションをしつつ候補を選択しますが, ##anything##の方法ではナローイングし候補を選択した後選択された候補のためにアクションを実行します.

それは"emacs版超拡張可能なspotlight"もしくは"emacs版!QuickSilver"みたいなものです.
##anything.el##の現在のメンテナーは[[rubikitch]]です.

Started with ##M-x anything##　all things matching a given pattern will be shown in a special buffer named ##*anything*##.

最初に全ての候補が表示されます.
次に与えられたクエリーによってそれらは絞りこまれます.
候補はC-p/C-n/C-v/M-v(もしくはup/down/pgup/pgdown)で選択できます.
RETを打つとそのタイプのためにデフォルトアクションを起動し,TABを打つと全ての可能なアクションをリストします.

[[image:AnythingScreenshotAllCandidates]]

[[image:AnythingScreenshotNarrowingCandidates]]

What's queried is given by a list of sources, namely ##anything-sources##, such as buffers, file names, bookmarks, and so on.

これは複数のEmacsコマンドが一つのコマンドに統合されていることを意味します.
あなたはアクションに対応するコマンドを思い出す必要がありません, ##anything##は正しいことを行います.
##anything.el##は[[anything.el]]で手に入れられます.


Here's an easy to follow [http://metasandwich.com/2010/07/30/what-can-i-get-for-10-dolla-anything-el/ introduction explaining how Anything works]
and here's an introduction to [http://metasandwich.com/2010/08/01/anything-else/ creating new sources for Anything].

= anything-config.el =

##anything.el##は基本的なフレームワークといくつかの例のソースだけを含みます.
##anything-config.el## is intended to provide a rich set of additional sources and types that can be used by users to adapt ##anything.el## to their needs.

TassiloHorn, JasonMcBrayer, [[rubikitch]] and ThierryVolpiatto maintain and extend ##anything-config.el##
and the best source for getting the most current version is to clone his ##git## repository. Everybody can push to it as a mob user.

    git clone git://repo.or.cz/anything-config.git

If you have enhancements please drop one of them a mail and they will pull your changes in.
You can also submit patches, see the manual page of ##git format-patch##.

If you have any cool feature, write to AnythingSources page, push to mob repository, or mail me, i will apply it. :) -- [[rubikitch]]

##anything-config.el## can also be downloaded from [[anything-config.el]].

You will find many sources in AnythingSources page.

You can extend Anything by AnythingPlugins.

(It would be good to explain what a config, a source, and a plugin are.  Are they different things?)

: I'll do that. -- [[rubikitch]]
:: See Glossary. Sorry for my poor English. -- [[rubikitch]]

There are a lot of goodies in RubikitchAnythingConfiguration, the current maintainer's configuration. Feel free to copy and paste!

AndyStewart has added some cool extensions : Lisp:anything-extension.el

= Glossary =
; Source : Anything searches objects from various information, such as buffers, recentf, bookmark, and so on.The information source is simply called `source'. You can easily define sources.
; Attribute : A `source' is a list of `attributes', Their names are pre-defined; such as name, candidates, and type.
; Plugin : Anything can be extended via `plugin'. For example, search method in anything itself is single regexp search, but with Lisp:anything-match-plugin.el anything supports multiple regexp search. User-defined `attributes' are also `plugin'.
; Config : Lisp:anything-config.el contains various pre-defined `sources' and `plugins'.

= Installation =

There are various ways to install [[Anything]].

You can clone the git repository:

    git clone git://repo.or.cz/anything-config.git

Then add this to your <tt>~/.emacs.el</tt>:

    (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/anything/")
    (require 'anything-config)

Or you if you want to start with a minimal configuration download just Lisp:anything.el and Lisp:anything-config.el and add the following to your <tt>~/.emacs.el</tt>:

    (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/anything/")
    (require 'anything-config)

If you do not want to use git but want several [[Anything]] packages, related [[Anything]] maintainer's user configs, as well as most of the [[Anything]] extension packages use the WgetSnarfAnything wget script.

Or you can use Lisp:auto-install.el (which you first have to install itself as described in AutoInstall) install [[Anything]] packages with following:

   M-x auto-install-batch RET a n y t h i n g RET

It would be great if it was installable with [[ELPA]] (as of 2011/01/25 I actually can install anything from [[ELPA]])

(As of 2011/12/06, on Emacs 24.0.50.1, Anything can be installed using ELPA)
= Getting Help =
Anything now has a its own mailing list at:

[https://groups.google.com/group/emacs-anything?hl=en]

It is visible also in gmane at gmane.emacs.anything
                
= Getting Started =

Enter emacs and run ##M-x anything-for-file##. It is preconfigured ##anything## to open files.

If you like it and feel the power of anything, set ##anything-sources## for your taste by copying and pasting bits and pieces from other people's anything-config files.
You may wish to bind 'anything to a easy-to-type key.

= Discussion =

[new]
are there any plans to clean up these files? the anything-config file and your own config file are both pretty monolithic, as such it's hard to modify or extend 'anything'.
Maybe separating things into different files, and creating more 'helper' functions would help? for example, isn't the following a simpler way of creating anything functions, than having them build-in/preconfigured?:

 (defvar anything-command-list nil)
 (defmacro defanything (name sources)
   (list 'add-to-list '(intern "anything-command-list") (concat "anything-" name))
   (list 'defun (intern (concat "anything-" name)) (list)
 	(list 'interactive)
 	(list 'anything
 	      (list 'quote
 		    (map 'list
 			 (lambda (x) (intern (concat "anything-c-source-" x)))
 			 sources))
 	      'nil 'nil 'nil 'nil (concat "*" (concat "anything-" name) "*"))))

 (defanything "open-files"
   ("recentf" "file-cache" "files-in-current-dir" "locate"))

 (defanything "emacs-variables"
   ("emacs-variables"))

 (defanything "emacs-functions"
   ("emacs-functions"))
