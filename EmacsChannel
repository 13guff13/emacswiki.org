== About #emacs and related channels ==

The Freenode InternetRelayChat channel '''#emacs''' is a place for a
merry get-together of all the Emacsfolks out there.  People from all
the corners of the world do populate the channel, largely from the
"West", though.  There's even a database about that, plus spiffy
graphics.  See below.

The chatter is in English and EmacsLisp, but other flavours of Lisp
and French, Finnish, German, Hindi, Portuguese, Swedish, Icelandic,
Tagalog, Persian, and who knows what else are heard from time to time.  Pour les
francophones, allez voir aussi SalleEmacsFr. Para la gente
hispanoparlante, tambiÃ©n vea CanalEmacsEs.

To catch a sneaky preview at the top-quality conversation on the
channel, take a peek at the '''fortune'''(6)-compatible archive of
EmacsChannelQuotes where some of the characters can be witnessed
uttering most fine words of wisdom for all to learn from.

After spending some time on the channel, one's mind might start
suspecting the EmacsChannelPeople are mere slackers, doing little else
than idling on their beloved channel.  The EmacsChannelDemographics
certainly proves such accusations downright rubbish.  These "slackers"
come from all aspects of life and are involved a vast range of most
Useful Things indeed.  Besides they're so busy doing their Useful
Things, they have only time to idle on the channel, and not chit-chat
all day long.  Many have even automated the joining process
(f.ex. ErcEmacsChannel), to minimize the distraction.  If the channel
does seem rather quiet at times, a gentle stir usually attracts
audience.  Be careful not to break the very few, but strict
[[EmacsChannelTabu]]s, Emacsfolks can be quite sensitive about certain
other text-editors.  This does not, repeat ''not'' spring from
insecurity while encountering derivates of '''ed'''(1), ''the standard editor''
(-> TheTruePath).

An EmacsChannelFaq is published and maintained, but frequently asked
questions are not frowned upon by channel members and are instead
answered.

Though a separate XEmacsChannel does exist, it's not to separate
Emacs-people from one another.  There's also '''#gnus''' for, well,
[[Gnus]].  EmacsChannel is a generic channel, not just for GnuEmacs.
We're all one jolly family, forget you not!

It would be naive to think only strictly Emacs-related issues were
discussed on the channel, especially on a channel where 'strict'
itself is such an unpopular idea.  At times discussions, especially
about politics, can get rather carried away as we all so well know.
It might be best to take it to the IdeologiesChannel when that
happens.  All in all, the Emacsfolks being such a well-behaved lots,
there isn't much to EmacsChannelMaintenance beyond fighting
EmacsChannelHarassment.

EmacsChannelLogging -- To log or not to log.

== Polls =

* LangPollResults -- preliminary results of the language poll on the #emacs channel

== Social Network =

Here's a graphical representation of recent conversation on the
channel:

http://www.math.tu-berlin.de/~freundt/emacs/emacs-current.png

Quite impressive, huh?

== Locations =

The following map in autogererated the data of EmacsUserLocations,
using [http://xplanet.sourceforge.net/xplanet XPlanet].

[[image:Lukhas:images/emacs-small.jpg]]

Also a [Lukhas:images/emacs-big.jpg huge (300k)] and
an [Lukhas:images/emacs-europe.jpg europe only (70k)]
versions exist.

== Law and Order =

If you need the help of a friendly *operator* (usually for kicking and banning
obnoxious fellow channel members), you can get a list of these from
fsbot. Just say:

: ops?

fsbot should reply with a list of nicks that have operator status. Usually this
wakes up some of the operators.

In the background the Freenode server maitains an *access list* for the channel.
Try it for yourself:

    /msg chanserv access #emacs list

!ChanServ will reply with a list of people who have some sort of power on the
channel. These are the important flags:

* Anybody with the +t flag may change the *topic*
* Anybody with the +o flag is a potential *operator*

The most powerful flag is the *founder* flag (+F).
Currently only [[delYsid]] has it.

If you're in trouble:

* To complain about a fellow channel member, talk to an operator (+o flag).
* To appeal decisions made by an operator, find another operator.
* If nothing else works, you'll have to contact Freenode staff on #freenode.

== Bots =

The channel is probably logged by a gazillion bots.  Some of the bots
one might encounter are described below.

In addition to addressing the bots like any other person, by prefixing
the message with the recipients nickname and a colon, the bots
understand a variety of special syntax among the traffic.  For example
BirnyTheBot considers a question mark preceding a phrase as a request
to search its database and return results to the channel.  In a
similar fashion fsbot parses strings surrounded by pairs of double
commas.

The bots generally provide help if you ask them for it.  Better do
that in private though, to keep it off the channel.

'''[::birny]'''

Commands to BirnyTheBot begin with an initial period.  Birny searches
its knowledge database for things following a question mark.

    <kensanata> .seen rms
    <birny> I've never seen rms before.

One of the most beloved commands of birny is '''.quote'''.

'''[::fsbot]'''

Fsbot, an instance of ErBot is the simplest to use.  It has pointers
to nearly all the pages on this wiki, among massive amounts of other
usefulness.  Fsbot commands start with an initial comma.  It's cunning
enough to respond to other syntaxes too.

    <kensanata> ,setfonts
    <fsbot> me thinks SetFonts is at
        http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?SetFonts

'''[::lisppaste]'''

Lisppaste is the channel's PasteBot.  Pastebots help reduce clutter on
channels, because listings of code need not be flooded onto the
channel.  A pastebot informs the channel when a paste has been added,
and if it's being annotated.  To create a new paste, go to
http://paste.lisp.org/new but of course there also an Emacs-mode to
help you in that, written by LawrenceMitchell.  It's called
<code>lisppaste.el</code> and is available from
http://purl.org/NET/wence/lisppaste.el.

'''[::specbot]'''

Specbot can look up symbols in

* "clhs", The Common Lisp HyperSpec;

* "r5rs", The Revised 5th Ed. Report on the Algorithmic Language
Scheme;

* "cocoa", Classes in the Cocoa Foundation and Application kits;

* "elisp", GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual

* "clim", Common Lisp Interface Manager II Specification;

* "ieee754", Section numbers of IEEE 754;

* "ppc", PowerPC assembly mnemonics;

* "posix", Single UNIX Specification

For instance:

     <tekai> elisp car
     <specbot> http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/elisp-manual/html_node/elisp_82.html#IDX205

'''[::rudybot]'''

[[offby1]] runs this bot in the channel. Its sole useful feature is using http://tinyurl.com to convert long URLs to short ones.  Other features, only arguably useful, include entertaining its author; spewing random quotes (mostly from jordanb) on demand; a "seen" feature similar to birny's; and a Scheme evaluator (handy for confusing Lisp novices who are unclear about the difference between Emacs Lisp and Scheme).

== Former Bots ==

These bots are no longer on #emacs:

* Somebody used to run clog to log the channel.

* Somebody used to run statbot to log the channel and derive some
statistics.  These days [[birny]] has taken over the ''seen'' function
of statbot.

* Smoke used to run f00f.  Not many people had write access to f00f,
so eventually people just fed fsbot instead of f00f.

* EdwardOConnor used to run MallowBot, an ErcRobot, in #emacs.  Fsbot
now does most of the documentation mallow used to do.

* The google-bot on #emacs used to return you a link for some search
terms.  The bot is no longer on #emacs.  Instead, fsbot now also uses
Google.

* The fsbot used to run on #emacs, now, fsbot has taken over its
functions.

----

Idea: hold tours of existing larger emacs applications for people who aren't using those apps or who would like to use them more. Sort of like a tutorial with realtime questions.

Some apps I'd like to see irc tutorials for: AdvancedDeskCalculator, EmacsCodeBrowser, BigBrotherDataBase
