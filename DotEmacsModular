EraEriksson created a simple library for keeping your DotEmacs simple
by allowing you to divide it into a modular collection of files.
It's called <tt>my-site-start</tt> and can be downloaded from http://porkmail.org/elisp

By default it will recursively load all files and directories starting from <tt>%%~/.emacs.d/site-start.d/%%</tt> but this can easily be customized to use a different directory, not recurse, etc.

The library is just a simple framework for loading a modularized set of startup files.
It does not include any functionality to actually create this modularized set of files.

As of 2009-02-05 this should be considered beta software.
