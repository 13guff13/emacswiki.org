EraEriksson created a simple library for keeping your DotEmacs simple
by allowing you to divide it into a modular collection of files.
It's called <tt>my-site-start</tt> and can be downloaded from http://porkmail.org/elisp

By default it will recursively load all files and directories starting from <tt>%%~/.emacs.d/site-start.d/%%</tt> but this can easily be customized to use a different directory, not recurse, etc.

The library is just a simple framework for loading a modularized set of startup files.
It does not include any functionality to actually create this modularized set of files.

As of 2009-02-05 this should be considered beta software.

Works well in my experience.  It echoes Debian's design for /etc/emacs/ - not sure which came first.

It's theoretically neat to be able to activate a package for personal use just by symlinking its startup file into ~/.emacs.d/site-start.d/, but I don't know of any package that uses this method of installing or
which supports soft-linking correctly in its startup file.  In order to set the load-path correctly even when visited thru a soft symlink, you can write:

(if load-file-name
   (add-to-list 
      'load-path 
      (file-name-directory (file-truename load-file-name))))

For multi-file packages, there is unfortunately no convention to indicate to the user which file is the Right File to symlink.
