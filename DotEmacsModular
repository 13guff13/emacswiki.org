EraEriksson created a simple library for keeping your DotEmacs simple
by allowing you to divide it into a modular collection of files.
It's called <tt>my-site-start</tt> and can be downloaded from http://porkmail.org/elisp

By default it will recursively load all files and directories starting from <tt>%%~/.emacs.d/site-start.d/%%</tt> but this can easily be customized to use a different directory, not recurse, etc.

The library is just a simple framework for loading a modularized set of startup files.
It does not include any functionality to actually create this modularized set of files.

As of 2009-02-05 this should be considered beta software.
The author would appreciate any comments from users;

Works well in my experience.  It echoes Debian's design for <tt>%%/etc/emacs/%%</tt> - not sure which came first.

It's theoretically neat to be able to activate a package for personal use just by symlinking its startup file into <tt>%%~/.emacs.d/site-start.d/%%</tt>, but I don't know of any package that uses this method of installing or
which supports soft-linking correctly in its startup file.  In order to set the load-path correctly even when visited thru a soft symlink, you can write:
{{{
(if load-file-name
   (add-to-list 
      'load-path 
      (file-name-directory (file-truename load-file-name))))
}}}
For multi-file packages, there is unfortunately no convention to indicate to the user which file is the Right File to symlink.

Debian already included a method like the mentioned <tt>my-site-start</tt>: It's called <tt>debian-run-directories</tt> defined in file /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/debian-startup.el in package emacsen-common. So I put in my .emacs.d/init.el

{{{
(setq dotfiles-dir (file-name-directory (or load-file-name (buffer-file-name))))

(let ((user-site-start-dir (concat dotfiles-dir "/site-start.d")))
    (debian-run-directories user-site-start-dir))
}}}
