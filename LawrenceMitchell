I use emacs (YANEU), you might be able to find me on #emacs as
[::lawrence] (see InternetRelayChat and EmacsChannelPeople).

Occasionally bits of things I write make their way into ERC. :)

You can find some stuff I've written at: 
* http://purl.org/NET/wence/emacs

And a major mode for progamming in
[http://compsoc.dur.ac.uk/whitespace/ Whitespace].

And now, for the benefit of me (when I'm not on my home box), my
Emacs init files as well:
* http://purl.org/NET/wence/init-files/
