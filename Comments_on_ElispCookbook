This page needs more cleanup.  And it should be broken up, its content moved to different pages.

I agree!

Whoa. If you do that you need an index. this is so useful in it's current form.

There already is an index: the TOC.  This page would become essentially the intro plus a list of links to what are currently the main sections, each become a separate page.  Some tiny sections could alternatively be left here.

But perhaps also some stuff here could be removed altogether, or replaced by something better, during cleanup.  One criterion should be whether material truly "demonstate[s] basic elisp programming operations in the spirit of the o'reilly cookbook series".

Anyway, I'm probably not going to be the one who cleans this up anymore or reorganizes it.  Just giving my 2 cents.  If I were a novice (or not so novice) looking for an Elisp cookbook, this would ''not'' be it (so far).  I pulled out a bit of stuff that was inappropriate, but it still needs some cleanup, IMHO. -- Drew

No, that's not an index. That's a TOC.

I often go to the cookbook page and hit Ctrl-F to find something. That's what an index would do. The TOC doesn't do the same job at all.

True, splitting the page would not allow searching all of this material together.

It's unclear to me how searching here would be very useful for the mix of topics that are here, however.  Can you give an example (hypothetical or real) of searching for something here across the sections?

I don't doubt that you have a use case, but I don't really see it yet.  There is no crying need to split the page, if there is really some good case for keeping it together.  More info, please, if possible.

Actually, you could split the content up into multiple pages A, B and C and use transclusion.

Each page would follow this pattern:

{{{
== A ==
([Self:action=edit;id=A Edit Section A])

... A!
}}}

We then replace the main page with the following:

{{{
<include "A">
<include "B">
<include "C">
}}}

The result would be:

: *A*
: (_Edit section A_)
: ... A!
: *B*
: (_Edit section B_)
: ... B!
: *C*
: (_Edit section C_)
: ... C!

The table of contents may or may not work with the included elements, I haven't tried.

Sounds interesting. I'll leave it to someone else to decide and to make the changes if decided.  Where are such things as ##([Self:action=edit;id=A Edit Section A])## documented?

A while back, I started working on splitting up this page -- '''!ElispStrings''', '''!ElispKillRegion''', '''!ElispKillLine''', '''!ElispNumbers''', '''!ElispLists''', '''!ElispVectors''', '''!ElispHashes''', '''!ElispFileOps''', '''!ElispDatesAndTimes''', '''!ElispRegularExpression''' -- but didn't finish.  I was going to keep ElispCookbook but make it an index linking to those pages.
