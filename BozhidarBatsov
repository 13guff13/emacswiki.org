== About ==

I'm a professional software engineer with a passion for UNIX and it's descendants, Emacs and free software in general. I live and work in Sofia, Bulgaria and I teach free programming and Linux courses in the universities there. I also happen to develop a couple of small OSS projects and contribute to a bunch more. I usually hang around #emacs on freenode if you need to contact me - my nicknames happens to be *bozhidar*.

== Emacs ==

I happen to maintain forks of several popular packages on GitHub. You'll also find my extensive configuration there.
