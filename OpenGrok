Ever since I started using Emacs, I was looking for ways to navigate vast multi-language source code bases. And [http://hub.opensolaris.org/bin/view/Project+opengrok/ OpenGrok] is a decent solution to this problem ("wicked fast source browser"). This package is a first attempt to make !OpenGrok available to the Emacs user.
