Lisp:w32-shell-execute.el allows you to execute any of the /Explorer verbs/ available for a file or directory.

Another simple way:

<pre>
(defun w32-dired-open-explorer ()
  "Open a file in dired mode by explorer.exe as you double click it."
  (interactive)
  (let ((file-name (dired-get-file-for-visit)))
    (if (file-exists-p file-name)
	(w32-shell-execute "open" file-name nil 1))))

;; I bind it to ``o'' in dired mode.
(require 'dired)
(define-key dired-mode-map "o" 'w32-dired-open-explorer)

</pre>
