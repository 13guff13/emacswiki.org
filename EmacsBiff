Letting you know you have new mail.

This is a very simple Emacs Biff, it supports multiple spool files and
uses less screen real estate then display-time.  Simply drop this into
your .emacs and it will show ^| (flag) on your modeline if you have
new mail.  Bugs: it assumes that your mail client empties the spool
files, which is not always true. May not work on non-unix systems.

	;; List of spool files
	(setq ebiff-spool-files-alist '("~/Mail/GnuEmacsHelp.spool"
			      "/var/spool/mail/username"))
	;; Emacs Biff
	(defun ebiff ()
	  (catch 'str
	    (dolist (spool ebiff-spool-files-alist (throw 'str ""))
	      (if (not (= (nth 7 (file-attributes (expand-file-name spool))) 0))
		  (throw 'str " ^| ")))))

	;; Add it to the modeline
	(add-to-list 'global-mode-string '(:eval (ebiff)))
