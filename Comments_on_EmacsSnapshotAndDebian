You would have thought that "build-essential" would include autotools but in Ubuntu 12, at least, it does not:

$ apt-cache depends build-essential
build-essential
 |Depends: libc6-dev
  Depends: <libc-dev>
    libc6-dev
  Depends: gcc
  Depends: g++
  Depends: make
  Depends: dpkg-dev
  Conflicts: build-essential:i386
