= Introduction =
The [http://modeemi.cs.tut.fi/~tuomov/ion/ Ion] Window Manager doesn't have overlapping windows.  All windows
are maximised inside their frame and stacked behind each other.  Like in Emacs, you
can split the screen horizontally and vertically, creating smaller
stacks.

= Keybindings =
There are nice Emacs like keybinding available for Ion, they are in the ion3 scripts repository. Direct link to the bindings configuration file: 
  
  http://modeemi.cs.tut.fi/~tuomov/repos/ion-scripts-3/keybindings/emacs_bindings.lua

= Emacs crashes with Ion =
Some people have experienced Emacs crashes when using Ion!  The
current hypothesis is that this is related to the X toolkit used.
The proposed solution when building from source:

 ./configure --with-x-toolkit=no

Using [http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/stow.html stow] (I really love it):

 mkdir -p /usr/local/stow/emacs
 make
 make install prefix=/usr/local/stow/emacs
 cd /usr/local/stow
 /usr/local/bin/stow emacs

Done.


: Is this still true? (Not the stow-HOWTO, to be sure, but that Emacs crashes when not compiled with --with-x-toolkit=no.) I've been using Emacs with Ion for more than a year now. Well, I have encountered two or three crashes, but none that I could justifiedly blame to the WM. Rather to some rather obscure things I was doing in Elisp at that time.

:: I have experienced many a crash using both the CVS version of emacs as well as the stable version, together with Ion (even wrote one or two bug reports^W^Wrants about it); seems to work now, especially with the xdefaults tweak below. I am happy. -- AndreasFuchs

: Ion users might want to put the following line in their .Xdefaults or .Xresources:

 Emacs.waitForWM: false

: Or else Emacs will wait for a response from the Window Manager on some occassions (for example when changing the default font) which it never gets from Ion.
