Emacs is also capable of using mouse strokes (also known as mouse gestures, as made popular by web browsers). Shortly it means that you forming pictograms with your mouse on the screen pressing mouse-2 and defines a function to eval when make such a gesture. Sounds complicated but it's very easy when you have seen it once....

Simply press M-x global-set-stroke, making a gesture while pressing mouse-2 and end it with mouse-3. Now you give the gesture a function to eval and that's all...

You can save you strokes with M-x save-strokes to ~/.strokes
