Sounds like a lot of overlap with CategoryCode?

It does have overlap with many things.  I had three motivations

1. To start Category pages (even redirects) for each of the official toplevel categories defined by `finder-by-keyword'. 
2. Personally uploading some very general utilities which had no reasonable Category to assign.
3. Clearly marking (for end-users) "This library won't be useful for you"

Maybe we can simply extract those elements from CategoryCode that might better fit into CategoryExtensions. If I understand the distinction correctly, everything under the "Emacs Lisp Libraries" header can be moved from Code to Extensions?
