Sounds like a lot of overlap with CategoryCode?

It does have overlap with many things.  I had three motivations

1. To start Category pages (even redirects) for each of the official toplevel categories defined by `finder-by-keyword'. 
2. Personally uploading some very general utilities which had no reasonable Category to assign.
3. Clearly marking (for end-users) "This library won't be useful for you"

Maybe we can simply extract those elements from CategoryCode that might better fit into CategoryExtensions. If I understand the distinction correctly, everything under the "Emacs Lisp Libraries" header can be moved from Code to Extensions?

Almost everything, will give it a shot.  I have to say I'm not a fan of the Emacs lingo for this distinction - "utilities" or "frameworks" would have been better choices.

This category is due to become a monster, if you fairly add links to all wiki pages that fit the description (and hopefully you at the category to each of those pages, as well).  There is so much (most?) of the wiki content that extends Emacs for programmers writing Emacs Lisp.

And the category should not be only for utility ''libraries'' that do that.  It should include also snippets that might not be in libraries -- this is a ''wiki'', after all.

I think this category -- or other categories that it greatly overlaps -- should be removed. -- DrewAdams
