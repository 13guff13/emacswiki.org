From the manual, Manual:directory-variables:

: If you put a file with a special name ##.dir-locals.el## in a
directory, Emacs will read it when it visits any file in that directory
or any of its subdirectories, and apply the settings it specifies to
the file's buffer.  Emacs searches for `.dir-locals.el' starting in the
directory of the visited file, and moving up the directory tree.

The `.dir-locals.el' file should hold a specially-constructed list.
This list maps Emacs mode names (symbols) to alists; each alist
specifies values for variables to use when the respective mode is
turned on.  The special mode name `nil' means that its alist applies to
any mode.  Instead of a mode name, you can specify a string that is a
name of a subdirectory of the project's directory; then the
corresponding alist applies to all the files in that subdirectory.

Here's an example of a `.dir-locals.el' file:

     ((nil . ((indent-tabs-mode . t)
              (tab-width . 4)
              (fill-column . 80)))
      (c-mode . ((c-file-style . "BSD")))
      (java-mode . ((c-file-style . "BSD")))
      ("src/imported"
       . ((nil . ((change-log-default-name . "ChangeLog.local"))))))
