[[fr:SectionElisp]]

This is the EmacsWiki elisp area where we collect EmacsLisp files.  No login required, no ftp required, no password required.  It's as
simple as the wiki itself.  That also means that anybody can place
malicious code in these !EmacsLisp files.  If in doubt, don't use them.

== Downloading ==

Some links to libraries show the library on a Wiki page with headers and footers. You can select the text, copy, then paste it locally. Or you can click the _Download_ link just below the page title, to see (or save) the library as plain text, without Wiki headers and footers.

Other links to libraries do not show the header and footer. You can either copy and paste the text or save the link target instead of following the link. These links are often (but not always) indicated by the prefix '''Download:'''. They always correspond to URLs that have `/download/' preceding the file name.

Besides downloading individual libraries, you can also use a *version control system* to download the files.  See WikiDownload.

=== Elisp Files - Chronological ===

=== Elisp Files - By Category ===
Most of the links off of SiteMap are to '''categories''' pages, which link to relevant user-contributed libraries

== Uploading ==

=== Files ===

Small files up to maybe 200k can be pasted into ordinary pages. Basic instructions follow but please also read and wherever possible *follow the ElispAreaConventions*.

First, create a page on the wiki explaining what the file does.  See CreateNewPages for how to do this.  On that page, create a link to the file itself using the Lisp prefix:

Example:

     Lisp:foo.el

Result:

: Lisp:foo.el

This kind of link makes it easier for visitors to download the file, and to find references to the file.

Now follow the link, edit the page, and paste the file.  When pasting, make sure the first line on the page starts with three semicolons: <code>;;;</code>.

When posting a link to the elisp file on other pages, a common practice is to also provide a link to the Wiki page(s) that describe the library, perhaps in parentheses.  See TextFormattingRules for information about how to create link to wiki page.

Example:

     Lisp:color-moccur.el (OccurBuffer)

Result:

: Lisp:color-moccur.el (OccurBuffer)

=== Large files ===

Gzip files and upload them.  Create a page to hold your file.  Use the filename as pagename, eg. color-theme.el.gz.  Edit the page, and click on the link below the save button that says to
replace the text with a file.

=== Non-Elisp packages and tarballs ===

You can store free software on [http://savannah.gnu.org/ Savannah].

=== Code snippets ===

For a small set of functions or code snippets, just
put them on the wiki pages directly, or add them to the ElispCookbook.
If you do, make sure you use the <nowiki><pre> and </pre></nowiki> or the 
<nowiki>{{{ and }}}</nowiki> tags to protect the code from formatting.

== Conventions ==

The wiki is for free software only.  Please make sure your files contain an appropriate blurb
that says so.  Code snippets are covered by the license in the footer of every page.

Please describe the EmacsLisp libraries you add to the Wiki. CreateNewPages to do that, or add the descriptions to existing pages.

Proposed guidelines for Emacs Lisp files on Emacs Wiki are in ElispAreaConventions.

== Alternatives ==

Here are some other places to download and distribute elisp code:

* [[ELPA]] -- packages included in ELPA can be installed using the package.el package manager.  The number of packages is limited but the ones that are included are of good quality.

* [[Emacsmirror]] -- a huge collection of packages which are distributed in form of [[Git]] repositories.  No support for package.el yet.
* WikifiedEmacsLispList -- pointers to various files on authors' own sites. Unfortunatly many links are dead (those that were not are also included in the Emacsmirror).
* Many pages on the %%EmacsWiki%% link to external sites with elisp libraries
* Various package hosting solutions (with version control).  Some of the more popular ones are (links to Emacs specific pages for your searching pleasure):
** Using [[Git]] --
   [http://repo.or.cz/w?a=project_list;t=emacs repo.or.cz],
   [http://gitorious.org/search?q=category:emacs gitorious],
   [http://github.com/languages/Emacs%20Lisp github]
   ([http://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitHosting more])
** Using [[Bazaar]] --
   [https://launchpad.net/+search?field.text=emacs launchpad]
** Using [[Mercurial]] --
   [http://bitbucket.org/ bitbucket]
   ([http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/MercurialHosting more])
** Various vcs --

== Tips ==

Additional tips can be found on ElispAreaDiscussions

=== Version keyword ===

If you put a percent sign (%), then "Id:" (the colon is necessary), then another %, in a page of elisp code, it will end up being expanded into a revision number and look like this:

%Id: 257%

So you can have lisp files on the wiki be version-numbered automatically instead of manually.

=== Name conflicts ===

If you find libraries that duplicate existing Emacs libraries,
consider why the code has been posted on the wiki.

# A mistake -- delete the page
# A library that was hosted on the wiki before it got integrated into Emacs -- in this case, it depends: Sometimes these copies are the last revision to actually work on older emacsen.
# A patched copy -- the page should probably be renamed.


=== Encoding ===

When pasting code on a page, make sure the code is UTF-8 encoded.
(ASCII encoding is automatically valid UTF-8!)
The wiki serves pages using a HTTP header telling browsers that the page will be UTF-8 encoded.
If your code contains Latin-1 or other encodings, this will result in garbage: Invalid UTF-8.

This usually happens when code contains string literals. Consider using octal escapes instead:

  (replace-string "\221" "`" nil (point-min) (point-max))  ; opening single quote
  (replace-string "\222" "'" nil (point-min) (point-max))  ; closing single quote

To convince yourself that octal escapes really work, consider (length "\221") -> 1.

=== Syntax highlighting ===

EmacsLisp files put on Wiki pages now have syntax highlighting in pastel colors.  The script used is the Beautifier Perl module.
