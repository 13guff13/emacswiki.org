GNU Eev provides e-script environment.

What is an e-script exactly ? Simple plain old ascii text files
holding commands (shell or not) and EmacsLisp commands (hyperlinks).

What would it be useful for ?

* replaying recorded shell "sessions"
* refering to other documents (other text files, info, man, URL, mail,
  whatever, ...)
* demoing
* insert your hint here <<----

The good thing with e-scripts is its format-independant nature
allowing them to be embedded in any file: source code (like in
litteral programming), documentations, ...

== Build a TOC for your files ==

EevMode is a great tool to build table of contents of your files.

Be sure of course to have Eev installed correctly,([http://angg.twu.net/eev-article.html]) 

if you find `eev-mode' too invasive,

(it can have some strange effect, like reverting versioned files with VC become impossible)

you can set M-e globally, like that you can use eev links even when `eev-mode' is turned off.

* set M-e Globally:

<pre>

(global-set-key (kbd "M-e") 'eek-eval-sexp-eol) 

</pre>

* Add at end of your file:

<pre>

;; Local Variables:
;; eev-comment-prefix: ";"
;; ee-anchor-format: "«%s»"
;; End:

</pre>

<u>Note</u>: `eev-comment-prefix' is the comment string you use for this file (elisp ==> %%;)%%

To make the little green glyph, turn on `eev-mode', then hit M-,

and at prompt enter < < or > >.

(Of course you set `ee-anchor-format' as you want)

<u>Now save your file, kill buffer and reopen your file.</u>

Now when you write an entry like:

;; «title-of-section» (to ".title-of-section")

You are able to write an entry in your index at beginning of file like:

;; «.title-of-section» (to "title-of-section")

To write that, just write:

;; title of section

And then hit M-, (with the cursor on the line) using this code:

* Code to tag eev entry in a file:

<pre>

(defun tv-eev-tag-entry ()
  "Tag entry in file with eev glyph"
  (interactive)
  (if (and ee-anchor-format
           eev-comment-prefix)
      (let ((entry (replace-regexp-in-string (format "^[%s ]+"
                                                     eev-comment-prefix)
                                             ""
                                             (thing-at-point 'line)))
            (new-entry))
        (setq entry (replace-regexp-in-string "\n" "" entry))
        (setq new-entry (replace-regexp-in-string " " "-" entry))
        (end-of-line)
        (re-search-backward entry)
        (delete-region (point) (line-end-position))
        (insert (concat (format ee-anchor-format new-entry)
                        " (to \"." new-entry "\")")))
      (message "Did you forget to set up ee-anchor-format and eev-comment-prefix?")))

(global-set-key (kbd "C-M-,") 'tv-eev-tag-entry)

</pre>


So on one or the over link, when you hit M-e you will move to index or your entry.

That's cool but if you have a file with hundred of lines and many entries , it will be a big work to

write an index.

* Write at the beginning of your file: (where you want your TOC)

<pre>

;; (tv-ee-index-create)

</pre>

And eval it with M-e.

It will create your index or update it if you made some changes in your file.

* Here is the code of `tv-ee-index-create':

<pre>
(defmacro *string (str num)
  "* a string with a number"
  `(let ((str-lis))
    (dotimes (n ,num)
      (push ,str str-lis))
    (mapconcat #'(lambda (i) i) str-lis "")))

(defun tv-ee-index-create ()
  "Create or update an index of all tagged entries found in file.
Put the definition of function in comment at start of index
and eval it with \"M-e\""
  (flet ((create ()
           (let ((entry-list nil)
                 (new-entry nil)
                 (start-pos)
                 (end-pos))
             (forward-line)
             (insert (concat (*string eev-comment-prefix 4)
                             (format ee-anchor-format "INDEX") "\n"))
             (setq start-pos (point))
             (while (not (eobp))
               (forward-line 1)
               (when (re-search-forward (concat (format "^%s*"
                                                        eev-comment-prefix)
                                                " *"
                                                (format ee-anchor-format ".+")) nil t)
                 (setq new-entry
                       (replace-regexp-in-string (format "%s* *" eev-comment-prefix)
                                                           ""
                                                           (match-string 0)))
                 (push new-entry entry-list)))
             (setq entry-list (reverse entry-list))
             ;; we have now a list with elmts like «elmt»
             (goto-char start-pos)
             (dolist (i entry-list)

                                        "\n")))))

<u>Note</u>: To have a nice index install http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/align.el

You should have now a file indexed like:

Lisp:AnythingConfigThierryVolpiatto.el

Have fun!
