<code>bibtex-mode</code>, contained in <code>bibtex.el</code> file, is a major mode for editing and validating [http://www.bibtex.org BibTeX] `.bib' files. It is part of GnuEmacs, and is included in [[XEmacs]]. Current <code>bibtex.el</code> maintainer is Dirk Herrmann.

!BibTeX `.bib' files contain bibliographical information. Below is an example of one entry in such `.bib' !BibTeX database file: 

    @Article{Aamport:1986a,
       author  = "L[eslie] A. Aamport",
       title   = "The Gnats and Gnus Document Preparation System",
       journal = "{G-Animal's} Journal",
       year    = "1986",
       volume  = "41",
       pages   = "73",
    }

Besides bibliographical information `.bib' files might contain definition of shortcuts used in bibliographical entries via @STRING definition, comments via @COMMENT, and code to include at the beginning of created `.bbl' bibliography file (see below) via @PREAMBLE command.

<code>bibtex(1)</code> program (command) creates a printable bibliography (`.bbl') file from references in a `.aux' file, generally written by TeX or LaTeX.  References are generated by <code>\cite</code> and <code>\nocite</code> commands or their equivalents.  The `.bbl' file is then incorporated on a subsequent TeX or LaTeX run.  The basic bibliographic information comes from `.bib' files (specified in <code>\bibliography</code> command) and a !BibTeX style (`.bst') file (specified in <code>\bibliographystyle</code> command) controls the precise contents of the `.bbl' file.

RefTeX helps with inserting citations from `.bib' !BibTeX database file in TeX or LaTeX document. Typing <code>`C-c ['</code> (`reftex-citation') will let you specify a regular expression to search in current [http://www.bibtex.org BibTeX] database files or <code>thebibliography</code> environment. The selected article is referenced as <code>\cite{</code>/key/<code>}</code> (or equivalent).

There is Lisp:bst-mode.el for editing `.bst' !BibTeX style files. !BibTeX style files are written in BAFLL (!BibTeX Anonymous Forth-Like Language). You can create your own `.bst' files using [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/custom-bib.html custom-bib] !LaTeX package, answering questions about how bibliographical entries should be formatted.

There is another !BibTeX database manager for Emacs, [[Ebib]], in early stages of development.

Another alternative for working with !BibTeX files is Nelson Beebe's [http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/emacs/bibtools.el bibtools.el]. This is an add-on to the standard <code>bibtex-mode</code> with many helper functions, which are useful when maintaining a set of `.bib' files. To use it, you will also need the files <code>bibtex-keys.el
bibtex-misc.el,
bibtex-mods.el, 
clsc.el, 
clsc20.el, 
isbn.el, 
ltxaccnt.el</code> from the [http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/emacs/ same site]. One of the many possible uses of this package is to find and eliminate duplicate entries (this is often necessary after you have merged the results from several bibliographic searches of online databases). 

bibtex.el doen't contain a good means to handle keywords. So, Bastien Guerry wrote this wonderful Lisp:bibtex-utils.el add-on when I was asking how people handle bibtex keywords on the help.gnu.emacs list. The function bibtex-make-field-keywords scans the extent keywords in a bib file and allows the user to enter keywords with auto-completion. bibtex-select-entries starts a RegExp search for all entries containing a certain keyword.

Hannes Mehnert developed a [https://github.com/hannesm/bibtex-kindle bibtex-kindle] add-on, which adds a custom field with the path to a pdf - to which title and author metadata is added - and uses keywords and journal/booktitle to create collections

One of the replacements for !BibTeX is Bibulus. It is written in Perl, and uses XML format for storing bibliographics database entries. -- http://www.nongnu.org/bibulus/

Another project which uses XML as database format is !BibTeXML. It uses Python and XSLT. -- http://bibtexml.sourceforge.net/
