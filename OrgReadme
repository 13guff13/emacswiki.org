== Using org-readme ==
Org readme is used to:

* Create/Update a "History" section in the Readme.org based on the changelog
section of the Emacs Log.
* Create/Update a "Library Information" Section Based on the Emacs lisp header.
* Create/Update a "Possible Dependencies" Section Based on the Emacs
lisp header.

All other sections of the Readme.org are then put into the
"Commentary" section of the readme.org.

In addition this library defines <tt>org-readme-sync</tt>,  a convenience function that:

* Asks for a commentary about the library change.
* Syncs the Readme.org with the lisp file as described above.
* Updates emacswiki with the library description and the library itself.
* Updates the git repository with the differences that you posted.

When <tt>org-readme-sync</tt> is called in a <tt>Readme.org</tt> file that is not a
single lisp file, the function exports the readme in !EmacsWiki format
and posts it to the !EmacsWiki.
=== EmacsWiki Page Names ===
When exporting the Readme.org to !EmacsWiki, the names are transformed
as follows:

* When the library is a single lisp function, the single lisp file is
converted to the emacswiki name by taking out the "-" and ".el" of
the library and converting to Camel Case.  For example,
org-readme.el would be converted to !OrgReadme.
* When the library is a multiple file lisp library, or a library
without any direct lisp calls, the Readme.org is converted to an
appropriate !EmacsWiki documentation file by the Parent Directory of
the <tt>Readme.org</tt>.  For example, =!EmacsPortable.App" is converted to
!EmacsPortableApp
=== Library assumptions ===
This library assumes that the Emacs Lisp libraries are created using
[http://emacswiki.org/emacs/header2.el header2.el], and optionally with the [http://emacswiki.org/emacs/lib-requires.el lib-requires.el] libraries.

== History ==

* <b>08-Aug-2012 </b> --   Fixed preformatting tags in emacswiki post. Previously they may have been replaced with <PRE></pre> instead of <pre></pre>. This makes the emacswiki page display correctly. (Matthew L. Fidler)
