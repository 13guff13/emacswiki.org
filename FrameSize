== Change Frame Size Interactively or Automatically ==

DrewAdams has written various libraries that let you resize [[frame]]s:

* <tt>[[frame-cmds.el]]</tt> lets you ''tile'' or ''maximize'' frames horizontally or vertically or both. These commands leave room for the Windows task bar and a standalone minibuffer frame, if present.

* <tt>[[fit-frame.el]]</tt> and <tt>[[autofit-frame.el]]</tt> let you ''shrink-wrap'' frames to fit their selected [[window]] ([[buffer]]) or all of their windows (buffers). 

Command `fit-frame' (usually bound to `##C-x C-_##') does this. The resulting size (just big enough to display everything, with no wrap-around or truncation) is determined
automatically, but you have control over this calculation with user variables. Alternatively, with a prefix argument, `fit-frame' prompts you for an absolute width and height. A
negative prefix argument uses the `fill-column' value for the width.

These packages also let you configure Emacs to ''automatically'' fit ''all'' frames. ##fit-frame.el## also has commands, in Windows, for maximizing and restoring a frame.


'''See Also:'''
* Libraries <tt>[[frame-cmds.el]]</tt> and <tt>[[doremi-frm.el]]</tt> have commands for ''incrementally'' resizing a frame (by using the arrow keys or mouse wheel).

* FisheyeWithThumbs for commands to temporarily shrink frames to thumbnail size.


== Set Frame Size Programmatically ==

You can use any of the commands and Lisp functions that work interactively (see [[#ChangeInteractively]]) to set the frame size in Lisp, of course.

You can also set the default frame size at startup. The EmacsManual (`C-h r') has a good presentation about frame parameters (##geometry## etc.)


=== geometry ===

Use the ##-geometry## command line option, e.g., ##-geometry 80x24## will
start Emacs at 80 characters wide by 24 characters high.

On MS Windows systems, create a shortcut to start emacs, open its property
sheet, and add the command line option to the "Target" field.

On Windows systems, if you want to startup with Emacs maximised, you can
do so by adding the following to your [[init file]]

    (w32-send-sys-command #xf030)

[new]
Note, I (LawrenceMitchell) find that this doesn't always work perfectly,
it's best if you have this right at the end of your init file, after everything
else has been loaded.

: Why not use `after-init-hook'? -- EdwardOConnor

=== default-frame-alist ===

Also see the documentation of [[option]] `default-frame-alist'. You can [[Customize]] this variable  to specify the frame width and height you want (in characters).

Or you can do this in your [[init file]]:

    (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(height . 24))
    (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(width . 80))


=== making the changes persistent across sessions ===

Lisp:frame-restore.el is a mess.  Just use this instead:
<pre>
(add-hook 'after-init-hook '(lambda () (w32-send-sys-command ?\xf030)))
</pre>
-- PatrickAnderson

=== X resources ===

Under X, simply use X resources to define defaults for Emacs (or any
other program). The exact mechanisms for this differ, but generally,
you have your X session run xrdb on some file in your home directory,
which is where you'd store your defaults. Common names for this file
are .Xresources (this is basically standard on newer computers) and
.Xdefaults (think 1991-ish). -- EraEriksson

Here's an example for your ~/.Xresources (or .Xdefaults):

    Emacs*geometry:     80x24
