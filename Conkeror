Conkeror is a Mozilla based web browser whose design is largely inspired by Emacs, notwithstanding a few unique
features of its own for dealing with those problems unique to the domain of gui web browsing.  It embraces a
prime directive to make every aspect of web browsing available via keyboard control.  For more information,

If you are not using any of the standard window managers in Linux then you may be required to set Conkeror as your default browser manually.
