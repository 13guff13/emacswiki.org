Hi, I am Memnon. Contact me at gegendosenfleisch@gmail.com.

=Who am I?=
Obviously an emacs user, but, as it seems, of a rather rare breed. 
I am no programmer. Nevertheless, I use emacs more and more.

I use it for

* Organizing (OrgMode)
* Mail, News, RSS (Gnus) 
* Writing (Latex)
* Irc, IM (Erc with Bitlbee)
* Dealing with files (Dired)
* Editing this wiki (YaoddMuse)
* Browsing the web (EmacsW3m, conkeror alternatively)

Most resources stress how great emacs is for programming. Only few stress, that it is great
for everything related to text. I think emacs is great for _everyone_ who uses computers
extensively. Sadly enough, it takes some time (and effort) to appreciate the power emacs
offers in **every** text related task. Yes, tailoring emacs to your needs takes some effort.
My advice: Start slowly! I started with OrgMode; only OrgMode. Very quickly, I went through
the pain configuring Gnus. Then, I heard AUCTeX is great for Latex, so I started using that, too.
And that was it for several month! But soon, writing my mails and organizing my life into OrgMode
files, I discovered the advantage of "One Interface to do the Job", i.e. Text editing.
I used ispell to check my texts, then added FlySpell to my repertoire of tools.
I started to use DictEm to let emacs show me quickly the meaning of unknown words.
(I distinctly remember the moment: I read the word 'plethora' [http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/gnus/Select-Methods.html here] ;).)
And these are features available **all the time**: In your mails, in IRC/IM, editing any kind of text ... 
if you use emacs ;). 

Now, after more than a year, I feel like I only start to grasp what this means for my relationship
to computers and userinterfaces: It feels like - after my first contact with MS Dos 5.0 at the age of 13 - for the first
time I see computers and the possibilities they are offering from a completely different POV.  
(Or maybe the second time: Win 95 and the concept of everything is a Gui was a profound paradigm shift, too of course).
So, if you are an avid computer user, but alas without any "coding" skills, I want to encourage you: 
**Have no fear! It //is// worth it.**

=.emacs=
I just added some more lines to my .emacs when I suddenly realized
it is not that small anymore ;). I learned from alle the init files 
out there, so [http://memnon.sdf-eu.org/emacs.org here (.org)] and [http://memnon.sdf-eu.org/emacs.html here (.html)] is mine.
It definately lacks more comments ... I'll add them when I will find the time.

=My favorites=

I really need to get some structure into this page, but "release early, release often", I
add links to (imho) the best features/addons/whatever for emacs.

* OrgMode
* [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CategoryGnus Gnus]]
* [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Anything Anything]]
* DiredMode
* KeyboardMacros
* [http://www.shellarchive.co.uk/2009-03-08-lessen-a-url-with-smallurl-el.html SmallUrl] (Transform url via tinyurl. Trivial, but I use it all the time ;)
* [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4125/ It's all text]: Edit any textinput in Firefox/Conkeror within an emacslient frame.
