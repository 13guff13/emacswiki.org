Hi, I am Memnon. Contact me at gegendosenfleisch@gmail.com.

I just added some more lines to my .emacs when I suddenly realized
it is not that small anymore ;). I learned from alle the init files 
out there, so [http://memnon.sdf-eu.org/.emacs here] is mine. Definately needs some clean up,
but a working copy of what I use everyday.
