[[Gyom]] I used  to  have  M-0, M-+  and  M-- bound  to
ordinary 'text-scale-adjust'  commands,   but  I  found  it  quite
annoying  to  have  to  zoom  in  *each*  buffer  separately.  This
globalized-mode hack is not very elegant, but it works fo me.

Note  that using,  at the  same  time, commands  from the  original
text-scale-mode  and  from  this  globalized  mode  yields  strange
results due to  the way buffer-local variables are  handled. What we
would need  here is a way to  *undo* the make-variable-buffer-local
statement of face-remap.el, in order for the  adjustments to be properly perceived by
everyone, but I don't know how to get that at all.

Until then, this globalized version will be just fine for me !

 
  (define-globalized-minor-mode 
    global-text-scale-mode
    text-scale-mode
    (lambda () (text-scale-mode 1)))
  
  (defun global-text-scale-adjust (inc) (interactive)
    (text-scale-set 1)
    (kill-local-variable 'text-scale-mode-amount)
    (setq-default text-scale-mode-amount (+ text-scale-mode-amount inc))
    (global-text-scale-mode 1)
  )

  (global-set-key (kbd "M-0")
                  '(lambda () (interactive)
                     (global-text-scale-adjust (- text-scale-mode-amount))
                     (global-text-scale-mode -1)))
  (global-set-key (kbd "M-+")
                  '(lambda () (interactive) (global-text-scale-adjust 1)))
  (global-set-key (kbd "M--")
                  '(lambda () (interactive) (global-text-scale-adjust -1)))
  

---A better way to get the same effect.---

A far better way to get the same effect add to your init file something like:
{{{
(add-to-list 'face-remapping-alist '(default (:height 1.15) default))
}}}

This makes the size of the default font larger;  I assume that's what you want
since you talk of zooming each buffer separately.  Firstly your code confuses
some major modes, Notmuch Hello mode being an example.  Secondly you can tune the
resizing to exactly what you want.  Thirdly you won't normally have to bother
about zooming at all because Emacs will start up with the font size you want.
And, of course, you won't get the strange effects you talk about.

I hope you find this helpful. --- [[Bernard Hurley]]
