[[Gyom]] I used  to  have  M-0, M-+  and  M-- bound  to
ordinary 'text-scale-adjust'  commands,   but  I  found  it  quite
annoying  to  have  to  zoom  in  *each*  buffer  separately.  This
globalized-mode hack is not very elegant, but it works fo me.

Note  that using,  at the  same  time, commands  from the  original
text-scale-mode  and  from  this  globalized  mode  yields  strange
results due to  the way buffer-local variables are  handled. What we
would need  here is a way to  *undo* the make-variable-buffer-local
statement of face-remap.el, in order for the  adjustments to be properly perceived by
everyone, but I don't know how to get that at all.

Until then, this globalized version will be just fine for me !

  (define-globalized-minor-mode 
    global-text-scale-mode
    text-scale-mode
    (lambda () (text-scale-mode 1)))
  
  (defun global-text-scale-adjust (inc) (interactive)
    (kill-local-variable 'text-scale-mode-amount)
    (setq-default text-scale-mode-amount (+ text-scale-mode-amount inc))
    (global-text-scale-mode 1)
  )
  
  (global-set-key (kbd "M-0")
                  '(lambda () (interactive)
                     (global-text-scale-adjust (- text-scale-mode-amount))
                     (global-text-scale-mode -1)))
  (global-set-key (kbd "M-+")
                  '(lambda () (interactive) (global-text-scale-adjust 1)))
  (global-set-key (kbd "M--")
                  '(lambda () (interactive) (global-text-scale-adjust -1)))
