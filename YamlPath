<code>yaml-path.el</code> provides a function to display an xpath-like string for the yaml element on the current line. It's meant to complement Yoshiki Kurihara's YamlMode.

Get it at http://alpheus.me/src/emacs/yaml-path/yaml-path.el

<code>yaml-path.el</code> doesn't strictly depend on yaml-mode, but works better with yaml-mode.  (That's because yaml-mode makes syntax-ppss usable for locating comments.)

The only function you should need is yaml-path/path. It's convenient to bind that to a key, e.g. C-c C-p.
