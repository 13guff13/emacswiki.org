=== Who I am ===

Just a dude who happens to love this wonderful editor.

=== Home-made ===

I use GNU Emacs on GNU/Linux and Windows and I have done some small elisp hacks myself:

* WThirtyTwoNetSend - send multiple net messages to multiple users (>Windows NT 4)
* MakeSmartShortcuts - helping utility to organize your Start Menu in a clever way
* HideRegion - hide regions of text in a buffer regardless of mode etc
* WThirtyTwoMsgBox
* FileProps - manage file properties
* [[Tumme]] - included in Emacs 22.1 as `image-dired'
* [[gds]] - Emacs interface to Google Desktop Search
* [[VLF]] - View larger files than Emacs normally can. Kind of works, maybe...

I also use OddMuse at home (mostly as an experiment): http://klibb.com/wiki
