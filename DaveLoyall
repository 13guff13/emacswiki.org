I use emacs.

= Init =
I use [https://github.com/eschulte/emacs24-starter-kit https://github.com/eschulte/emacs24-starter-kit], only lightly modified.  I also use [https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs].

I use Debian's emacs24, and I always prefer to get everything from one of the ELPA sites.
