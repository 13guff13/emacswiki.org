I wanted to use the 'dynamic symbol with my linum-format but I also wanted a vertical bar separator between the linum and my code.  I took a look at what dynamic does and just added the following to my .emacs file and it works great.
(setq linum-format (propertize (format " %%%dd \u2502" (length (number-to-string (count-lines (point-min) (point-max)))))))

Add your comment here.
your patch to display last line num doesn't work.

I tried [tt]linum[/tt], [tt]nlinim[/tt] and [tt]lineno[/tt] on the sqlite-amalgamation file (5MB, 148784 lines). [tt]lineno[\tt] is the only one to be usable on my machine (3.5 GHz Intel Core 7)
