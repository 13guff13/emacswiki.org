The InterMap lists the *Manual* prefix which runs the [http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/info-ref info-ref] script. Note the source link at the bottom of that page. You'll note that I have to manually add URLs for manuals to slurp. Any suggestions? I noted the comment in the CategoryEshell history. :) -- AlexSchroeder

Great script, Alex!

Some suggestions:

* Auctex
* Autotype
* Calc
* Dired-x
* Info
* Ediff
* Texinfo -- Has an Emacs section
* URL

Maybe some general GNU manuals?:

* Coreutils
* Diffutils
* Findutils

Maybe Make, Bash and Coding standards.  Now I'm just being silly.
