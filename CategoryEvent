We record Emacs events, meet ups, swarms, soirees, booze ups, piss ups, bondage sessions and other collections on this page.

== Upcoming Events ==

People (those who went to the Emacs Conference and some IRC people who wish they had) are trying to setup a regular user group or Swarm. We'll record information (at least) here if we manage that.

== Past Events ==

[[Emacs_Conference_2013]] was a conference in London for Emacs hackers and users.
