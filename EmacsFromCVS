== Quick Start ==
If you just want the latest EMACS from CVS, use this:

 cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.savannah.gnu.org:/cvsroot/emacs co emacs

==Description==

This page describes how to acquire a development version of GnuEmacs
from the official CVS source code repository on Savannah.  
Needless to say, any
development version is the bleeding edge, the effective word being
"bleeding".

The Emacs Savannah project page is at the URI:

* http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/Emacs

Of course some sort of a CVS client is required.  Mainly the use of
the Berliner, Zuhn and Polk command-line CVS client from GNU is
described here for now.  Of course other CVS programs exists, as do
interfaces to the GNU CVS.

The way to get the sources from Savannah changed 2005-12-11, see http://savannah.gnu.org/forum/forum.php?forum_id=4168.
Look at the project page above for specific information about how to get Emacs sources.

== Code ==
I think it is better to tell where the relevant information is.
In the files you download from CVS you can find the files INSTALL, INSTALL.CVS and nt\INSTALL (for MS Windows) that describes how to 
build Emacs.
You can look at those files in the [http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html#Obtaining Emacs CVS Repository] without checking out
all the code for Emacs.

The process of building Emacs is well described for *nix style operating systems.
The description you give below is not entirely cross platform since it does not work for MS Windows.
I believe it is easy to build on those system and quite a bit more complicated to get started on MS Windows.
I have therefore written a simple version about that in the documentation for [[EmacsW32]].

{{{
#! /bin/sh
## Minimal best-practices cross-platform build from current CVS

## install optional support libraries (especially for fuller image support)

## icons installed separately?

cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.savannah.gnu.org:/cvsroot/emacs co emacs
cd emacs

./configure
make bootstrap

make
make install

## suggest help URLs or packages
## code to dump?
}}}

==Getting the sources from CVS==

Follow the instructions in Emacs project page above to check out the sources.

After the code has been fetched the first time, the command <code>cvs
update</code> ''modulename'' will check if any of the revisions on the
repository have changed, and will bring the local copies to match if
any have.

One can of course check out historical sets too.  This is achieved
with the '-r' switch to CVS's '''checkout''' alias '''co''' command.
This could be useful for example if one wishes to get a set of the
sourcecode considered to be reasonably well-behaved and stable.  The
following command demonstrates this, and downgrades to the latest
Emacs 21 pre-release.

    cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.savannah.gnu.org:/cvsroot/emacs co -rEMACS_21_1_RC emacs

See http://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group_id=40 for more details.

== Branches and Tags ==

The following commands, executed in the top-level emacs directory, will extract
a list of branches in approximately most-to-least recent order:

  cvs status -v > emacs.branches;
  perl -n \
    -e '$x && /\S/ &&'                                                       \
    -e 'do { /(\S+)\s+\(\S+: (\S+)\)/; if( $2 gt $s{$1} ) { $s{$1} = $2} };' \
    -e '$x = $x ? !/^\s*$/ : /^\s+Existing Tags:\s*$/i;'                     \
    -e 'END { map {printf(STDOUT "%-14s: %s\n", $s{$_}, $_)} keys( %s ) }'   \
      emacs.branches |\
        sort -r | uniq

The top few branches are currently:

  3.94        : emacs-unicode-2-base
  3.94        : EMACS_PRETEST_22_0_93
  3.93        : EMACS_PRETEST_22_0_92
  3.93        : EMACS_PRETEST_22_0_91
  3.93        : EMACS_PRETEST_22_0_90
  3.9.8       : gerd_int
  3.9.6       : gerd_dbe
  3.9.4       : lexbind
  3.9.4       : gerd_defvaralias
  3.9.4       : Boehm-GC
  3.9.2       : rmail-mbox-branch
  3.9.2       : fx-branch
  3.9.2       : emacs-unicode
  3.9.10      : gerd_big
  3.9         : fx-branch-base
  3.9         : emacs-unicode-base

==MS Windows Specific Information==
On MS Windows without Cygwin the process is a little, little bit different.
Information about this is available if you follow the links on [[EmacsW32]].

==Alternatives to CVS==

While Emacs is still developed in CVS some mirrors exist that allow you to checkout and hack on Emacs using your favorite version control system. Specific information can be found at EmacsFromBazaar, EmacsFromGit, EmacsFromMercurial, and EmacsFromArch.

Note that [[Bazaar]] is said to be the vcs to be used for Emacs development in the future.

==Router port required by CVS==
... and don't forget to open the port 2401 on your router, it is required by CVS.

== Distribution-Specific Instructions for GNU/Linux ==

For building on Debian GNU/Linux, see EmacsCvsAndDebian.  For building on Slackware Linux, see [http://slackwiki.org/Emacs_from_CVS SlackWiki].
