I recently got a question from a user by email regarding these green links and the creating of local copies of these remote pages.
I finally decided that these near pages provided a minuscule benefit and a somewhat rare drawback – in short, they weren't worth keeping.

If the NearMap must go it is probably because it included a moribund group of Wikis.  At one time Meatball and Community Wiki held promise.  What if it included WardsWiki (the WikiWiki) or the related Wikis on the InterMap or the WikiNode?

This feature might still be useful.
