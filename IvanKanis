I am Ivan [http://kanis.fr Kanis]

I have used emacs since around 1997, my wife worked at Amazon and I got her the O'Reilly book. She didn't need it anymore so I used it and have used emacs since. In 2002 I got more proficient with elisp. 

In 2007, I have declared .emacs bankruptcy like [http://www.emacsblog.org/2007/10/07/declaring-emacs-bankruptcy/ Ryan McGeary]. My configuration file grew so large it was unmaintainable. I took the time to split it up in small manageable chunks.

The [http://kanis.fr/hg/lisp/ result] was well worth the time invested. I have packaged all external programs that are not included in emacs 23.1: auctex, bbdb, lookup, org, w3m...

The start up files are in [http://kanis.fr/hg/lisp/emacs.d emacs.d]. I have split files amongst different functionality groups. I compile all elisp files myself. A warning message will help me find my mistakes

I wrote the mercurial backend and a world clock that are now part of emacs. I have also written a NewTerminal called nterm.

I have patched appt.el to support variable warning time see details on my [http://kanis.fr/blog-emacs.html blog].
