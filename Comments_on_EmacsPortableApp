This page is HUGE.

tl;dr: could we break it up?

Yes, there ARE other HUGE pages in this wiki. I also find them unnavigable.

And, yes, if I think it should be broken up, I could take that upon myself, I'm not asking someone else to do the labor.
I just don't want to do it and see it reverted a day later.
