There is some description of linux keys in LoadKeys and MissingKeys.

What this document describes is how to add keys to the linux console,
that linux knows nothing about ;) 

If you run the program dumpkeys, it will display your current keyboard
configuration -- probably in a format that you don't understand. 

I personally configured my keyboard to use the meta keys as meta.
They look like &lt;&gt; (a diamond) so I changed my entire configuration a
lot.

I still use A-Fn to switch between VTs so I wanted M-Fn to produce
something I could use in emacs.

Linux does now know anything about a meta key, but it has eight
control keys, so I used shiftl to represend meta.

So here is my configuration for F1:

<pre>
keycode  59 = F1               F1               Console_13       F1              
	alt	keycode  59 = Console_1       
	control	alt	keycode  59 = Console_1       
	shiftl keycode 59 = F41 # Emacs Meta F1
</pre>

The first line says that key with code 65 (F1) is F1 (the following
&quot;F1 Console_13 F1&quot; doesn't matter, really).  The next line says that
A-F1 is VT 1 and the third says that C-A-F1 is VT 1.  On the other
hand the fourth line says that M-F1 is F41.

My meta keys return codes 124 and 126 (left and right), so I bound
them to shiftl and used that as meta:

<pre>
keycode 124 = ShiftL
keycode 126 = ShiftL
</pre>

Now, linux configures the Fn keys to be a string, and there is a
default string for F1 - F20, as so:

<pre>
string F1 = "\033[[A"
	:
	:
string F20 = "\033[34~"
</pre>

What I did was to create a string for M-Fn, and bind that to other Fn
keys, and I started with F41, so I could just add 40 to the F number
to get meta Fn:

<pre>
string F41 = "\033[\033[[A"	# Emacs Meta F1
string F42 = "\033[\033[[B"	# Emacs Meta F2
string F43 = "\033[\033[[C"	# Emacs Meta F3
string F44 = "\033[\033[[D"	# Emacs Meta F4
string F45 = "\033[\033[[E"	# Emacs Meta F5
string F46 = "\033[\033[17~"	# Emacs Meta F6
string F47 = "\033[\033[18~"	# Emacs Meta F7
string F48 = "\033[\033[19~"	# Emacs Meta F8
string F49 = "\033[\033[20~"	# Emacs Meta F9
string F50 = "\033[\033[21~"	# Emacs Meta F10
string F51 = "\033[\033[23~"	# Emacs Meta F11
string F52 = "\033[\033[24~"	# Emacs Meta F12
</pre>

These are strings I chose, so you don't have to use the same strings,
just be careful not to use strings that conflict with anything else.

Emacs can then be configured to treat these strings as a key or
keybinding, such as M-Fn.


==Using Windows Keys As Hyper Key==

An obscure feature of Emacs can be used to get even more keys on
the console -- I use this to turn the windows keys on my keyboard
into Hyper and Super  [[modifier key]]s.

Here is the trick:

basically, if you hit C-h c followed by C-x@ha you will see that
emacs knows that as a key prefix. 
In fact the above is hyper-a to emacs. similarly, you can prouce
all the other modifiers as shown in the list below with C-x@ as
the common prefix:

* a alt
* c control
* h hyper
* m meta
*s shift
* S super

In fact the above is part of the raw keyboard translation and is
meant for use in environments where the keyboard is incapable of
producing the appropriate modifier bit.

So using all that has been said on this thread so far plus the
above, you can get *many* more keys on your emacs keyboard!

I'm typing this on an 88 key hackers wireless keyboard, and in
addition to the windows keys being hyper and super modifiers
respectively, 
I also have the following:

* c-: hyper
* c-' super
*c-, alt
     * c-. super

(note that alt above is different and distinct from meta.
