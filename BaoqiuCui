== About Me and This Page ==

This is the page for Baoqiu Cui.  I have used both Emacs and XEmacs:
started with Emacs, switched to XEmacs (while XEmacs was having more
features than Emacs) and stayed there for many years, but finally
switched back to Emacs in 2008.

I started using Emacs around 1995-1996, and I got addicted to it very
quickly.  Nowadays I find it very hard to use any computer that does not
have Emacs installed. :-) Many thanks to all the people who contributed
/ are contributing to Emacs (many of them can be found on EmacsWiki),
my daily life and work becomes very interesting.

Almost everything I regularly do on a computer is done in Emacs:

* programming (for //all// kinds of programming languages)
* authoring (LaTeX, DocBook, HTML, XML, plain text, etc.)
* reading documents (Texinfo, man pages, PDF files, etc.)
* using version controls (RCS, CVS, SVN, GIT, CMVC)
* reading/composing emails
* taking notes
* spell checking
* grammar checking
* calculation
* looking up words in dictionaries
* managing TODO lists
* managing file systems
* managing address book
* IRC
* IM
* reading newsgroups
* browsing webs
* twittering
* playing games (sometimes :-) )
* ...

To me, Emacs is a the editor for programmers; whatever you want to do on
a computer (i.e. in Emacs), you can always write or modify some existing
Emacs Lisp code to make it happen.  For most of the times, what you want
to do is already done by someone somewhere on the internet.  Thanks to
EmacsWiki, searching for the things you need becomes very convenient.

I hope I can share things that are worth sharing with people.  Comments
and feedbacks are welcome.

== Packages ==

Welcome to the wiki! -- AlexSchroeder

Thanks for the wonderful work of EmacsWiki, AlexSchroeder!  -- BaoqiuCui

Welcome to the wiki! I think grammar checking is one area Emacs has no good solution and your project can be a valuable addition to Emacs. Have you considered posting your project info to emacs-devel and ask for their comments to include it when it's matured? -- [[Leo]]

Thanks for the comments!  I am planning to post a message on emacs-devel
and/or comp.emacs to get people's input once this project gets more
matured.  (Thought that EmacsWiki is a better place to get some early
comments... and turned out I was right. :-)  -- BaoqiuCui
