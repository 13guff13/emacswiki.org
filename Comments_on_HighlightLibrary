Hello,
I installed this nice library from MELPA.

After nothing else but  

     M-x: hlt-highlight-region
the region gets highlighted but then, when simply moving the point around, the following error message is posted:

     Invalid face color [4 times]
The error count goes up the more you move the point in that buffer.

After: 

     M-x: hlt-unhighlight-region
the error posting stops and the highlight goes away, as expected.

I have turned off any other extension or theme but the above procedure still reproduces the problem.

I am using a fairly recent emacs

    GNU Emacs 24.5.50.1 (x86_64-apple-darwin14.4.0, NS apple-appkit-1348.17) of 2015-08-08
yet, never had any problems with faces.

Would be nice, if this issue could be tracked down.
