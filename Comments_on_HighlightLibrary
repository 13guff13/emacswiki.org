Is it possible to highlight the characters in a line when the cursor is hovering over that line?

Do you mean highlight the line under the mouse pointer?

You can do that using library `highlight.el` by putting property `mouse-face` on the line, either as a text property or as an overlay.  That is, you use property `mouse-face` instead of property `face`.

And in fact there is a command for this: **`hlt-mouse-face-each-line`**. It makes each line in the region highlighted when you hover the mouse over that line.

With a prefix arg it prompts you for the highlighting face to use. Use `C-h f hlt-mouse-face-each-line` for more info.
