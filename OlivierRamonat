I'm a Software Engineer and I develop in my free time Free Software mainly in Ada.

I use GNU Emacs for almost everything including reading mails (with gnus) or chatting (with emacs-jabber)

I have written [[require-or-install.el]] see [http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gnu-emacs-sources/2007-09/msg00044.html]

Bienvenue sur le wiki !! 
If you don't allready know this pages have a look at  [[InstallElisp]] [[InstallingPackages]] [[ELPA]]
which I think are somehow related  to your require-or-install.el.
