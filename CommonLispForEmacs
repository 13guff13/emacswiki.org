Some CommonLisp functions and macros can be used in EmacsLisp programs.

It is already loaded when you start XEmacs.  For GNU Emacs, you need to add the following to your ~/.emacs file:

    (require 'cl)

There is a separate InfoMode manual for this package.  See Info node (cl).  Some
aspects of EmacsLisp can't be changed or emulated transparently: you
don't get packages, you don't get lexical scoping unless you
ask for it with `lexical-let', you don't get keyword arguments unless
you define your function with `defun*' and so on.  See the Info node
(cl)Common Lisp Compatibility.

Here are some things extending <code>cl.el</code>,

* ArrayExtension -- for <code>cl-array.el</code> multi-dimensional arrays
* struct+.el / defstruct+.el -- enhancing <code>defstruct</code> (gone?)
* [http://user42.tuxfamily.org/cl-loop-aplist/index.html cl-loop-aplist.el] -- <code>loop</code> over alists and plists
* If you want to highlighting cl functions for coding conventions, you
can use Lisp:highlight-cl.el package.

Packages distributed within GNU Emacs don't use cl at runtime (on account of its size, and potential future namespace clashes), only via byte-compiled macros (see the introduction to the cl manual on this).[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-09/msg01472.html]  That doesn't mean you must avoid cl altogether if you aspire to get code into Emacs, indeed major packages like CcMode and [[Gnus]] happily use cl; just ensure it's only through macro forms (such as `push', `setf', `defun*', `loop').  The easiest way to do that is

  (eval-when-compile (require 'cl))

instead of
  
  (require 'cl)

The <code>eval-when-compile</code> gets cl loaded when compiling, and the macros expand at that time, leaving no reference to cl in the <code>.elc</code> (if only macros forms are used).  If running uncompiled cl is loaded, but that's ok since there are currently no technical issues.

EmacsCommonLisp is (or will soon be) a full implementation of CommonLisp.

CL's main entry is (require 'cl-lib) since GNU Emacs 24.3. -- XueFuqiao
