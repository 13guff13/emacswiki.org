WhichFuncMode (also known as [::WhichFunctionMode]) is a minor mode, that when activated displays the current function name in the mode line. It works under certain major modes, like c-mode or perl-mode. 
To activate it, type

  M-x which-func-mode RET

or enter the following piece of elisp into your `.emacs` file to make it permanent :

  (which-func-mode 1)

== Troubleshooting ==

WhichFuncMode is based on ImenuMode, so if it doesn't show correct current function name (and mode supports imenu), try

  M-x imenu RET *Rescan* RET
  C-g

which does

{{{
(progn
  (imenu--cleanup)
  (setq imenu--index-alist nil)
  (imenu-update-menubar))
}}}

== Displayed in header-line ==

To show the function in the HeaderLine instead of the ModeLine,

{{{
(load "which-func")
(which-func-mode)

(delete (assoc 'which-func-mode mode-line-format) mode-line-format)
(setq which-func-header-line-format
              '(which-func-mode
                ("" which-func-format
                 )))
(defadvice which-func-ff-hook (after header-line activate)
  (when which-func-mode
    (delete (assoc 'which-func-mode mode-line-format) mode-line-format)
    (setq header-line-format which-func-header-line-format)))

}}}

== Other langauges ==

To get other languages to work with which-func, simple add the name of a programing mode with support for Imenu to `which-func-modes'.

  (eval-after-load "which-func"
    (unless  (member java-mode which-func-modes)
      (add-to-list 'which-func-modes 'java-mode)))

Thanks for the tip, yet should this not be more like (e.g. for lua-mode)?

  (eval-after-load "which-func"
    (unless (member 'lua-mode which-func-modes)
      (add-to-list 'which-func-modes 'lua-mode)))

Yes, or just

  (eval-after-load "which-func"
      (add-to-list 'which-func-modes 'lua-mode))

Good point about add-to-list.  I found that the following seems to work even better here (otherwise leading to startup errors):

  (eval-after-load "which-func"
      '(add-to-list 'which-func-modes 'lua-mode))

Ah yes, of course, forgot to quote the form.
Please clean up this discussion and just show the valid form.

To configure a language for which-func mode, you need to configure it for Imenu.  See ImenuMode.

== Alternatives ==

An alternative mode that offers similar functionality for several programming languages is SemanticIdleBreadcrumbsMode.

Suggestion: might someone with the required knowledge like to compare and contrast [[WhichFuncMode]] with [[ElDoc]]? Are they (should they be) mutually incompatible?

[new]
As far as I can see they are rather orthogonal.
WhichFuncMode shows which function's source code you are in.
ElDoc shows where you are in a parameter list to a function call.
