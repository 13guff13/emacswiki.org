WhichFuncMode (also known as [::WhichFunctionMode]) is a minor mode, that when activated displays the current function name in the mode line. It works under certain major modes, like CcMode or PerlMode. 
To activate it, type

  M-x which-function-mode RET

or enter the following piece of elisp into your `.emacs` file to make it permanent :

  (which-function-mode 1)

WhichFuncMode is based on ImenuMode, so if it doesn't show correct current function name (and mode supports imenu), try

  M-x imenu RET *Rescan* RET RET

To show the function in the HeaderLine instead of the ModeLine,

{{{
(which-function-mode)

(delete (assoc 'which-func-mode mode-line-format) mode-line-format)
(setq which-func-header-line-format
              '(which-func-mode ("" which-func-format)))
(defadvice which-func-ff-hook (after header-line activate)
  (when which-func-mode
    (delete (assoc 'which-func-mode mode-line-format) mode-line-format)
    (setq header-line-format which-func-header-line-format)))

}}}

To get other languages to work with which-func, simple add the name of a programing mode with support for Imenu to `which-func-modes'.

  (eval-after-load "which-func"
      '(add-to-list 'which-func-modes 'java-mode))

To configure a language for which-func mode, you need to configure it for ImenuMode.

WhichFuncMode shows which function's source code you are in, ElDoc shows where you are in a parameter list to a function call.  They both are mode-configurable.

== Alternatives ==

An alternative mode that offers similar functionality for several programming languages is SemanticIdleBreadcrumbsMode.

Another alternative mode is [http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gnu-emacs-sources/2011-01/msg00006.html cfm]. Cfm (display current function or method) will display class-qualified member function names (A::foo), particularly useful for C++ and Java classes that embed member function definitions (that is, without the three-box model).
