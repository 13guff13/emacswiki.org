This page is about library '''[::Wide-N]''', <tt>[[wide-n.el]]</tt>, which lets you browse among multiple buffer restrictions (narrowings).

== A Ring of Narrowings ==

Library '''Wide-N''' advises `narrow-to-region', the basic narrowing command, so that each time you narrow a buffer the narrowing is recorded in a buffer-local ring. You can return to any of these buffer restrictions selectively anytime.

'''`C-x n x'''' is bound to command `wide-n-repeat', which is just a repeatable version of command `wide-n'. It restores the last recorded narrowing for the current buffer.

The narrowings can be nested, but they need not be. They can be any [[region]]s at all.

* You can repeat the `x' to cycle quickly among narrowings: `C-x n x x x'...

* You can go directly to the Nth previous narrowing by using a positive [[numeric prefix argument]]. (This is the '''N''' in '''Wide-N'''.)

* You can widen the buffer completely by using a plain prefix arg (`C-u') or a negative prefix arg (`C--').  A negative prefix arg also resets (empties) the ring for the current buffer.

* The whole buffer (widened completely) is also at the end of the ring, so you can cycle to it.

* You can also use `C-x n w' (standard command `widen') to widen the buffer completely, as usual.
