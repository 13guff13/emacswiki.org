From the [http://www.dur.ac.uk/p.j.heslin/Software/Emacs/Easymacs/ Web page]:


: Easymacs is an easy-to-learn, one-size-fits-all configuration for new users of GNU Emacs. It sets up key bindings that conform to a common denominator of the Gnome/KDE/OS X/Microsoft Windows human interface guidelines, and provides function-key bindings for other powerful Emacs features. It is fully documented, and the new user can productively edit text right away, without going through the Emacs tutorial. Many commonly-used functions can be accessed without having to learn the "chords", or multiple keystrokes that Emacs uses by default.

: Easymacs was designed with the non-programmer in mind, someone who would like to use Emacs to edit mainly text files, especially LaTeX and TEI-conforming XML. Since many aspects of the configuration of Emacs require a certain knowledge of programming, this sort of person might find the default behavior of Emacs too foreign and too hard to reconfigure.

It may not be approprate for readers of Emacswiki, most of whom I suspect are comfortable with configuring Emacs for themselves.  It may, however, be a package you can recommend to friends, family and colleagues who would like to use Emacs via a more familiar style of UI, and who do not want or are unable to customize it this way themselves.

It includes many useful Emacs packages that would otherwise have to be installed separately.

I've added links to the libraries above, when found. Please add the remaining libraries to Emacs Wiki (ElispArea) or provide links to them elsewhere. It's useful for people to be able to 1) look at the code and 2) pick up individual libraries. -- DrewAdams

I've made some research using Google and added links to some libraries above. I also replaced the perldoc.el link, because the link http://www.gnusoftware.com/Emacs/Lisp/perldoc.el is buggy. -- ViniciusJoseLatorre
