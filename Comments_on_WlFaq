How do I install wanderlust, together with all dependencies?

It would be really nice if this page were to give step-by-step instructions on how to install Wanderlust with el-get, and where to find the support packages (SEMI, APEL, and FLIM), if one chooses not to use el-get for some reason.  The Wanderlust FAQ page has only dead FTP links to those libraries, and there are no instructions in the github INSTALL file (which seems __very__ stale).  At the very least, we should have good pointers to the required libraries.
