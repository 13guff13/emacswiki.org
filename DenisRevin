Hello there! My name is Denis Revin(i'm [::dut] at freenode). Sorry for my awful English. :-) I live in Russia, Astrakhan, but I don't drink vodka and we don't have a lot of bears here, who walking on streets and speaking on iso-8859-5((they speak in koi8-r, really.) But we have new program: learn bears to speak on UTF-8).

I'm using Debian GNU/Linux since 2002 and just start using emacs as my default text editor :D.

It's amazing to use this great software(emacs, GNU/Linux and lots and lots of free software) and have a lots of friends which use this software too! :-)

And yes-yes-yes! I'm red-eyed linuxoid. I worship to RMS and GNU/Linux! Hari RMS, hari emacs! Hari Torvalds, hari GNU/Linux! Mwahaha! Kill Wendowz! Burn Fsckosoft!

I like Python language too(but russian bears don't speak on it).

And remember: free bear is not like free beer :-)
