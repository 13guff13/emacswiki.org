A documentation string, or '''[::doc string]''', is part of a symbol's definitions in EmacsLisp that
describes the purpose of the object to a human, and are an important part
of the SelfDocumentation feature of Emacs and EmacsLisp in general.
The various describe-commands are one way to have access to these strings.

A doc string might explain to a user what a function or variable is for,
what possible arguments a function understands, expects and what it returns,
what other functions or variables the user might be interested in, where to find
more information and so on.

These strings are defined among the code.  For example `defun', the
command to describe new functions, has the syntax ##(defun NAME
ARGLIST [DOCSTRING] BODY...)##, where the optional argument for
defining the string can be seen.  Thus in the example

    (defun hello-world nil
      "Greets the world.
    This function implements the canonical example program."
      (interactive)
      (message "Hello world!"))

the doc string is 

      "Greets the world.
    This function implements the canonical example program.".

Remember that doc strings and comments are different.  Comments are
visible to someone who takes a look into the EmacsLisp programs
themselves, and usually are meant as notes for developing the code
itself.

With good CodingStyle the very first line of the doc string ought to give a very
summarized, self-sufficient description of the code.  More verbose
text should follow.  See CheckDoc mode to check your coding style.
