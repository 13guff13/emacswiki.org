upcase-word, downcase-word, and capitalize-word come in handy, but they don't go far enough.  Some suggestions:

* pluralize-word: Converts the word after point to its plural.  Does The Right Thing for both nouns and verbs.  See PluralizeEnglish.
* singularize-word: the opposite.
* dualize-word: An inflected form used in some languages
* {past,present,future}-tense-verb: The obvious.  No effect on non-verbs.
* [[Synonyms]] provides a list of synonyms for a word.
* change-gender command

My goodness, that's quite ambitious.  Wouldn't this require grammar guides in some parsable form, for supported languages? Perhaps Ispell can do some of this now, though - it does recognize some plurals, etc.  Not that I think that Emacs can't extend to that point someday.  But there are a lot of problems to be overcome before this could become a reality, I should think.  I would be interested in hearing how this could be implemented. -- CharlesSebold
