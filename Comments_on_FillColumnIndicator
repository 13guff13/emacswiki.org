> However, it would be good if, once loaded, fci-mode was enabled by default for most text and programming modes and disabled for special buffers (like *Messages*, *Buffer List*, *Completions*, etc)

You can do something like this:

(add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'fci-mode)

As most of programming modes inherited from prog-mode you can got what you want.
