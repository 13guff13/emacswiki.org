Due to the fact that MPlayer recommends use of non-free software (and in part due to the poor quality of its backend interface), all MPlayer support code has been removed from the main [[Bongo]] repository.

Bongo developers recommend VLC as a superior alternative to MPlayer.  However, if you still want to use MPlayer, this package lets you do it.

Here is an example of how the MPlayer website recommends to users that they download non-free binary codecs:

: “For a complete MPlayer installation you will need sources, a set of binary codecs, and a skin if you want a graphical user interface.”

Mathematicians insist, however, that sets can be empty, thereby making the above hardly a recommendation at all.
