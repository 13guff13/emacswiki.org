I haven't worked on this project in ages, and I don't think it's that useful to anyone else.  [[DeleteMeIn2013]].  Or remove this note and take ownership of the project.

Jiseki is an idea of further turning Emacs into your OS.  It aims to
be similar to your typical desktop/dashboard.

Right now this is in very Beta mode, and needs some help from other competent elisp hackers.

== Installation ==
Download here: Lisp:jiseki.el
As is usual with most elisp, put this file somewhere on your load path, and just add to your emacs file:
{{{
(require 'jiseki)
}}}

== Configuration  ==
Jiseki is super configurable like [[Anything]] or AutoComplete, and
has a similar configuration scheme.  If you are used to how these
packages are configured, then configuring Jiseki will be a breeze.

The variable jiseki-sources contains a list of all the "widgets" for your desktop.

Currently the only Jiseki items provided are a few different clocks
(time, unix time, and sunrise/sunset).  Creating new Jiseki items is
fairly simple.  Once this package matures, more will be made
available.

== Usage ==
You can use jiseki-dwim function to push/pop the desktop, just like
the Mac dashboard key.  I bound it to F3.
{{{
(global-set-key [f3] 'jiseki-dwim)
}}}

jiseki-desktop will show the desktop.  jiseki-push will show the
desktop as well, but allow you to go back to the previous window
configuration with jiseki-pop. 

== Other Packages that work with Jiseki ==
* Lisp:work-timer.el - (bundled with jiseki.el)
* Lisp:yahoo-weather.el - (source provided by yahoo-weather.el, but you need to add it to your sources yourself.)

== Trivia ==
The name comes from the Japanese word 自席 which translates to "one's
seat" or "one's place".  I went for this name because the concept of a
desktop in emacs has a very different meaning.

== Bugs ==
