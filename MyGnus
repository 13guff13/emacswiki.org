*This used to be a website for Gnus users. It no longer exists.*

The URL used to be http://my.gnus.org/ and the motto was "To boldly frobnicate what no newbie has grokked before."

You can try the #gnus channel on Freenode, if you want to talk about Gnus on InternetRelayChat.

== Where are the FAQs ==

It seems that this website hosted formerly the Gnus frequently asked questions (see [[GnusQuestions]]).
The FAQs are now part of the Gnus distribution and you can read them in the info page: use <code>C-h i m gnus RET</code> to get there.
You can also find them in their section at the [http://gnus.org/manual/gnus_toc.html Gnus manual].
The FAQs are in the file gnus-faq.texi from the Gnus CVS repository ([http://gnus.org/distribution.html]); see it here: [http://quimby.gnus.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/gnus/texi/gnus-faq.texi gnus-faq.texi]
