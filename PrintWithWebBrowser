<code>htmlfontify.el</code> can make an html view of any buffer in Emacs. 
Emacs has a command (<code>browse-url-of-file</code>) to send any html file to the selected web browser.

Adding these two things together you suddenly have a way to get a snapshot of the buffer's view in your web browser.
And - finally - if you can print from your web browser, then this gives a simple way to preview and print (with colors) from Emacs.

I implemented this in <code>hfyview.el.</code>
Beside printing a buffer it can print a window or frame, see the example at
http://ourcomments.org/Emacs/nXhtml/doc/htmlfontify-example.html.
If you want to it can also add a Quick Print entry in the File menu.

To easily distribute <code>htmlfontify.el + hfyview.el</code> I have put them in [NxhtmlMode nXthml].

[question]
How does bundling something in with an unrelated package that many people don't need make it easy? I can find htmlfontify.el as a separate download, but where do I get hfyview.el?

It makes it easy for me ...;-)
And actually for you since doing it this way I can find time to keep it updated all the time.
Please look at the reposity for [NxhtmlMode nXhtml].
You will find <code>hfyview.el</code> in the util subdir.
(But actually I think it is less trouble to just install nXhtml.)

Note:
This was originally written for MS Windows because I could not find an easy way to print there, 
but it is OS independent. From the beginning this was implemented using <code>htmlize.el</code> and <code>htmlize-view.el</code>.
I switched to <code>htmlfontify.el</code> instead because htmlfontify could take care of a bit more cases
and because htmlfontify will hopefully also soon be part of Emacs. (Here on %%EmacsWiki%% there is an old version for MS Windows called Lisp:w32-winprint.el)
