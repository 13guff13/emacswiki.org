Hello,

Is it possible to add sections like in http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/header2.el, that are self-updating at each save?

<code>
;; Commands (interactive functions) defined here:
;;
;;
;; Other functions defined here:
;;
;;
;; User options (variables) defined here:
;;
;;
;; Other variables defined here:
;;
</code>

Thank you so much for header2.
