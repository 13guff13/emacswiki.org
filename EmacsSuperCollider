== SuperCollider tools for Emacs ==
''[Supercollider] has an Emacs mode, but unfortunately it has bitrotted. This isn’t surprising – they’ve got a great IDE now. Still, you’ll pry Emacs from my COLD DEAD HANDS.''

I’ve written some extensions to the SuperCollider Emacs mode. Get them from GitHub or MELPA:

:: <code>M-x package-install sclang-extensions</code>

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperCollider Supercollider] has a nice emacs mode for working with the supercollider server and editing supercollider code

The mode itself appears to come with Supercollider?
