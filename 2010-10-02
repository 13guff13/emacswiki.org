[http://xahlee.blogspot.com/2010/10/emacs-dev-inefficiency-and-emacs-web-20.html Xah Lee mentioned Emacs Wiki] in a recent blog post.
He [http://xahlee.org/emacs/emacs_wiki_problem.html talked about Emacs Wiki Problems] before, back in 2008.
Both posts had their origins in newsgroups.

What do you think?
What changes would you make, if you were in charge?
Would you switch to Mediawiki? Why?
How would you find editors to improve the wiki all across the board?
How would you reorganize the wiki?

Back in 2008 I wrote a lot of articles on the newsgroup defending the current state of Emacs Wiki. But perhaps I was wrong, perhaps times have changed.
Let me know.

Thanks.

I read Xahs blog post, and there are probably some things, that are
worth thinking about. However, there is one thing he is certainly
right about: //"Emacswiki has its own agenda."// And I FWIW think it is
a *good* one.

Strongly regulated Wikis like the Wikipedia have merits of their own,
but I really like the less rigid ways of emacswiki; in a way, its
organisation cures exactly some of the problems Xah mentions: Drew
Adams Icicles is an excellent addition to emacs, I don't know if he
ever tried to get it in, but such a complex addition would certainly
take loooong anyways. But the emacswiki offers it a home, and a very
prominent one as it is. Diversity is a good thing, as long as there
are some fixed points people can turn to. Emacswiki is such a fixed
point in the emacs universe, just like the info manuals are. Probably
because of this, he proposed emacswiki to change to his idea of a
 //"coherent and comprehensive"// resource: But this totally misses the
point and *value* of what emacswiki is today. I would certainly miss
the old wiki. 

Regarding the 'links tend to prefer sister sites and not wikipedia':
Well, if that is what the *authors* link to, thats the way it is! I
never saw anyone correcting a link to wikipedia in favor of another
site. 

On the wikisoftware used, I really have no oppinion on that. The site
works fine for me, but I hardly ever used those //"more powerfull"// other
wikisoftware. The blog post touches some relevant points, but those
targeting the emacswiki really do not seem compelling to me. Keep up
the good work, and thanks for *emacswiki*.
