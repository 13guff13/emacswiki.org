[http://xahlee.blogspot.com/2010/10/emacs-dev-inefficiency-and-emacs-web-20.html Xah Lee mentioned Emacs Wiki] in a recent blog post.
He [http://xahlee.org/emacs/emacs_wiki_problem.html talked about Emacs Wiki Problems] before, back in 2008.
Both posts had their origins in newsgroups.
[http://groups.google.com/group/gnu.emacs.help/browse_frm/thread/a62f24e5707a91e2]
[http://groups.google.com/group/comp.emacs/browse_thread/thread/96700c14922315fc#] 

What do you think?
What changes would you make, if you were in charge?
Would you switch to Mediawiki? Why?
How would you find editors to improve the wiki all across the board?
How would you reorganize the wiki?

Back in 2008 I wrote a lot of articles on the newsgroup defending the current state of Emacs Wiki. But perhaps I was wrong, perhaps times have changed.
Let me know.

Thanks.

I read Xahs blog post, and there are probably some things, that are
worth thinking about. However, there is one thing he is certainly
right about: //"Emacswiki has its own agenda."// And I FWIW think it is
a *good* one.

Strongly regulated Wikis like the Wikipedia have merits of their own,
but I really like the less rigid ways of emacswiki; in a way, its
organisation cures exactly some of the problems Xah mentions: Drew
Adams Icicles is an excellent addition to emacs, I don't know if he
ever tried to get it in, but such a complex addition would certainly
take loooong anyways. But the emacswiki offers it a home, and a very
prominent one as it is. Diversity is a good thing, as long as there
are some fixed points people can turn to. Emacswiki is such a fixed
point in the emacs universe, just like the info manuals are. Probably
because of this, he proposed emacswiki to change to his idea of a
 //"coherent and comprehensive"// resource: But this totally misses the
point and *value* of what emacswiki is today. I would certainly miss
the old wiki. 

Regarding the 'links tend to prefer sister sites and not wikipedia':
Well, if that is what the *authors* link to, thats the way it is! I
never saw anyone correcting a link to wikipedia in favor of another
site. 

On the wikisoftware used, I really have no oppinion on that. The site
works fine for me, but I hardly ever used those //"more powerfull"// other
wikisoftware. The blog post touches some relevant points, but those
targeting the emacswiki really do not seem compelling to me. Keep up
the good work, and thanks for *emhe acswiki*.

I don't read Xah, but want to bring up instead that I pine for the days when Emacs development was more measured.  It was painfully slower, but I think there was a closer following of new features and changes by the community and especially this Wiki.  Emacs blogs for posting tricks generates a lot of excitement, but is not necessarily ideal.  Introducing an Emacs packaging system and repository system will likely prove similarly to be a mistake.  Emacs's value is its monolithic nature.  Contributed packages should be reviewed and made consistent with the Emacs whole.

There's a lot of glory to be had in building some new fangled Emacs Web 2.0 site or moving the wiki to Media Wiki, but the real value is in documenting and making Emacs more useful.  There's also a lot of great material at Emacs Wiki, it just needs constant organizing, updating and tending too.  Perhaps, we could develop a strategy to get more of this done and recruit others.  The Emacs Wiki staying the same will not work forever, but installing a different Wiki is not a solution, either.  

PS. 
Icicles has been proposed for Emacs before.[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-07/msg00174.html][http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-07/msg00186.html]

: 'there was a closer following of new features and changes by the community and especially this Wiki'

: A well edited blog which regularly summarizes developments (interesting threads on the devel list, interesting changes in the wiki) would be great for this, because it could be a central point of news of Emacs and it could link to the interesting stuff, so people could go there as a main source of new information and find the intersting stuff. -anon

Please not Mediawiki.  To me it is more important what wiki markup is used than what wiki software is used.  Of course these often correlates and probably my focus is for "strategic" reasons :-)  I for one would like to see the markup move into the direction of markdown or even better org-mode.  Using markdown would have the benefit that many wiki systems could be tried out independently - either org-mode or something standard.  If markdown were used everybody who thinks that the Emacswiki should move to myfavoredwiki could just setup a mirror and demonstrate it's superiority, or forever hold their peace.  Of course someone would have to convert existing pages...

If it was one me to decide what engine the Emacswiki should use it would be org-mode.  See http://orgmode.org/worg for such a wiki.  But it should be possible to edit the wiki on the web also (web edits could still be anonymous).  -- JonasBernoulli

Dunno what the supposed problems are, but I for one prefer that we keep things the way they are.  A selfish reason no doubt, but non-trivial for me: I might have to spend hours reformatting things if the markup or its rendering were to change.  For me, what we have now works, and works quite well.  ''Why'' change?  "If it aint broke don't fix it."  Count me against changing, at least until I see some great upside to the change.

IIUC, an argument was made for a different and better kind of Emacs wiki/blog site.  Great -- let a hundred flowers bloom.  But why would that require %%EmacsWiki%% to change?  What's wrong with people setting up another site if they would like something different?  Nothing wrong with that.  There is nothing sacred or exclusive about %%EmacsWiki%%.  It's just one place where some people like to contribute and that some people find useful.  Nothing says that it is or it should be the only such place.

[P.S. Is that [http://xahlee.blogspot.com/2010/10/emacs-dev-inefficiency-and-emacs-web-20.html blog page] any indication of the formatting resulting from using different wiki software? I hope not. In IE 7.0, at least, it is rendered pretty poorly: the two title lines overlap (is it intentional, as artistry perhaps?), and that problem remains even at full screen.  But at least at full screen the text lines are not truncated, as they are in my normal browser window (portrait layout).  And when I clicked some seemingly plain text in the window, just to give it focus, the browser hung for several minutes -- I think maybe it thought I was clicking a radio button near the text in order to "vote".  Sheesh.  Not really my idea of Web UI progress.  Anyway, I imagine this is unrelated to the potential wiki-engine changes for %%EmacsWiki%%.  Just thought I'd mention it in case it is related.]

I also fear the effort of converting pages over to the markup required by some other content management system.

As for markup, the "standard" for wikis would be [http://www.wikicreole.org/ WikiCreole] â€“ I have a plugin that implements it. These could be added to the current mix of rules. There'd be some uncertainty because I can't be sure that this will not have unintended consequences for a few rare pages, but it'd be a lot less effort compared to switching to an entirely new wiki software. Or I could add a plugin that implements BB Code. It's used on a lot of forums. But I don't think that Xah was actually referring to markup.

I think Xah had something more Web 2.0 in mind. Something with more bling, less arcane, more AJAX and less HTML forms, something cool, something big, something neat, with quality text, and a process, and a workflow. Something hard to put into words. But I don't see how we could do it. I don't think I'd want to contribute to something like it.

Personally, that's why I'm with Drew: Let other people try it. The Emacs Wiki pages have a generous license. Use it to seed the next big Emacs site. But I'm not going to spend time on it.
