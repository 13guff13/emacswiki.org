I don't like that `##dired-(next|previous)-line##' moves to "not useful" lines in DiredMode, like the empty ones between inserted subdirectores, so I came up with this simple defun that suit my needs better.

 (defun dired-next-file-line ()
   "Moves to the next dired line that have a file or directory name on
 it"
   (interactive)
   (call-interactively 'dired-next-line)
   (if (not (dired-move-to-filename))
       (dired-next-file-line)))
 
 (defun dired-previous-file-line ()
   "Moves to the previous dired line that have a file or directory name
 on it"
   (interactive)
   (call-interactively 'dired-previous-line)
   (if (not (dired-move-to-filename))
       (dired-previous-file-line)))

I changed the place of the last line in each function. This works for me.
