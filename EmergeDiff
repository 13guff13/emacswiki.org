Emerge is a graphical frontend to the UNIX "diff" and "diff3" commands. It is useful if two programmers on a project team both changed the same file and you need to integrate their changes.

Here is the Ediff manual section for emerge:

Also, you might want to set the "emerge-diff-options" variable to "--ignore-all-space", so that emerge doesn't waste your time by displaying differences in whitespace. You can do so by putting the following line in your ~/.emacs:

    (setq emerge-diff-options "--ignore-all-space")
