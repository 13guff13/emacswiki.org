The EmacsWiki Centeral Repository for all things Javascript.

Emacs has 2 major Javascript modes:
* js-mode (javascriptMode) which is a barebones mode built upon cc-mode.  It used to be called espresso-mode at one time, but got folded into the emacs core
* js2-mode (Js2Mode)  which is a full blown IDE style mode, with its own parser.
