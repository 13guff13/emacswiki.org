The EmacsWiki Centeral Repository for all things Javascript.

Emacs has 2 major Javascript modes:
* js-mode (JavascriptMode) which is a barebones mode built upon cc-mode.  It used to be called espresso-mode at one time, but got folded into the emacs core
* js2-mode ([[Js2Mode]])  which is a full blown IDE style mode, with its own parser.
* ECMAScriptMode is another javascript mode, but it's last update was 2005.  You're likely better off using js-mode

There are also a number of ways to integrate with javascript subprocesses:
* Swank-Js, a full blown swank/slime backend for node.js and can conncet to a running webbrowser process through the socket.io package.  https://github.com/swank-js/swank-js
* js-comint.el is a lightweight comint integration package, that also seems to integrate with org-mode nicely. http://js-comint-el.sourceforge.net/
* [[JavaScriptShell]] A REPL for Windows Scripting Host, and a [[Lisp:jsshell-bundle.el]]
* [[WshRepl]] A decrepit console into the Windows Scripting Host from within emacs.  It does have a project on github, and is looking for a maintainer

There are a number of helpful modes and elisp packages to working with javascript as well:
* FlymakeJavaScript
* [[Ejacs]], which is an Ecma-262 compliant Javascript interpreter written IN emacs lisp
* [[QuickMode]] to execute your current JS buffer

Finally There are some specifc modes available as well:
* GwtMuMaMo Multiple Major Mode (MuMaMo) for working with the Google Web Toolkit
* [[CouchdbDocument]] interacting with couchDB
