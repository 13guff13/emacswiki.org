== Commentary ==
This library provides the commands to navigate and display the mark ring.
The `show-marks' command displays a buffer listing the marks in the buffer from which it was called.
You can then press enter on one of the listed marks to jump to it, or press d to delete it from the
mark ring. You can also use the `forward-mark' and `backward-mark' commands to navigate the marks in
the mark ring. 
== Installation ==

* If you have [http://www.marmalade-repo.org/ marmalade-repo.org], this mark is part of the emacs packages you can install.  
Just type M-x package-install mark marmalade 
* Otherwise download the library from here Lisp:mark.el, and put it in a directory in the emacs load path, 
like ~/.emacs.d
* Add (require 'mark) in your ~/.emacs file
* I recommend also binding the commands to global keys, e.g:
{{{
   (global-set-key (kbd "<C-s-right>") 'forward-mark)
   (global-set-key (kbd "<C-s-left>") 'backward-mark)
   (global-set-key (kbd "<C-s-down>") 'show-marks)
}}}
