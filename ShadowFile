From the commentary:
This package helps you to keep identical copies of files in more than one
place -- possibly on different machines.  When you save a file, it checks
whether it is on the list of files with "shadows", and if so, it tries to
copy it when you exit Emacs.

I use the following to copy my ~/NOTES file to a fileserver at the end of
the day on a Windows machine. Since the fileshare is mounted as a separate
drive, I have to provide my own machine name as the "host".

    (require 'shadowfile)
    (setq shadow-literal-groups
          '(("/asc@BSIZUG04:h:/Alex Schröder/NOTES"
             "/asc@BSIZUG04:~/NOTES")))

To be honest, I also ##(prefer-coding-system 'utf-8)##, so that I'm using the
control character ##\366## instead of the ##ö## in the filename. ;) -- AlexSchroeder

It took me a long time to figure out that shadowfile doesn't deal with "localhost" very well when setting up a shadow via shadow-define-literal-group.  You need to use your actual hostname, which can be rather tough to figure out on Windows and Mac OS X systems.  On Windows it's usually the Netbios name/Computer name.  On Mac OS X it's usually the name under System Preferences -> Sharing -> Computer name with all punctuation and spacing removed and .local append to the name.  This is nowhere within shadow's documentation in the GNU Emacs info manual.

I also haven't tested it out with Tramp yet.  All in all a nice feature but its documentation needs improvement.  -- SamPeterson
