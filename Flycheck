Flycheck is a modern on-the-fly syntax checking extension, and a modern alternative to Flymake. It supports [http://flycheck.readthedocs.org/en/latest/manual/languages.html 39 languages] with 65 syntax checkers out of the box. It is available and well documented [https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck on GitHub].

== JSLint with Flycheck ==

As of April 2014, Flycheck has no built in support for JSLint (but does include support for jshint, eslint, and gjslint). Fortunately support is straight forward to add.

1. Install [http://nodejs.org/ Node.js].

2. Install [https://github.com/FND/jslint-reporter jslint-reporter] into: <code>~/.emacs.d/jslint-reporter</code>

3. Download JSLint (or JSHint, using <code>--jshint</code>):

<pre>
$ cd ~/.emacs.d/jslint-reporter
$ node wrapper.js --upgrade
</pre>

4. From EShell (CategoryEshell) test jslint-reporter

Unix:

<pre>
$ ~/.emacs.d/jslint-reporter test.js
test.js:2:1:'console' was used before it was defined.
</pre>

Windows:

<pre>
$ ~/.emacs.d/jslint-reporter.bat test.js
test.js:2:1:'console' was used before it was defined.
</pre>

5. Install [https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck Flycheck].

6. Add to <code>~/.emacs</code> <em>(on Windows <code>"~/.emacs.d/jslint-reporter.bat"</code>):</em>

<pre>
(require 'flycheck)
(flycheck-define-checker javascript-jslint-reporter
  "A JavaScript syntax and style checker based on JSLint Reporter.

See URL `https://github.com/FND/jslint-reporter'."
  :command ("~/.emacs.d/jslint-reporter" source)
  :error-patterns
  ((error line-start (1+ nonl) ":" line ":" column ":" (message) line-end))
  :modes (js-mode js2-mode js3-mode))
(add-hook 'js-mode-hook (lambda ()
                          (flycheck-select-checker 'javascript-jslint-reporter)
                          (flycheck-mode)))
</pre>

7. Restart Emacs to make sure everything loads fine.

8. Test by opening above <code>test.js</code>.
