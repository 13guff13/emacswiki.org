Systems administrator in Samara, Russia.

Use Emacsen since around 1997. First, it was XEmacs, but for the last six or seven years it's GNU Emacs. 

The Emacs modes which I use every day (and sometimes at night) are Org-mode and html-helper-mode.

Emacs is especially good when used with the window manager StumpWM.

I am a moderator at the history forum at [http://www.simaqianstudio.com Sima Qian Studio]. Also, I run a blog on history of Russia at [http://minaev.blogspot.com De Rebus Antiquis Et Novis].
