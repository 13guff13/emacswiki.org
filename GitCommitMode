== Configuration examples ==
<pre>
    (defun my-turn-on-toggle-save-place ()
       (toggle-save-place 0))

    (require 'git-commit)
    (add-hook 'git-commit-mode-hook 'turn-on-flyspell)
    (add-hook 'git-commit-mode-hook 'my-turn-on-toggle-save-place)
</pre>

The last line is handy if you have save-place on by default. When you
make a new commit, it would then normally place the cursor where a
previously edited commit message was finished, because to the
save-place functionality, it looks as though it's the same file.
