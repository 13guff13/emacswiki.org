Emacs comes with ##log-edit.el## a mode for editing commit messages for various version control systems. It is used by VersionControl.

It appears that not every Git user was aware of its existence or wanted written another mode from scratch for some other reason. So various implementations of ##git-commit[-mode].el## exist.

* Florian Ragwitz's old implementations of ##git-commit.el## can be found [https://github.com/rafl/git-commit-mode here].
* Sebastian Wiesner took that implementation, improved it by adding some fancy features, renamed it to ##git-commit-mode.el##, and bundled it with some other git-related libraries and called the resulting repository ##git-modes##. While these libraries live in the same repository, they are available as separate packages from Melpa.
* Magit used to bundle yet another implementation ##magit-log-edit.el##.
* Jonas Bernoulli merged Sebastians' ##git-commit-mode.el## and Magit's ##magit-log-edit.el##. The former name was kept, the library remained in the ##git-modes## repository (which was moved to [https://github.com/magit/git-modes magit/git-modes]), and Jonas became its new maintainer.
* That library became the new official commit mode used by Magit and ##magit-log-edit.el## was removed from Magit. Some people disagree with Magit's maintainer view that ##magit-log-edit.el## is inferior to ##git-commit-mode.el## in every way; so he released the former as a separate package to get those people of his back. You should not use it.
