==What's is ChmView==
: ChmView is mode that view CHM file in Emacs.

: It is base on "archmage". 
:: (archmage is a program that acts as  HTTP server on specified port number, so you can read CHM file with your favourite borwser.)
:: And ChmView integrate "archmage" with Emacs, you can use [[emacs-w3m]] (or any browser you like) browse CHM file.

==Install==
* Install archmage:
: Because ChmView is base on "archmage", so make sure you have install "archmage" in your system, like me (I use Debian) :
:: sudo aptitude install archmage

* Install elisp file:
: Put Lisp:chm-view.el in your load-path, and add 
:: (require 'chm-view)
: in ~/.emacs

==Setup==
: I recommend you install [[emacs-w3m]], and setup variable  "browse-url-browser-function" with "w3m-browse-url", then you can view CHM file in Emacs!
Like below:
:: (setq browse-url-browser-function 'w3m-browse-url)

==Usage==
* View CHM file:
: You can use command "chm-view-file" view CHM file in browser.

* Integrate with dired:
: You can bind command "chm-view-dired" with "dired-mode-map", then you can view CHM file that marked in dired.

==Note==
: Because "archmage" needs time to extract the CHM file, the browser (such as [[emacs-w3m]]) might open a special port before the "archmage" extract is completed. if this occurs,  you will get an error: "Cannot retrieve URL: http://localhost:531560 (exit status: 0)". Just refresh the current page to fix. 
: If you always get this error when opening a CHM file, you need to set 'chm-view-delay' to a larger number (default is 0.3 second).

==Customize==
: All above setup can customize by:
: M-x customize-group RET chm-view RET

* "chm-view-delay" 
:: The delay time before view CHM file.
:: This is necessary spend time start sub-process.
