An implementation of the bidi algorithm described in UAX#9 is
available.  The implementation supports implicit bidirectionality. The
implicit bidirectional algorithm and the directional marks RLM and LRM
are supported.  Full bidirectionality would entail the implicit
bidirectional algorithm, the implicit directional marks, and the
explicit directional embedding codes: RLM, LRM, LRE, RLE, LRO, RLO,
PDF.

The current implementation is useful when transforming logical to
visual order and back.  The logical to visual transformation will be
part of the DisplayEngineForBiDi, so it will probably be a feature for
Emacs Lisp authors only.  The visual to logical transformation may be
usefull to convert text from the clipboard, assuming that other
applications put text in visual order into the clipboard.

The bidi code needs BiDiTables that classify characters according to
the bidi types used in the Unicode Tech Report.
