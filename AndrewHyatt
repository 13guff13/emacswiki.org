I'm a software engineer that spends most of my day in emacs.  I use it for reading mail, IM, and of course writing code.

I used to contribute to the JDE project.  I currently make minor contributions to the OrgMode project.

I have started and am working on the [[Google_Wave_for_Emacs]] project, a project to create a client for Google Wave in emacs.
