This is the only tutorial I actually fully understand in ew. To the person who wrote this, thank you so much in explaining the concept using languages to a non-computer expert.

This is a great tutorial! Although, I'm surprise of the lack of information on getting Ispell/Aspell to work with Emacs on Windows, and that it requires the use of a free software binary more than a decade old. It's a pretty standard requirement for some.
