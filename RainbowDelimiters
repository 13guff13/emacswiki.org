<b>[[RainbowDelimiters]]</b> is a "rainbow parentheses" mode to colorize parentheses, brackets, and braces. It conveys nesting depth by using a new color for each for each nested level. It correctly colorizes statements of the same depth - if two statements are the same level, they will be the same color.

Each set of delimiters "()[]{}" is colored independently from one another. Parens, brackets, and braces are all colored based on their own depth independent of one another, so even a bracket nested within several levels of parentheses will start with the first (outermost) color, moving to the next color with each additional nested bracket.

You can customize the colors [[RainbowDelimiters]] uses.

<b>NOTE:</b> Colors were taken from the [[http://slinky.imukuppi.org/zenburnpage/ ZenBurn]] theme. If you wish to change them, please M-x customize-group rainbow-delimiters-faces or add the appropriate faces to your color-theme. The customize interface is crude for now.

Nice idea, but here are some thoughts about the implementation:
* Please require cl the way it should be done according to the Emacs manual.
* A lot of overlays might slow down Emacs. Can't you use text properties instead?

Thank you for your feedback. I'll use (eval-when-compile (require 'cl)) from now on; I hadn't been aware of that convention.

This code was forked from rainbow-parens.el, which was the best rainbow-parens mode I could find to build on. You'll notice it's already in the TODO section that overlays can be slow on large chunks of text with many parens.
I will look into text properties and see if it can be made to work that way. If so it would make sense to rewrite the mode from scratch using text properties instead of overlays.
If you have any more tips to point me in the right direction please don't hesitate to add them here; I really appreciate it.
