<b>[[RainbowDelimiters]]</b> is a "rainbow parentheses"-like mode which highlights each new level of parentheses, brackets, and braces in a different color according to their nesting. Displaying each level in a different color makes it easy to spot matching delimiters, orient yourself in the code, and tell what statements are at a given level.

Great care has been taken to make this mode FAST. You shouldn't see any change in scrolling or editing speed when it's on, even in delimiter-rich languages like Clojure/Lisp or Perl.

You can customize the colors [[RainbowDelimiters]] uses. The default colors are intentionally subtle; they are unobtrusive enough to make the mode worth looking at even if you usually don't like rainbow parentheses modes.

** Documentation changes.


= Setup instructions: =
1. Add Lisp:rainbow-delimiters.el to your load-path.

2. Byte-compile the file (necessary for speed):
<pre>
M-x byte-compile-file <location of rainbow-delimiters.el>
</pre>

3. Add the following to your dot-emacs/init file:
<pre>
(require 'rainbow-delimiters)
;; Add hooks for modes where you want it enabled, for example:
(add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook 'rainbow-delimiters-mode)
</pre>

* You can also activate the mode temporarily in a buffer with:
<pre>
        M-x rainbow-delimiters-mode
</pre>

4. *When using a dark background*, if delimiter colors seem washed out you may need to add the following to your dot-emacs/init file and restart Emacs:
<pre>
(setq-default frame-background-mode 'dark)
</pre>
More information about this is at the top of the Lisp:rainbow-delimiters.el file.


== Customization: ==

To *customize rainbow-delimiters mode*, you can use:
<pre>
M-x customize-group rainbow-delimiters
</pre>

=== Color Scheme ===
The customize group *Color Scheme* (aka <code>rainbow-delimiters-faces</code>) contains the faces for successive nested pairs of delimiters. You can change them to customize the color scheme for yourself.

The face <code>rainbow-delimiters-unmatched-face</code> is used for unmatched closing delimiters.

*Color-theme.el users:* Further information is available in the Lisp:rainbow-delimiters.el file.


=== Stop Highlighting Certain Delimiters: ===
You can *disable highlighting* of specific delimiter characters through the customize interface, in the *Toggle Delimiters* section.


== Other Information ==
Rainbow-delimiters comes with two *default color schemes*, for light and dark backgrounds. Emacs chooses which to used based on the value of variable 'frame-background-mode'.

The light/dark color schemes differ only in their brightness level.

[http://emacs-fu.blogspot.com/2011/05/toward-balanced-and-colorful-delimiters.html emacs-fu: toward balanced and colorful delimiters] is a blog post describing rainbow-delimiters, including a screenshot using a custom color theme.

== Contributing ==
If you want to add a feature to rainbow-delimiters.el, the current development version will always be at github under [http://github.com/jlr/rainbow-delimiters jlr/rainbow-delimiters]. Please communicate before starting work on anything large to make sure there isn't duplicate effort.
