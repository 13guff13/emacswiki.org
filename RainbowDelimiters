<b>[[RainbowDelimiters]]</b> is a "rainbow parentheses"-like mode for coloring parentheses, brackets, and braces based on their nesting depth. It gives a visual reference for which delimiters match and what statements are at the same depth - if two statements are the same level, they will be the same color.

Great care has been taken to make this mode FAST. You shouldn't see any change in scrolling or editing speed when it's on, even when working in delimiter-rich languages like Clojure, Lisp and Scheme.

You can customize the colors [[RainbowDelimiters]] uses. The default colors are intentionally subtle; it's easier to get used to a rainbow-parens mode this way. They look best on darker backgrounds. If you use a light background and want a set of darker faces, please leave a note on this wiki page and I will add faces for light backgrounds too. If you want your own set of colors, feel free to change the delimiter faces - information on this can be found below.

* Current release: 1.1.1

= Setup instructions: =
1. Add Lisp:rainbow-delimiters.el to your load-path.

2. Byte-compile the file (necessary for speed):
<pre>
M-x byte-compile-file <location of rainbow-delimiters.el>
</pre>

3. Add the following to your dot-emacs/init file:
<pre>
(require 'rainbow-delimiters)
;; Add hooks for modes where you want it enabled, for example:
(add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook 'rainbow-delimiters-mode)
</pre>

4. **OPTIONAL**: You can also activate the mode temporarily in a buffer with:
<pre>
M-x rainbow-delimiters-mode
</pre>

== Customizing the color scheme: ==
Each type of delimiter (paren, bracket, brace) has its own set of faces for depths 1-12.

To *customize the color scheme*, you can use:
<pre>
M-x customize-group rainbow-delimiters
</pre>
Or add appropriate entries for each face name to your color-theme.el.

The group <code>rainbow-delimiters-all-delimiters-faces</code> contains the default color scheme for the mode. The faces for parens, brackets and braces all inherit from this group. If you want to make a color scheme change that affects all delimiters, just change the faces in the all-delimiters group.

Further information is available in the Lisp:rainbow-delimiters.el file.
