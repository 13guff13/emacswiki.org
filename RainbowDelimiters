<b>NOTE: rainbow-delimiters is currently unavailable.</b> It was taken down due to problems using it with various modes. The author has found a better approach to implementing it; the mode is being rewritten from scratch and will be available again shortly.

<b>[[RainbowDelimiters]]</b> is a "rainbow parentheses" mode to colorize parentheses, brackets, and braces. It conveys nesting depth by using a new color for each for each nested level. It correctly colorizes statements of the same depth - if two statements are the same level, they will be the same color.

Each set of delimiters "()[]{}" is colored independently from one another. Parens, brackets, and braces are all colored based on their own depth independent of one another, so even a bracket nested within several levels of parentheses will start with the first (outermost) color, moving to the next color with each additional nested bracket.

You can customize the colors [[RainbowDelimiters]] uses.

<b>NOTE:</b> Colors were taken from the [[http://slinky.imukuppi.org/zenburnpage/ ZenBurn]] theme. If you wish to change them, please M-x customize-group rainbow-delimiters-faces or add the appropriate faces to your color-theme. The customize interface is crude for now.
