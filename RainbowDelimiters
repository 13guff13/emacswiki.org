<b>[[RainbowDelimiters]]</b> is a "rainbow parentheses"-like mode which highlights parentheses, brackets, and braces according to their depth. Each successive level is highlighted in a different color. This makes it easy to spot matching delimiters, orient yourself in the code, and tell which statements are at a given depth.

Great care has been taken to make this mode FAST. You shouldnâ€™t see any change in scrolling or editing speed even with delimiter-rich languages like Clojure, Lisp, and Scheme.

You can customize the color scheme [[RainbowDelimiters]] uses. Default colors are intentionally subtle, with the philosophy that syntax highlighting shouldn't be visually intrusive.


= Download: =
* [http://github.com/jlr/rainbow-delimiters/raw/master/rainbow-delimiters.el rainbow-delimiters.el]. Current release is always found on github at [http://github.com/jlr/rainbow-delimiters/ jlr/rainbow-delimiters].

* Current release: <b>1.3.4</b> (2012-04-27)
** Further optimize highlighting speed. Benchmarks show 2x improvement.
** Eliminate bottleneck seen in certain large files.
*** A large file which revealed this bottleneck now highlights ~40x faster.
** Color scheme for light backgrounds.
** Correct broken/incorrect highlighting reported in certain languages.
* Features:
** Correct highlighting for non-Lisp languages (/Perl, C, etc./). Respects syntax of the buffer major-mode.
** global-rainbow-delimiters mode: Use rainbow-delimiters editor-wide.
** Checkboxes to enable/disable highlighting of each type of delimiter.
** Customizable color scheme works with deftheme and color-theme.el.
** Infinite nesting depth by repeatedly cycling through defined faces.


= Setup instructions: =
1. Download rainbow-delimiters.el from git and add it to your emacs load-path.

2. Byte-compile the file (*necessary for speed*):
<pre>
M-x byte-compile-file <location of rainbow-delimiters.el>
</pre>

3. Add the following to your dot-emacs/init file:
<pre>
(require 'rainbow-delimiters)
</pre>

4. Enable the mode in your dot-emacs/init file. You can either use it only in certain editing modes, or use it Emacs-wide:

- To *use only with specific modes*, add lines like the following:
<pre>
(add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook 'rainbow-delimiters-mode)
</pre>

- To *enable in all programming-related modes* (Emacs 24+):
<pre>
(add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'rainbow-delimiters-mode)
</pre>

- To *use Emacs-wide*, add this line:
<pre>
(global-rainbow-delimiters-mode)

</pre>

To /toggle/ rainbow-delimiters mode while Emacs is running:

<code>        - </code>In a single buffer:
<code> M-x rainbow-delimiters-mode </code>

<code>        - </code>Globally (all buffers):
<code> M-x global-rainbow-delimiters-mode </code>

== Customization: ==

To *customize rainbow-delimiters mode*, you can use:
<pre>
M-x customize-group rainbow-delimiters
</pre>

=== Color Scheme ===
The customize group <code>rainbow-delimiters-faces</code> contains the faces for successive nested pairs of delimiters. You can change them to customize the color scheme for yourself.

The face <code>rainbow-delimiters-unmatched-face</code> is used for unmatched closing delimiters.

Color themes Zenburn and Solarized have added their own faces for the mode.

*deftheme*/color-theme.el: Further information is available at the top of rainbow-delimiters.el.


=== Stop Highlighting Certain Delimiters ===
You can *disable highlighting* of any of the supported delimiter types through the customize interface, in the *Toggle Delimiters* section.


== Other Information ==
Rainbow-delimiters comes with two *default color schemes*, for light and dark backgrounds. Emacs chooses which to used based on the value of variable 'frame-background-mode'.

[http://emacs-fu.blogspot.com/2011/05/toward-balanced-and-colorful-delimiters.html emacs-fu: toward balanced and colorful delimiters] is a blog post describing rainbow-delimiters, including a screenshot using a different color theme.

== Development Version/Contributing ==
The current development version is always at github, under [http://github.com/jlr/rainbow-delimiters jlr/rainbow-delimiters].

== Reporting Issues ==
Please send any bug reports or feature requests through the rainbow-delimiters [http://github.com/jlr/rainbow-delimiters github] page.
