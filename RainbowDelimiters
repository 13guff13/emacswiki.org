<b>[[RainbowDelimiters]]</b> is a "rainbow parentheses" mode to colorize parentheses, brackets, and braces. It conveys nesting depth by using a new color for each for each nested level. It correctly colorizes statements of the same depth - if two statements are the same level, they will be the same color.

Great care has been taken to make this mode FAST. You should see no discernable change in scrolling or editing speed when using it with delimiter-rich languages such as Clojure, Lisp and Scheme.

You can customize the colors [[RainbowDelimiters]] uses. Default colors are based on the [[http://slinky.imukuppi.org/zenburnpage/ ZenBurn]] theme.

* Lisp:rainbow-delimiters.el

= Setup instructions: =
1. Add Lisp:rainbow-delimiters.el to your load-path.

2. Byte-compile the file (necessary for speed):
<pre>
M-x byte-compile-file <location of rainbow-delimiters.el>
</pre>

3. Add the following to your dot-emacs/init file:
<pre>
(require 'rainbow-delimiters)
;; Add hooks for modes where you want it enabled, for example:
(add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook 'rainbow-delimiters-mode)
</pre>

4. **OPTIONAL**: You can also activate the mode temporarily in a buffer with:
<pre>
M-x rainbow-delimiters-mode
</pre>

== Customizing the color scheme: ==
Each type of delimiter (paren, bracket, brace) has its own set of faces for depths 1-12.

To *customize the color scheme*, you can use:
<pre>
M-x customize-group rainbow-delimiters
</pre>
Or add appropriate entries for each face name to your color-theme.el.

The group <code>rainbow-delimiters-all-delimiters-faces</code> contains the default color scheme for the mode. The faces for parens, brackets and braces all inherit from this group. If you want to make a color scheme change that affects all delimiters, just change the faces in the all-delimiters group.

Further information is available in the Lisp:rainbow-delimiters.el file.
