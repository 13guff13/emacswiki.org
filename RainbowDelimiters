<b>[[RainbowDelimiters]]</b> is a "rainbow parentheses"-like mode for coloring parentheses, brackets, and braces based on their nesting depth. It gives a visual reference for which delimiters match and what statements are at the same depth - if two statements are the same level, they will be the same color.

Great care has been taken to make this mode FAST. You shouldn't see any change in scrolling or editing speed when it's on, even when working in delimiter-rich languages like Clojure, Lisp and Scheme.

You can customize the colors [[RainbowDelimiters]] uses. The default colors are intentionally subtle; it's easier to get used to a rainbow-parens mode this way. 

= Download: =
* Lisp:rainbow-delimiters.el

* Current release: <b>1.2</b> (2011-03-28)
** All delimiters now use a single set of faces for their colors. Faces take the form <code>rainbow-delimiters-depth-#-face</code>.


= Setup instructions: =
1. Add Lisp:rainbow-delimiters.el to your load-path.

2. Byte-compile the file (necessary for speed):
<pre>
M-x byte-compile-file <location of rainbow-delimiters.el>
</pre>

3. Add the following to your dot-emacs/init file:
<pre>
(require 'rainbow-delimiters)
;; Add hooks for modes where you want it enabled, for example:
(add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook 'rainbow-delimiters-mode)
</pre>

4. **OPTIONAL**: You can also activate the mode temporarily in a buffer with:
<pre>
M-x rainbow-delimiters-mode
</pre>

== Customizing the color scheme: ==
To *customize the color scheme*, you can use:
<pre>
M-x customize-group rainbow-delimiters
</pre>
Or add appropriate entries for each face name to your color-theme.el.

Each nested depth uses a face of the form <code>rainbow-delimiters-depth-#-face</code>. Depth begins at 1, the outermost color. Faces are numbered from 1-12.

The group <code>rainbow-delimiters-faces</code> contains these faces. Parens, brackets and braces all use them. Change them to customize the color scheme for yourself.

*color-theme.el users:* Further information is available in the Lisp:rainbow-delimiters.el file.

*NOTE*: The default colors are a little easier to tell apart on darker backgrounds, though they look good with any background color. If you want a set of colors specifically for light backgrounds, please leave a note on this wiki page saying so and I'll add the appropriate light/dark options to the faces.
