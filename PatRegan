I have a short and simple [http://blog.patshead.com/blog/2009/10/screencast-yasnippet-for-emacs-now-supports-snippet-in-a-snippet.html screencast] posted on my [http://blog.patshead.com/blog/ blog] showing off [[Yasnippet]] mode's new snippet-in-a-snippet feature.

Welcome to the wiki. :) I really should start setting up some templating stuff for my Emacs. I'm always impressed by the screencasts but never felt the need to set it up myself. -- AlexSchroeder

I thought the screencast was rather good as well. If you have yasnippet templates and related Emacs configuration, perhaps they could be in a respository for viewing? What is the onscreen keypress indicator software used in the screencast?
