This provides single command (/show) for the EmacsIRCClient that allows you to send the result of evaluating a lisp expression to the current channel.

Usage is simple, just type <code>/show</code> followed by a lisp expression, for example:

    >>> /show (let ((x 'a) (y 'b)) (list x y))
    (let ((x 'a) (y 'b)) (list x y)) => (a b)

You can get erc-show.el from http://purl.org/NET/wence/erc-show.el

This now also deals with errors, instead of entering the debugger, it shows the error in question:
e.g.:

     >>> /show (system-type)
     (system-type) => Error: (void-function system-type)

[new]
Here's a version of erc-cmd-SHOW which ensures that the expression is evaluated within the correct (channel) buffer (for buffer-local values of things):

 (defun erc-cmd-SHOW (&rest form)
   "Eval FORM and send the result and the original form as:
 FORM => (eval FORM)."
   (let* ((form-string (mapconcat 'identity form " "))
          (result
           (condition-case err
               (eval (read-from-whole-string form-string))
             (error
              (format "Error: %s" error)))))
     (erc-send-message (format "%s => %S" form-string result))))
