== GNU Emacs ==

Starting with Emacs 23, you can set the [[face]] for the current [[buffer]], using `M-x buffer-face-set'. You can toggle this on/off using `M-x buffer-face-mode'.

Prior to Emacs 23, you can use the fact that font-lock uses a variable with the same name as the font-lock face. For example, font-lock does not necessarily use `font-lock-comment-face' for comments.  It uses the face
that is the value of [[variable]] `font-lock-comment-face', which by default
is face `font-lock-comment-face'.

 (make-face 'php-comment-face)
 (set-face-foreground 'php-comment-face "LightGrey")
 (add-hook 'php-mode-hook 
           (lambda ()
            ;; ...
            (set (make-local-variable 'font-lock-comment-face)
                 'php-comment-face)
            ;; ...


== XEmacs ==

XEmacs supports per-frame, per-window, and per-buffer face settings, using the confusing "specifier" functions:

 In XEmacs, on the other hand, the following will work:

 (set-specifier (face-background (get-face 'default)) "blue"
                (get-buffer "*scratch*"))

 Obviously, replace *scratch* and "blue" with whatever you want. (In a
 hook, you could just use (current-buffer)
