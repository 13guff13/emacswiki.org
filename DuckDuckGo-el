[http://duckduckgo.com DuckDuckGo] is a web search engine with an [http://api.duckduckgo.com easy API].

Lisp:ddg.el is the EmacsLisp API for searching and retrieving results from !DuckDuckGo.

== Usage ==

Lisp:ddg.el just have two main functions: 

* `(ddg-search TERM)' -- Search for a term synchronously.
* `(ddg-search-asyn TERM FUNCTION)' -- Search for a term asynchronously. 

In the asynchronous case when the request has finished, ddg will call the function passed as parameter `FUNCTION' with the result as a parameter. The result will be a JSON parsed list(take a look at the `json-read' function at the [[JSON]] package).

Example:

    (defun myfunc (res)
      (setq results res)
      ;; ...
      ;; ...
      )
    (ddg-search-asyn "site:emacswiki duckduckgo-el" 'myfunc)
