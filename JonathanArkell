My Emacs Anniversery is in May.  2 years so far.

Emacs projects are:

* I did some work on TwIt, and plan to do more.
* DevKitEmacs - A helper mode for interfacing with devkitpro.  Making the compilation and testing of NDS homebrew much easier.
* ToDoChiKu - A Growl/Snarl interface for emacs.  Comes with a few helpers.
* cruisecontrol.el - An Emacs Controller for CruiseControl.  Right now it just starts a build.
* [[Tagging]] - Originally from Conrad Barski M.D., I have heavily hacked it to work with ECB
* file-journal.el - I took it over, and started to make some adjustments.
* Lisp:work-timer.el - A simple timer that tells you when you need to start working, and when you need to start relaxing.  Uses ToDoChiKu. 
* JisekiDesktop - The final step to turning emacs into your OS.
* Lisp:org-jira.el - A simple package to hook up jira with org.  Right now provides a org to jira link.  More coming later.
* Lisp:i-ching.el - i-ching for Emacs.
* MojoSdk - Helper functions for interacting with the mojo SDK development tools. 
* Lisp:flip-tables.el  goofy fun. Put an emoji table flipper on your kill ring.

For one job I do Web Development.  My weapons of choice are org-mode, moz-repl, js2 and nxhtml.

For fun I write Scheme, I am working on a web/application server and Gambit for the Nintendo DS

OrgMode and ParEdit Mode are my favorite modes.  I am also fond of the Bovinator and ECB.

I am currently having problems with tab-completion in my cygwin shell.  I can't tab complete if I am in a directory with a space in it, and each tab completion ends with a backlash.
