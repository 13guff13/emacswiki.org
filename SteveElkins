I use emacs.

I think keeping part of my .emacs online is a fine idea.

    (global-font-lock-mode t)
    (setq font-lock-maximum-decoration t)
    (setq default-major-mode 'text-mode)
    (add-hook 'outline-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)
    ;; Set up the keyboard so the delete key on both the regular keyboard
    ;; and the keypad delete the character under the cursor and to the right
    ;; under X, instead of the default, backspace behavior.
    (global-set-key [delete] 'delete-char)
    (global-set-key [kp-delete] 'delete-char)
    ;; Always end a file with a newline
    (setq require-final-newline t)
    ;; Stop at the end of the file, not just add lines
    (setq next-line-add-newlines nil)
    ;; Enable wheelmouse support by default
    (require 'mwheel)

    ;; ...
    ;; and a couple of customizations, because I care so much about them
    (custom-set-variables
      ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom -- don't edit or cut/paste it!
      ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
     '(blink-cursor nil)
     '(cursor ((t (:background "blue")))))

I am reluctant to put my email address on a web page, so repunctuate sgelkins*bellsouth,net to send me a message.
