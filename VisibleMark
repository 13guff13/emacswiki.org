Tip: I like not highlighting the region with visible-mark.

Tip: I find setting a colored underline face less in-your-face than a colored 
background for the visible marks - especially if you're displaying all marks on 
the mark ring.


== Occur for mark ring ==

I wrote some elisp that displays the points in the mark ring.  It's modeled after Occur.  The line number for each point in the mark-ring is displayed as well as the contents of that line.  Pressing RET on the line will take you to the point from the mark-ring.  The function is called 'show-marks' and is available at http://therowes.net/~greg/code/emacs/emacs.d/mark.el
