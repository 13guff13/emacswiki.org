Tip: I like not highlighting the region with visible-mark.

Tip: I find setting a colored underline face less in-your-face than a colored 
background for the visible marks - especially if you're displaying all marks on 
the mark ring.

I use VisibleBookmarks as a visible mark -- [[rubikitch]]

I wrote some elisp that displays the points in the mark ring.  It's modeled after Occur.  The line number for each point in the mark-ring is displayed as well as the contents of that line.  Pressing RET on the line will take you to the point from the mark-ring.  The function is called 'show-marks' and is available at http://therowes.net/~greg/code/emacs/emacs.d/mark.el

There is also Lisp:himarks-mode.el available, which is known to work on XEmacs but not Gnu EMacs 
VisibleMark doesn't work with XEmacs, since XEmacs define-minor-mode doesn't have a BODY argument, which would be a minor fix.

It would be nice if a C-G (keyboard-quit) made the existing visible marks
invisible again (kind of a transient-visible-marks-mode).  That would let
you see them when you want them (e.g. while preparing for a transpose-region)
but hide them easily when they annoy. -- MarkTKennedy
