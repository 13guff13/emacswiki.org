Deft is an Emacs mode for quickly browsing, filtering, and editing directories of plain text notes, inspired by Notational Velocity and Simplenote.

Notational Velocity provides a show-hide function key, letting you pop in-and-out of the interface quickly.  I recreated a crude version of this in Deft, bound to f6.

Note - if you want to use a major-mode other than text-mode for your deft notes, set deft-note-extension to a file-extension that has an entry in [[AutoModeAlist|auto-mode-alist]]

{{{
(define-minor-mode deft-note-mode "Deft notes" nil " Deft-Notes" nil)
(setq deft-text-mode 'deft-note-mode)
(defun kill-all-deft-notes ()
  (interactive)
  (save-excursion
    (let((count 0))
      (dolist(buffer (buffer-list))
        (set-buffer buffer)
        (when (not (eq nil deft-note-mode))  
          (setq count (1+ count))
          (kill-buffer buffer)))
      )))
(defun deft-or-close () (interactive) (if (or (eq major-mode 'deft-mode) (not (eq nil deft-note-mode)))
                                          (progn (kill-all-deft-notes) (kill-buffer "*Deft*"))
                                        (deft)
                                        ))
(global-set-key [f6] 'deft-or-close)
}}}

I see some blocking behaviour with defts autosave feature after having emacs open for awhile with deft running, any suggestions on what this might be (only happens with the autosave in deft)? - anon
