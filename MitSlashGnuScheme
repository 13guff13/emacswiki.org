MIT/GNU Scheme is an implementation of the [[Scheme]] programming language.  Developed at MIT, the previous name of MIT Scheme was `C-Scheme', since it was a portable Scheme implemented in C rather than on [[Lisp]] hardware.  In 2001, MIT Scheme was adopted as a GNU package and renamed MIT/GNU Scheme.

The package provides an interpreter, the compiler named Liar, a source-code debugger, an integrated [[Emacsen]] editor called EdWin, and a large runtime library.
