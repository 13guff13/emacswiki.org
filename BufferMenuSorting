BufferMenu has various options to sort the listing of buffers.  According to the EmacsManual.

: ''The buffers are listed in the order that they were current; the buffers that were current most recently come first.''

What the manual fails to mention is that you can change the sorting with `M-x Buffer-menu-sort'.

; `M-2 M-x Buffer-menu-sort': Sort by buffer ''name''.
; `M-3 M-x Buffer-menu-sort': Sort by buffer ''size'' (ascending).
; `M-4 M-x Buffer-menu-sort': Sort by buffer ''mode'' name.
; `M-5 M-x Buffer-menu-sort': Sort by buffer ''file'' name.
; `M-x Buffer-menu-sort': Sort by ''display time'' (default).

=== Sort by Buffer Name ===

If your buffer list becomes too disorganized, you can sort it using this function:
  
  (defun sort-buffers ()
    "Put the buffer list in alphabetical order."
    (interactive)
    (dolist (buff (buffer-list-sorted)) (bury-buffer buff))
    (when (interactive-p) (list-buffers))
    )
  
  (defun buffer-list-sorted ()
    (sort (buffer-list) 
  	(function
  	 (lambda
  	   (a b) (string<
  		  (downcase (buffer-name a))
  		  (downcase (buffer-name b))
  		  )))))

and bind it with

  (global-set-key "\M-b"    'sort-buffers)

An extension like this became obsolete with Emacs 22.


To permanently customize the default listing order of buffer menu, set `Buffer-menu-sort-column'.  For example, use the following to automatically sort by column Mode.

   (setq Buffer-menu-sort-column 4)

[new]
You can easily sort on any column, in both directions, if you use BufferMenuPlus. If you instead use the vanilla BufferMenu, you can still sort the list in a couple of ways. -- DrewAdams
