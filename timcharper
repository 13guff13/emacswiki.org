= About Me =

I am a fan of both Vim and Emacs.  Emacs is great because it lets me use the best of every editor in one environment - I don't have to choose between Emacs or Vim.

I work here: http://leadmediapartners.com/

I program in Ruby.  I also have started to learn the functional programming paradigm, and have picked up lisp (which is what drove me to emacs, consequently).

= My Emacs =

I started out with Jim Weirech's configuration.  His is great, but had a lot of stuff that I didn't want.  I switched over to use Technomany's fabulous starter kit: http://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit

* RSpec mode: http://github.com/pezra/rspec-mode
* vi-balance: A version of viper-mode that harmonizes better with the great features you love about emacs editing.
* TextMate minor mode: http://github.com/defunkt/textmate.el
* ERC
* AucTex
* CEDET
* Rudel
