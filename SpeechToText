There are several packages for driving Emacs through voice input, including:

* vr-mode (http://emacs-vr-mode.sourceforge.net/)

:: It seems that vr does only work with Emacs on W32. Is there any equivalent using Dragon Naturally Speaking in a virtual network? I know something like this existed.

* Ascii2x (http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/a2x-voice/a2x-faq.html)
* EmacsListen
* ShortTalk
* JohnWiegley has http://www.gci-net.com/users/j/johnw/Emacs/obsolete/dictation.el
* http://www.codevox.com/alsopbvkit.phtml - with a downloadable kit [returns 404, right now, 9. okt. 2005]

* VoiceCode

=== Microphones ===
* It is very important to have a very good noise-canceling microphone.   One source I have come across is the compatibility list of (the NON-FREE) dragon naturally speaking software -- go for the few that meet their highest rating (six stars).
