I'm a software project manager. My goal is to use Emacs as much as possible in all my daily tasks because learning new environments each time I use a new programming language is very boring.

Currently using the following Emacs version : 
   GNU Emacs 22.2.1 (i386-mingw-nt5.1.2600) of 2008-03-26 on RELEASE
