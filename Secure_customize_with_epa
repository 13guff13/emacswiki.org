= Securing Customize with EPA =

If you use customize you find that you're storing all sorts of stuff in it, window size and positions but also passwords and other secure stuff.

A nice way of dealing with this problem is to just secure your config with GPG and EPA.

The first thing you have to do is [[http://www.dewinter.com/gnupg_howto/english/GPGMiniHowto-3.html#ss3.1|make a GPG key]]:

{{{
gpg --gen
}}}

In your {{{init.el}}} you can set the variable {{{custom-file}}} to a gpg file which you can then load. Here's what I have:

{{{
(load-file
 (setq custom-file
       (concat
        (file-name-directory
         (or
          (buffer-file-name)
          load-file-name))
        "nic-custom.el.gpg")))
}}}

You need to evaluate that to set the {{{custom-file}}} variable and unless the file exists it might error.

To ensure that EPA uses your GPG key you have to open the GPG'd file and add the following comment:

{{{
;;   -*- epa-file-encrypt-to: ("your.key.id@whatever") -*-
}}}

You might have to save that file and then open it again to make it select the correct key.

Before you restart Emacs you should:

{{{
M-: (custom-save-all)
}}}

which will force your customizations to be saved in the new file.

Now, when you start Emacs it will ask you for your GPG key password and then load the customizations from your custom file.
