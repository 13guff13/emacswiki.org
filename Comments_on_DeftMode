Hi.  When I use deft, it correctly shows all of my files, but doesn't filter at all once I start typing text.  I can see what I am typing showing up after "Deft: " on the first line, but the list of files never changes.

GNU Emacs 24.2.1 (i386-mingw-nt6.1.7601)
 of 2012-08-28 on MARVIN

My config:

(require 'deft)
(setq deft-extension "txt")
(setq deft-directory "~/../../notes")
(setq deft-use-filename-as-title t)
(global-set-key [f8] 'deft)

Any ideas?

Thanks!
