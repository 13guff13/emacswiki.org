This page is about '''[::Emacs Speaks Statistics]''', also sometimes called EmacsStatisticalSystem, but usually called '''[::ESS]'''. As always, you can click the page heading to list all pages related to ESS.

ESS is a package that integrates various statistical software with Emacs. S, R (a free implementation of S), Stata, and SAS modes are all supported by ESS, making it possible to hook writing and programming in Emacs right into your stats. It's pretty slick.
