The whole taxonomy of the various types of variables is clear as mud for a noob like me.

official definition: Customizable variables, also called user options, are global Lisp variables whose values can be set through the Customize interface (HH +faces)

From official "NEWS" page for 24.3:

			** Docstrings starting with `*' no longer indicate user options.
			Only variables defined using `defcustom' are considered user options.
			The function `user-variable-p' is now an obsolete alias for`custom-variable-p'.

For a start, this changes the "odd definition" on this wiki page.

	Elsewhere there is a comment that the last statement above is not true:
		‘user-variable-p’ corresponds to ‘set-variable’
		‘custom-variable-p’ corresponds to ‘customize-variable’

So is the ‘user-variable-p’ set a superset of ALL variables or orthogonal to user options?
	and does ‘custom-variable-p’ give the user options list based on the old '*' docstring method or the new (defvar vs defcustom) one?

----------------
I'm trying to build up my understanding from the POV of "how do I get a global list of X-type variables?" - them's that know please confirm/clarify/correct.

ALL variables
	M-x describe-var RET, TAB
	also set-variable, find-variable

above should be the superset
	
	customize-option         (M-x customize-option, also on the menu-bar)
		custom-variable-p
	
	user-variable-p
		
	(from obsolete options.el)
		M-x list-options
