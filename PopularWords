This mode warns you if you use any word that is not one of the 1000 or 2000 most popular words. There are two separate modes based on `text-mode' that do nothing except mark the most popular words using the `default' face. Everything else is highlighted in the `error' face.

The list of words is from the 2000 most frequent words from the Brown Corpus (1,015,945 words) and taken [http://www.edict.biz/lexiconindex/frequencylists/words2000.htm from this website].
