This extension sets the tags table(s) based on the current file (inspired by XEmacs' etags handling).  `etags-table-alist' is a list of lists, where the car of each sublist is compared to the current filename.  If it matches, all the rest of the list elements are put on `tags-table-list'.  If `etags-table-search-up-depth' is an integer, the file path will be searched upwards for a [[tags file]].  If one is found, it will be added to the tags table list; this is actually done first so the local TAGS file is at the head of the list.

When you switch files and do something tag-related, the tags table list is automatically recomputed.

== Installing with XEmacs compatibility == 

In XEmacs the `etags-table-alist' is actually called `tag-table-alist' and XEmacs will search up directories to find the TAGS file, so to ensure compatible emulation of XEmacs functionality you'd have to do the following:

{{{
(require 'etags-table)
(setq tag-table-alist 
      '(("~/.emacs.d/" . "~/.emacs.d/TAGS")
        ("~/projects/source/" . "~/.TAGS/projects.tags")))
(setq etags-table-alist tag-table-alist)
(setq etags-table-search-up-depth 10)
}}}
