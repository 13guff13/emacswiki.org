[http://http://arduino.cc/ Arduino] is "an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for artists, designers, hobbyists, and anyone interested in creating interactive objects or environments."

The Arduino IDE is useful for beginners, but Emacs is better.

* [https://github.com/bookest/arduino-mode arduino-mode.el] - major mode for editing .ino and .pde files.
* CEDET (CollectionOfEmacsDevelopmentEnvironmentTools) supports Arduino sketch projects, enabling compilation and uploading sketches to your microcontroller.

To compile sketches outside of the Arduino IDE, you will need to use [http://mjo.tc/atelier/2009/02/arduino-cli.html Arduino.mk] which is comes with the Arduino development environment.  This enables command line compilation of you sketches, and is used by the CEDET support.
