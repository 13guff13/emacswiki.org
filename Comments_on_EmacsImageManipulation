This is a nice addition to emacs. I had difficulty getting it to work initially because emacs could not find mogrify.  This was because of the setting of the variable eimp-mogrify-program.  eimp.el describes the variable as:

"Name of mogrify program. Should be in PATH."

I used <code>(setq eimp-mogrify-program "/usr/local/bin/mogrify")</code> in my .emacs file to get it to work.
