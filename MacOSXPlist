[http://edward.oconnor.cx/elisp/osx-plist.el osx-plist.el] is an Emacs lisp parser for MacOSX's plist files.

If you'd like Emacs to update its environment based on the contents of ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist, install this library and add the following to your .emacs file:

 (require 'osx-plist)
 (osx-plist-update-environment)

Share and Enjoy!
