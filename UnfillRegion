Unfilling a region joins all the lines in a paragraph into a single
line for each paragraphs in that region. It is the contrary of
##fill-region##, and the idea is based on UnfillParagraph.

You can convert an entire buffer from paragraphs to lines by recording
a macro that calls `unfill-paragraph' and moves past the blank-line to
the next unfilled paragraph and then executing that macro on the whole
buffer, `C-u 0 C-x e' (see InfiniteArgument). Or, use `unfill-region',
below.

    (defun unfill-region (beg end)
      "Unfill the region, joining text paragraphs into a single
    logical line.  This is useful, e.g., for use with
    `visual-line-mode'."
      (interactive "*r")
      (let ((fill-column (point-max)))
        (fill-region beg end)))
    
    ;; Handy key definition
    (define-key global-map "\C-\M-Q" 'unfill-region)

For those that needs those functions, they are in the file ##util/ourcomments-util.el## in [NxhtmlMode nXhtml]. You can grab that file from the repository if you like. (But I think the functions should be in Emacs so we do not have to reinvent them so often as we do now ...)

I do this all the time with the cumbersome ##C-x f 999 M-q##. Thanks for the tip.

Perhaps you meant `C-x f 999 M-x fill-region'?  The ''unfill'' version of `M-q' is at UnfillParagraph. -- AaronHawley
