Unfilling a region joins all the lines in a paragraph into a single line for each paragraphs in that region. It is the contrary of fill-region and the idea is based on UnfillParagraph.

    (defun unfill-region (from to)
      "Takes a region containing multi-line, hard wrapped, paragraphs and joins each paragraph into a

      (interactive (progn
                     (barf-if-buffer-read-only)
                     (list (region-beginning) (region-end))))
      (let ((fill-column (point-max)))
        (fill-region from to)))

For those that needs those functions they are in the file util/ourcomments-util.el in [NxhtmlMode nXhtml]. You can grab that file from the repository if you like.
(But I think the functions should be in Emacs so we do not have to reinvent them so often as we do now...)
