Unfilling a region joins all the lines in a paragraph into a single line for each paragraphs in that region. It is the contrary of ##fill-region##, and the idea is based on UnfillParagraph.

    (defun unfill-region (beg end)
      "Unfill the region, joining text paragraphs into a single logical line.
    This is useful, e.g., for use with `visual-line-mode'."
      (interactive "*r")
      (let ((fill-column (point-max)))
        (fill-region beg end)))

For those that needs those functions, they are in the file ##util/ourcomments-util.el## in [NxhtmlMode nXhtml]. You can grab that file from the repository if you like. (But I think the functions should be in Emacs so we do not have to reinvent them so often as we do now ...)

I do this all the time with the cumbersome ##C-x f 999 M-q##. Thanks for the tip.

Perhaps you meant `C-x f 999 M-x fill-region'?  The ''unfill'' version of `M-q' is at UnfillParagraph. -- AaronHawley
