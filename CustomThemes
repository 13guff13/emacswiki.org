Starting with version 23, vanilla GnuEmacs introduced '''[::custom theme]s'''.  See the Emacs manual (`C-h r'), node '''[[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Custom-Themes.html#Custom-Themes|Custom Themes]]'''.


[:ComparedToColorThemes]
=== Comparison with Color Themes ===

Custom themes are similar to '''[[ColorThemes|color themes]]'''.  Though they are newer, they do not ''replace'' color themes â€“- each approach has its advantages.  Differences between them include:

* Custom themes have a [[Customize]] interface (starting with Emacs 24); color themes do not.

* Custom themes record some additional information ([[variable]]s), besides color-schemes ([[face]]s etc).

* You can easily ''undo'' color themes, even returning to the state Emacs was in before you applied any themes.  You can take a snapshot of
the current settings (independent of how they were set, whether via
color themes or not) as something that can function as a (pseudo) color theme, which you can return to.  You '''[[http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=15687|cannot undo]]''' the application of custom themes, to return to the state before applying a theme.  You can only ''disable'' custom themes, not undo to a ''non-theme'' state.  That is, you can swap one custom theme for another, but any non-theme state before applying a custom theme is lost.

* Custom themes have some [[http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=15740|performance problems]].  Switching among them can be problematic.


=== History ===

'''Custom themes''' were first implemented in [[XEmacs]] sometime before 2002 - the idea was to extend the Customization library to handle themes. They were ported to Emacs and made part of the distribution sometime before 2005 - the '''color themes''' library was popular at the time but apparently didn't interact well with the Customization interface... and so, there are two different theme libraries.
