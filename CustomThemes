Starting with version 23, vanilla GnuEmacs introduced '''[::custom theme]s''', which are similar to ColorThemes. Emacs 24 added a [[Customize]] interface for custom themes.

'''Custom themes''' are similar to '''color themes''', but:

* Emacs (24+) provides a Customize interface for custom themes.

* You cannot ''undo'' the application of custom themes, to return to the state before applying a theme.  You can only ''disable'' custom themes, not undo to a non-theme state.  That is, you can swap one custom theme for another, but any non-theme state before applying a custom theme is lost. With color themes, on the other hand, you can restore a pre-theme state.

* Custom themes have some [[http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=15740|performance problems]].
