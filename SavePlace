Purpose: When you visit a file, point goes to the last place where it was when you previously visited the same file.

To use it, turn it on in the options menu - "Save place in files between Sessions".

Alternatively, you could add the following to your InitFile:

[h2]For GNU Emacs 25.1 and newer versions[/h2]

{{{
(save-place-mode 1) 
}}}

Note that <code>saveplace</code> is auto-loaded by <code>save-place-mode</code>. So you do not need to explicitly require it.

[h2]For GNU Emacs 24.5 and older versions[/h2]

{{{
(require 'saveplace)
(setq-default save-place t)
}}}
Note that using <code>setq</code> will not do because the variable is buffer-local.

Your saved places are written to the file stored in the file specified by <code>save-place-file</code>. This defaults to <code>~/.emacs-places</code>. You may want to change it to keep your home directory uncluttered, for example:
{{{
(setq save-place-file "~/.emacs.d/saved-places")
}}}

If emacs is slow to exit after enabling saveplace, you may be running afoul of save-place-forget-unreadable-files. On exit, it checks that every loaded file is readable before saving its buffer position - potentially very slow if you use NFS.  
{{{
(setq save-place-forget-unreadable-files nil)
}}}
will restores emacs exit to nearly instantaneous.
