In the section 'One-Key Macros', the functions should read:

<pre>
    (defun toggle-kbd-macro-recording-on ()
      "One-key keyboard macros: turn recording on."
      (interactive)
      (define-key global-map (this-command-keys)
        'toggle-kbd-macro-recording-off)
      (start-kbd-macro nil))

    (defun toggle-kbd-macro-recording-off ()
      "One-key keyboard macros: turn recording off."
      (interactive)
      (define-key global-map (this-command-keys)
        'toggle-kbd-macro-recording-on)
      (end-kbd-macro))
</pre>

`events-to-keys' doesn't seem to be a real function.
