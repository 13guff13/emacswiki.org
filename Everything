[[http://www.voidtools.com/|Everything]] is a very fast and lightweight desktop search-engine
for MS Windows for finding files scattered around your hard discs
(see http://www.voidtools.com).
The EmacsLisp package [[everything.el]] provides a simple interface to access
Everything's search power via its ftp interface within Emacs.

##everything.el## can also integrate itself into 
[[FindFileAtPoint]]. So, whenever all other methods of ffap fail, let everything
try finding the file at point. Best used in combination with
the exquisite [[Icicles]] package.

Basic steps to setup:

      (add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/everything.el")
      (require 'everything)

Usage:

       M-x everything

Prompts for a query and let you choose one of the files returned by Everything and opens it.
