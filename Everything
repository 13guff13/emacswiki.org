Everything is a very fast and lightweight desktop search-engine
for Windows for finding files scattered around your hard discs
(see http://www.voidtools.com).
The package [[everything.el]] provides a simple interface to access
Everything's search power via its ftp interface within Emacs.

Everything.el can also integrate itself into find-file-at-point
aka [[FindFileAtPoint]]. So, whenever all other methods of ffap fail, let everything
try finding the file at point. Best used in combination with
the exquicit [[Icicles]] package.
