If you enjoy playing on a MUSH or a MUD, you need
a mode for it.  You can of course always use
telnet.  `M-x telnet' even.

But there are other alternatives -- mu.el and [[eMUDs]].  Some of us use Lisp:mudel.el written by JorgenSchaefer.

= mu.el =

Mu uses ComintMode to do its job.  This has the
added benefit of providing you with an entire
communication infrastructure.  MinibufferHistory,
moving between prompts, highlighting of SGR
(escape sequences controlling colors on a tty)
using AnsiColor, etc.

Use `mu-open' to open a new connection. This will create two buffers for you. One buffer is the mu connection buffer. All the output from the
host appears here. You can also type your commands here, but this will get confusing rather quickly as output gets added while your type.

That's when the other buffer, the mu input buffer, comes into play. Whatever you type there will get sent to the mu connection buffer as well. If
you do that, input and output will happen in two different buffers. 

The only important buffer is the mu connection buffer. The mu input buffer is just for convenience. You can create more mu input buffers
using `mu-input-buffer', or you can kill all mu input buffers. It doesn't matter. 

Before you can open new connections, you must customize `mu-worlds'. As soon as you have done that, use `mu-open' to play.

Get it from here:

* Lisp:mu.el

== colors ==

Use AnsiColor.  Here's how to install it in your ~/.emacs:

 (autoload 'mu-open "mu" "Play on MUSHes and MUDs" t)
 (add-hook 'mu-connection-mode-hook 'ansi-color-for-comint-mode-on)

== coding system ==

Switch to the output buffer and use `M-x mu-dos' if your host is sending you DOS line endings (ie. you have a ^M at the end of every line).  `set-process-coding-system' can be used to set output and input coding systems.
There is probably some smart way of adding this to `mu-connection-mode-hook'.

<pre>
(defun mu-dos ()
  "Set coding system of the current buffer's process to DOS."
  (interactive)
  (set-process-coding-system 
   (get-buffer-process (current-buffer))
		       'iso-latin-1-dos
		       'iso-latin-1-unix))
</pre>

I have this problem when playing on the Belerian Mush. -- AlexSchroeder
