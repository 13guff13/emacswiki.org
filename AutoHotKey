AutoHotkey is an open source scripting language for Windows that can automate and customize almost any action on your PC.
* Use virtually any key, button, or combination as a hotkey for your keyboard, mouse, joystick, and handheld remote controls.
* Expand abbreviations as you type them using hotstrings.
* Easily create your own graphical user interfaces and custom menus.
* Convert any script into an EXE file that will run on computers without AutoHotkey.
* Manipulate files, text, and windows belonging to almost any program.
* Call functions inside a DLL, such as standard Windows API functions.
* All of this and more in a simplified syntax that makes learning easy for beginners while offering powerful features for advanced users.

Now that I see the page you wrote, I'm not sure we need it on the wiki -- after all, if we have this page, why don't we have pages for GIMP, GNU/Linux, Slackware, Debian, GNU screen, mail, sendmail, Tex, and a myriad of other pages? Slowly, the Emacs Wiki will look like an incomplete and unmaintained software directory.

I think such a page should relate to Emacs is some way. In this particular case, we already have the page [[AutoHotKey Mode]] that says everything there is to say (from the point of view of an Emacs user who doesn't know what AutoHotKey is or does).

In short, I think we should replace all instances of ##AutoHotKey## with ##[http://www.autohotkey.com/wiki/ AutoHotKey]## and merge this page with [[AutoHotKey Mode]] (if necessary), and delete it. -- AlexSchroeder

I agree with the above from Jonas, except what I **would** like to see if not here then somewhere, is a HowTo make use of AHK to generalize the emacs keystrokes to the entire windoze environment.

So, on-topic for this page would be, e.g. information about how to use Autohotkey in conjunction with Emacs. I use the US keyboard layout, since I am a programmer, but I frequently need to type European diacritical characters when I write German or Swedish, or type my name. I have an Autohotkey setup with things like
<pre>
:*?:ae/::ä
</pre>
for all the diacriticals I use regularly. This doesn't work in Emacs though. Autohotkey sends ä to the receiving application by sending simulated keystrokes for Alt-keypad-0 Alt-keypad-2 Alt-keypad-2 Alt-keypad-8, which in most Windows applications generates the character with decimal code 0228, ä. Emacs doesn't support this, so I hacked together the equivalent functionality in Elisp:
<pre>
;; Hack to support Windows Alt+keypad to enter characters by numerical
;; code.  Needed to support insertion of European characters from
;; Autohotkey scripts.
(defvar jonas:alt-keypad-seq nil)
 
(defun jonas:alt-keypad-value (key)
  (case key
    (M-kp-0 0)
    (M-kp-1 1)
    (M-kp-2 2)
    (M-kp-3 3)
    (M-kp-4 4)
    (M-kp-5 5)
    (M-kp-6 6)
    (M-kp-7 7)
    (M-kp-8 8)
    (M-kp-9 9)))
 
(defun jonas:alt-keypad-translate (seq)
  (let ((acc 0))
    (dolist (elem seq acc)
      (setq acc (+ (jonas:alt-keypad-value elem)
                   (* 10 acc))))))
 
(defun jonas:alt-keypad ()
  ""
  (interactive)
  (unless (eq last-command 'jonas:alt-keypad)
    (setq jonas:alt-keypad-seq nil))
  (push last-command-char jonas:alt-keypad-seq)
  (if (= (length jonas:alt-keypad-seq) 4)
      (progn
        (ucs-insert (jonas:alt-keypad-translate (reverse jonas:alt-keypad-seq)))
        (setq  jonas:alt-keypad-seq nil))))
 
(global-set-key [M-kp-0] 'jonas:alt-keypad)
(global-set-key [M-kp-1] 'jonas:alt-keypad)
(global-set-key [M-kp-2] 'jonas:alt-keypad)
(global-set-key [M-kp-3] 'jonas:alt-keypad)
(global-set-key [M-kp-4] 'jonas:alt-keypad)
(global-set-key [M-kp-5] 'jonas:alt-keypad)
(global-set-key [M-kp-6] 'jonas:alt-keypad)

Another great thing about Autohotkey is that it allows you to remap the Caps Lock key, which is rather difficult in Windows. Just use
<pre>
CapsLock::AppsKey

</pre>
to make it a Super key---very useful in Emacs if you define your own keybindings.
