I've got a mind to move the comparisons with other languages to a EmacsLispLearning page.

Thoughts?

Sure

Not sure I agree with this Aaron, you've conflated the learning with the features - we still have people coming to EmacsLisp who are one of two types of people:

1. Lisp programmers who think they know what EmacsLisp is but don't
2. people who have no idea about Lisp programming

There's also a third group:

3. people who don't know ANY programming language

I agree that we could make it more clear which linked pages are more likely to be useful to which readers.

In addition, some typos were introduced with this edit.  E.g., non-sentence before the bullets (probably should be replaced with "See also" or some such); "see at the symbol glossary" (?).  IOW, some cleanup is needed.

Yeah, perhaps the straggling sentence was the reason for the confusion.

I see you fixed the first typo before my comment was posted.  Thx.

What do we think about that tutorial linked? There seems to be very little there. I don't see why we should link to that.
