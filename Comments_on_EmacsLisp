I've got a mind to move the comparisons with other languages to a EmacsLispLearning page.

Thoughts?

Not sure I agree with this Aaron, you've conflated the learning with the features - we still have people coming to EmacsLisp who are one of two types of people:

1. Lisp programmers who think they know what EmacsLisp is but don't
2. people who have no idea about Lisp programming

There's also a third group:

3. people who don't know ANY programming language
