I am [::erik] on EmacsChannel sometimes.

I use Emacs because it tastes great, is less filling.

: Hi Erik!  I just saw you uploaded a version of ctypes.el a while back.  Comparing it to the latest version we have in XEmacs packages CVS it looks as if you just introduced some typos (LispCtypesDiffs).  -- AdrianAichner

: Huh, weird.  That was just something I downloaded off of some webpage forever ago and noticed that emacswiki didn't have a copy.  Thanks for pointing it out; feel free to clean up the mess I've left behind :)  -- ErikBourget
