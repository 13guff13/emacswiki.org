This category is about packaging Emacs extension, or about utilities that can automate searching, downloading and installing extensions.

== Repositories ==

* [[ELPA]] -- Emacs Lisp Package Archive. This is the GNU the standard repository.
** [[MELPA]] -- an ELPA-compatible repository, built automatically on their server from upstream sources using recipes
** [[Marmalade]] -- an ELPA-compatible repository, where users upload their own packages
* [[DELPS]] -- Distributed Emacs Lisp Package System used by [[Epackage]].  Install [[Git]] packaged repositories.
* [[Emacsmirror]] -- Collects packages and distributes them as [[Git]] repositories.

There seem to be earlier efforts that have basically been obsoleted by the inclusion of [[ELPA]] into Emacs:

* EmacsLispList -- A long list of packages with summaries and links.  List packages using [http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/sje30/emacs/ell.el ell.el]

== Package Managers ==

Emacs 24 comes with a *built-in package manager* using [[ELPA]]: `M-x package-install'

Users on the EmacsChannel report the following alternatives still being used:

* [[el-get]] -- one regularly sees packages that claim to be available via el-get, but not via any ELPA-compatible repository

These seem to be earlier efforts that have basically been obsoleted by the inclusion of [[ELPA]] into Emacs:
