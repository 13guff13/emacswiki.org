CryptPlusPlus can also be used with GPG to automatically encrypt and decrypt buffers.

<pre>
;; crypt++ with gpg backend
(require 'crypt++)
(setq crypt-encryption-type 'gpg
      crypt-encryption-file-extension "\\(\\.gpg\\)$")
(modify-coding-system-alist 'file "\\.gpg\\'" 'no-conversion)
</pre>

I would be very pleased if someone else would like to take over maintenance of crypt++.  I do not have the inclination or expertise to work on it as I'd like to.  Just mail me, karl@cs.umb.edu.

== Encryption in emacs-wiki with crypt++ ==

Another approach is to encrypt files transparently with emacs-wiki. Place something like this in your .emacs:

<pre>
;; crypt++ - i use this in conjunction with emacs-wiki
(require 'crypt++)
(setq crypt-encryption-type 'mcrypt
      crypt-encryption-file-extension "\\(Secure\\)$\\|\\(\\.enc\\)$")
(setq emacs-wiki-ignored-extensions-regexp "\\.\\(bz2\\|gz\\|[Zz]\\|enc\\)\\'")
</pre>

All wiki links named with Secure at the end will now be transparently encoded and decoded. <nowiki>You can also name a wiki link as "FooBar", and rename the file on the filesystem to "FooBar.enc". Following the link to "FooBar" will now check to see if there is a FooBar.enc file.</nowiki>

I prefer to see whether a file is secured or not, though.
