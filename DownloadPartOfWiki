== Using wget ==

Wget can't be directly used to download a small region of emacswiki.org because the site has a robots.txt to exclude wget.

Here's a polite way around this barrier:

<pre>
wget --http-user=foo --http-pass=geheim --reject "*search=*","*action=*", \
"Comments*","RecentChanges" --html-extension --backup-converted \
--page-requisites --convert-links -e robots=off -w 4 -r -l5 -np <url>
</pre>

== Problems with PDF Files ==

##--html-extension## adds the html extension to some PDF files, since their MIME type is thought to be text/html.
This doesn't happen for all PDFs though.
