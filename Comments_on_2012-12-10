Maybe we can have some manual mechanism similar to the one for deleting a page? A human marks a page as outdated, this gets visually indicated on the page and references to such pages are automatically aggregated somewhere, so they can be reviewed (and hopefully updated) by interested parties?

Theoretically, searching for CategoryNeedsAttention should do it, I guess? (Based on EmacsWikiContent.)
