To report Emacs bugs, use '''`M-x report-emacs-bug'''' in Emacs -- simple as that.  Do not hesitate to report a bug. The Emacs developers will help you determine whether there is really a bug or not. 

When you report a bug, start with '''`##emacs -q --no-site-file##'''' (or just '''`##emacs -Q##'''' in recent Emacs versions), so that you do ''not'' load your [[init file]] or [[custom file]]. Then provide a ''precise recipe'' for reproducing the behavior you see, step by step. See the Emacs manual, node Bugs (Manual:Bugs) for more info. Without a complete recipe of what you did to see the bug behavior, it will be difficult for anyone to help you.

You can find previous bug report logs at http://emacsbugs.donarmstrong.com/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=emacs;repeatmerged=no (or in the mailing list archive at http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-emacs/). Please note that the practical instructions for reporting bugs at emacsbugs.donarmstrong.com is not correct yet - just use report-emacs-bug (see above) instead.

You can find bugs that were known at the time of distribution for your version of Emacs in file '''##PROBLEMS##''' in directory '''##etc##''' of your Emacs installation -- for example,  ##/usr/share/emacs/21.4/##<tt>__etc/PROBLEMS__</tt>.

**If you want things to get better then send bug reports. Those
who are going to fix the problems are not going to look here!** Please do not add reports of random bugs and work-arounds to this page.
