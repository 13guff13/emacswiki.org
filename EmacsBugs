To report Emacs bugs, use '''`M-x report-emacs-bug'''' in Emacs -- simple as that.  Do not hesitate to report a bug. The Emacs developers will help you determine whether there is really a bug or not. 

When you report a bug, start with '''`##emacs -q --no-site-file##'''' (or just '''`##emacs -Q##'''' in recent Emacs versions), so that you do ''not'' load your [[init file]] or [[custom file]]. Then provide a ''precise recipe'' for reproducing the behavior you see, step by step. See the Emacs manual, node Bugs (Manual:Bugs) for more info. Without a complete recipe of what you did to see the bug behavior, it will be difficult for anyone to help you.

Search the EmacsBugTracker to make sure your bug hasn't been reported already (or in the mailing list archive of [[bug-gnu-emacs]]).

You can find bugs that were known at the time of distribution for your version of Emacs in file '''##PROBLEMS##''' in directory '''##etc##''' of your Emacs installation -- for example,  ##/usr/share/emacs/21.4/##<tt>__etc/PROBLEMS__</tt>.

* If you want things to get better then send bug reports.
* Those who are going to fix the problems are not going to look here!
* Please do not add reports of random bugs and work-arounds to this page.
