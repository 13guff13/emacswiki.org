[[es:PclCvsEs]]
[::pcvs]
or [::PclCvs], is a mode for interacting with multiple files in a [[CVS]] repository.  `pcvs' comes shipped with Emacs 21 and later.  XEmacs has had it for a longer time.

[[CVS]] was one of the first free and widely used revision control systems that could manage groups of files and entire directory trees, rather than just one file at a time like predecessor systems, [[RCS]] and CSSC.  The design of Emacs' VersionControl mode unfortunately only supports these single-file operations.  PclCvs was the first Emacs mode to support aggregate operations on CVS files.

pcvs启动: ##`M-x cvs-status RET <directory> RET'##

Note that `pcvs' can usefully coexist with the traditional VersionControl mode; there is no need to pick one over the other, as they perform quite distinct functions.
