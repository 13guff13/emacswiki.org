Visual line mode is a new mode in Emacs 23 that is on by default.  According to the ##NEWS## file,

    Visual Line mode provides support for editing by visual lines.
    It turns on word-wrapping in the current buffer, and rebinds C-a, C-e,
    and C-k to commands that operate by visual lines instead of logical
    lines.  This is a more reliable replacement for longlines-mode.
    This can also be turned on using the menu bar, via
    Options -> Line Wrapping in this Buffer -> Word Wrap

To use the original behavior put the following in your .emacs:

    (setq line-move-visual nil)

This mode will likely deprecate LongLines in a future version of Emacs.

See also LineWrap.

I turned it on globally with `(global-visual-line-mode 1)' and it's really useful. But I also use iswitchb which shows the buffer list in multiple lines in the minibuffer if there are lots of open buffers. That's how I like it. The problem is visual line mode wraps lines in the minibuffer too which is not good, because it breaks the nice iswitchb display.

Is there a way to turn it on globally, but disable it in the minibuffer? I tried this, but it didn't seem to do the trick:


    (add-hook 'minibuffer-setup-hook (lambda ()
                                       (visual-line-mode -1)))

You may want to ask [[help-gnu-emacs]].  An conflict between global visual line mode and Iswitchb may be a bug.

Concerning your workaround(?), note that `iswitchb-minibuffer-setup-hook' may be more appropriate, and you may also want to just try setting `line-move-visual' to nil, then setting it back with `minibuffer-exit-hook'.  So something along the lines of.

    (add-hook 'iswitchb-minibuffer-setup-hook
	      (lambda ()
		(setq line-move-visual nil)))
    
    (add-hook 'minibuffer-exit-hook (lambda ()
				      (setq line-move-visual t)))

This is just an untested guess on what to also try, so no guarantees that it will work. -- AaronHawley

Tried your suggestion. Unfortunately, it doesn't help. The problem is the same.
