I'm sure we don't like drive-by questions but I don't see how there are going to be any consequences for people who left the channel. Unless this document is going to turn into a general IRC netiquette thing. :)

Is this a proper channel to ask a question? I can't get emacs to run remotely and display on my local X window DISPLAY. xeyes works, emacs will only open in terminal/text mode. I have an ssh connection from my windows desktop to amazon linux server, with X11 port forwarding enabled - hence xeyes does work. What am I missing? Thanks, Mike.
