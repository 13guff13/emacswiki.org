The `completing-read' function (see [[Manual:Minibuffer Completion]] (lisp) in the manual) enables you to prompt the user to select from a collection of options, using minibuffer completion to narrow and select the desired option.

The [InteractivelyDoThings Ido] library provides an analogous `ido-completing-read' which does the same thing using the ido interface.

Advanced libraries such as [[Icicles]] and [EmacsWiki:id=Anything Anything/Helm] also provide their own completion interfaces.

==Customised completing-read functionality==

* AutoCompletingRead provides variants of `completing-read' and `ido-completing-read' designed to minimise the number of keystrokes needed to select an option by automatically completing as much as possible, and automatically selecting when only one option remains.
