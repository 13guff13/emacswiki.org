I would probably just move this page to DuckDuckGo. To me, a category is like a section of a library. If there is but one thing being talked about, it doesn't need it's separate category. There is a category IRC, for exampl, but just one rcirc page---even if there a plenty of rcirc libraries with their separate pages. Ere are no clear cut criteria, however.

FWIW, I agree with Alex, though I don't know much about duck duck go.

Done!

This page should also be marked for deleting or it is deleted automatically?
