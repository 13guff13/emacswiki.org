The Emacsmirror *collects* Emacs Lisp packages and *distributes* them in
form of [[Git]] repositories --- one per package.  Additionally *metadata*
is extracted from the packages and made available in human and machine
readable formats.

This is an *alpha release*.

Please see the projects [http://github.com/emacsmirror/p/wiki homepage] for more
information.  I also used to maintain a nicer [http://www.emacsmirror.org homepage]
with pages for each package, but that is currently not being updated.

== Mirroring the Emacswiki ==

Most of the packages from the EmacsWiki are being mirrored like packages
distributed elsewhere.  A few have have been left out for various reasons.

The respective repositories on the mirror contain the full history
beginning with the 30th August 2009 though the commit messages are just
timestamps.

You might also be interested in the [[Git repository]] which mirrors all
pages and files from the EmacsWiki.

== Contributing ==

You can contribute to the mirror by reporting new packages.

If you maintain some packages yourself please check if the *most* *recent*
versions are being mirrored.  (Some packages have been imported manually
because I could not find upstream.  In this case new versions won't be
mirrored automatically.)  Otherwise [mailto:jonas@emacsmirror.org inform]
me where they can be found.

Of course you don't actually need to be it's maintainer to report where
some missing package can be found.

== Discussion ==

Please feel free to discuss this project here or send
[mailto:jonas@emacsmirror.org me] an email.  Instead of sending me
emails about missing packages you may also report them here.

The list of missing packages that used to be here has been removed.  Many
packages have since been imported; even from http://www.archive.org/. The
rest probably isn't worth making yet another effort to locate them.
