== Configuration by Users ==

RubikitchAnythingConfiguration is my anything configuration. -- [[rubikitch]]

See also Lisp:AnythingConfigThierryVolpiatto.el

AndyStewart has added some cool extensions : Lisp:anything-extension.el

== Tips ==

=== Only existing files in "File Name History" ===

anything.el defines "File Name History" by default, personally, I don't want to see non-existant files (I branch loads) so I just use this to modify the default:

<pre>
;; have file name history keep out non-existant files
(let ((source (find-if
               (lambda (s)
                 (string= (cdr (assoc 'name s)) "File Name History"))
               anything-sources)))
  (setcdr (assoc 'candidates source)
          (lambda ()
            (remove-if-not 'file-exists-p file-name-history))))
</pre>

=== Stop frame from repositioning (eg. in Aquamacs fullscreen mode) === 
When using M-x aquamacs-toogle-full-frame, and then M-x anything, the frame position is shifted some pixels to the left, which hides part of the frame. If you don't want this to happen, simply put

  (setq fit-frame-inhibit-fitting-flag t)

in your .emacs.

=== Show completions in a separate frame ===
This code creates an extra frame when invoking anything. It's not that sophisticated as I'm just learning elisp. I have configured my window manager to show this frame centered. it would probably be nice if this can be done by emacs. I also tried to set _NET_WM_STATE_SKIP_TASKBAR via x-send-client-message, but it seems it needs to be send from the frame that should be changed (or at least it doesnt work with my wm otherwise)
<pre>
(defvar anything-frame nil)

(defun anything-initialize-frame ()
  (unless (and anything-frame (frame-live-p anything-frame))
    (setq anything-frame (make-frame '((name . "*Anything*") 
				       (width . 80) 
				       (height . 40)))))
  (select-frame anything-frame)

  (set-window-buffer (frame-selected-window anything-frame) 
		     (get-buffer-create anything-buffer)))

(defun anything-hide-frame ()
  (when (and anything-frame (frame-live-p anything-frame))
    (iconify-frame anything-frame)))

(add-hook 'anything-after-initialize-hook 
	  'anything-initialize-frame)

(add-hook 'anything-cleanup-hook 
	  'anything-hide-frame)
</pre>

== Implemented ==

=== Start anything with the symbol at point ===

The following function launches anything with a default search of the symbol at point (using thing-at-point). A "symbol" is an extended word. I attach anything to F11 and anything-at-point to shift-F11.

<pre> 
(defun anything-at-point ()
  "Start anything with the symbol at point"
  (interactive)
  (anything nil (thing-at-point 'symbol)))
(global-set-key [\S-f11] 'anything-at-point)
</pre> 

[new:rubikitch:2009-03-23 19:06 UTC]
This feature is already implemented in the latest version.
Bind `anything-at-point' instead of `anything' and execute C-u M-x anything-at-point.

=== Testing Sources ===
[new:AndyStewart:2009-02-24 13:45 UTC]
This code have add in Lisp:anything-config.el -- AndyStewart

<code>anything-test-sources</code> inserts <code>setq</code>s for all <code>anything-source-*</code>.
It will facilitate testing sources. -- [[rubikitch]]

  (defun anything-test-sources ()
    (interactive)
    (switch-to-buffer "*scratch*")
    (goto-char (point-max))
    (insert "\n")
    (save-excursion
      (insert 
       "(setq anything-sources-old anything-sources)\n"
       "(setq anything-sources anything-sources-old)\n"
       (mapconcat (lambda (sym) (format "(setq anything-sources (list %s))" sym))
                  (apropos-internal "^anything-c-source" #'boundp)
                  "\n"))))
