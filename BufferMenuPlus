Library <tt>[[buff-menu+.el]]</tt> ('''[::BufferMenu+]''') provides the following enhancements to the standard BufferMenu:

* A new column, '''Time''', which is the time that a buffer was last accessed (displayed).  Short and long time formats (option). (Emacs 22 or later.)
* You can selectively ''hide'' any of the columns '''Time''', '''Mode''', and '''File''', using user options or toggle commands.  This is useful to save horizontal space. (Emacs 22 or later.)
* You can use `##+##' and `##-##' to increase and decrease the '''Buffer''' and '''Size''' column widths. (Emacs 22 or later.)
* You can sort ''up or down'' by clicking any column heading. The sorted column and its sort order (ascending, descending) are indicated by ''highlighting'' (underlining, overlining). (Emacs 22 or later.)
* You can [[Customize|customize]] which column to sort by default using [[option]]
'''`Buffer-menu-sort-column''''.
* Clicking column heading '''CRM''' sorts the buffers by time of ''first'' access (visit). This is not the same thing as a descending sort of '''Time''', which is the time of ''last'' access (display). If you have many buffers (especially if they have similar names), sorting by one of these columns can be useful. (Emacs 22 or later.)
* You can customize the default sort column. (Emacs 22 or later.)
* Buttons in header columns are wider, so easier to click. (Emacs 22 or later.)
* A ''mouse popup menu'' (`mouse-3') was added, providing these menu items:
** '''Select Buffer'''
** '''Unmark Buffer'''
** '''Mark to Save Buffer (S)'''
** '''Mark to Delete Buffer (D)'''
** '''Mark as Modified/Unmodified (*)'''
** '''Execute: Save/Delete Marked Buffers'''
** '''Delete All <nowiki>`D'</nowiki>, Even If Modified'''
* That last `mouse-3' menu item is a new command, `Buffer-menu-delete-flagged' (bound to `C-M-x'), that deletes all buffers flagged `D', even if they are modified.
* Command `buffer-menu' was redefined so that:
** A prefix argument zero or less means list buffers ''alphabetically''.
** A prefix argument zero or more means list only ''Dired and file buffers''.
* The buffer-menu buffer (<code>*Buffer List*</code>) is font-lock ''highlighted'':
** Each field of buffer (Buffer, Mode, File etc.) uses a different [[face]].
** Each mark uses a different face (Save, Delete, Read-Only, Mark, Current). All faces (there are eleven) are user-definable (variables).
* The buffer lines have the `mouse-face' property on the whole line, so you can click it anywhere.
* Command `Buffer-menu-execute' (<code>x</code>) deletes all windows that show a buffer, when it kills the buffer.
* Command `Buffer-menu-select' (<code>v</code>) uses `pop-to-buffer' when the <code>*Buffer List*</code> window is `window-dedicated-p'.
* Bug fix: In Emacs 21, if buffer <code>*Buffer List*</code> is a special-display buffer (for instance, if you set `special-display-regexps' to match buffer names "*...*"), then you cannot revert the buffer or sort on a column by clicking its header. (This is fixed in Emacs 22.)

Here is a screenshot of the <code>*Buffer List*</code> buffer in Emacs 20:

: [[image:DrewsEmacsBufferMenu]].

Here is a screenshot of it in Emacs 22, showing the new time-last-accessed column and highlighting (underlining) of the sorted column.

: [[image:DrewsEmacsBufferMenuSorted]].

Both of these screenshots are a bit old. Now, different kinds of buffers (directory, `##*...*##' name, normal) are highlighted differently, and the buffer name is also highlighted specially when you mark or flag a buffer.

== Search All Marked Buffers using Icicles ==

With [[Icicles]], you can use '''`M-s i'''' in Buffer Menu to search all marked buffers  and possibly replace search hits.  You have
available all of the [[Icicles - Search Commands, Overview|Icicles Search]] features, including accessing search hits directly, in any order.

Buffer Menu+ looks very useful. But please, /please/ use PNG for screenshots, not JPEG.[http://lbrandy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/jpg_vs_png2.png]

Both ##buff-menu+.el## and recent versions (Sept. 8/2004) of ##buff-menu.el## call the function /format-mode-line/. Any ideas where it can be found? Thanks. -- SteveTaylor

I'm experiencing issues when some buffers are in some nxml-derivative mode (html, xml ...). After calling list-buffers, the "buffer list" window gets updated until first nxml-typed buffer. Gets interrupted (backtrace buffer pops up), (wrong-type-argument characterp sgml-xml-mode) at the top of the backtrace, full spit is available at http://gist.github.com/458598 . Switching back the nxml buffers to text-mode works around the issue. 
Experiencing this issue since E23.0, now at 23.2.1, I believe this may have something to do with buffer-menu+. -- elie

Your backtrace suggests that the problem is in `bs', not in <tt>[[buff-menu+.el]]</tt>.  The code in the backtrace is all from `bs.el', it seems.
 
<pre>
Debugger entered--Lisp error: (wrong-type-argument characterp sgml-xml-mode)
  concat("         " (sgml-xml-mode "XHTML" "HTML"))
  (if (eq (quote right) align) (concat (make-string ... 32) string) 
  (concat string (make-string ... 32)))  (if (>= length len) string (if (eq ... align)
  (concat ... string) (concat string ...)))
  (let ((length ...)) (if (>= length len) string (if ... ... ...)))
  bs--format-aux((sgml-xml-mode "XHTML" "HTML") right 12)
</pre>

Something is passing ##'(sgml-xml-mode "XHTML" "HTML")## to `concat'.  It tries to process that list as a list of chars, which it is not (it is a list of a symbol and two strings). -- DrewAdams

Buffer-Menu+ does not work with Emacs 24. Anyone know of any plans to make it do so? -- ScottRandby

[new:DrewAdams:2011-12-29 07:10 UTC]
1. Emacs 24 has not been released.  I don't claim to support at present.  

2. That said, it works for me.

3. Be specific about what problem you think you see.  "''Does not work''" does not help.  Provide a recipe to reproduce the problem, preferably from ##emacs -Q##. Send a bug report by clicking the '''Send Bug Report''' link in the `Buffer-Menu-Plus' `customize-group' buffer.  -- DrewAdams

[new]
I'm very sorry for not being more specific. I downloaded v21 update 2742 of ##buff-menu+.el## and now it works perfectly. I was using v21 update 2716 and the following message appeared in the minibuffer whenever I did ##C-x C-b## from ##emacs -Q##.

<pre>
Wrong type argument: characterp, 8388640
</pre>

I am using Emacs 24 because Emacs 23.3 won't compile on Xubuntu 11.10 without a lot of work and I don't want to use the version in the repository. It would be nice if ##buff-menu+## was part of GNU Emacs. -- ScottRandby

I am using version 21.0, update 2742 of ##buff-menu+.el## on GNU Emacs 24.0.92.1. When I don't have the package loaded and do ##M-x buffer-menu## and sort the buffer menu by file, I get the following (which is what I want).

<pre>
Directory1
File1
Directory2
File2
*scratch*
*Message*
</pre>

If I load ##buff-menu+.el## and sort the buffer menu by file (ascending), I get this (which I don't want):

<pre>
File1
File2
*scratch*
*Message*
Directory1
Directory2
</pre>

Older versions of ##buff-menu+.el## that I used with Emacs 23 sorted files the first way. Has file sorting been changed? If so, is there any way that file sorting can be done the first way? -- ScottRandby

[new:DrewAdams:2012-01-05 14:19 UTC]
I cannot reproduce the problem.  If you are talking about sorting by file/dir name, then that still works (for me) the same as always: the file and dir names are sorted lexicographically (alphabetically), either ascending or descending.  File and dir names are treated the same.

Anyway, the lists you show here are ''not'' file/dir names -- they are ''buffer'' names.  By sorting by ''file'' name I assume you mean just that, which you do by clicking the '''File''' column header.

Perhaps I'm misunderstanding you.  Please elaborate/clarify.  Thx -- DrewAdams

[new]
Yes, the names are buffer names and the sort is done when I click on the '''File''' column header. So what is happening is that all the buffer names associated with files appear at the top of the list and all the buffer names associated with directories appear at the bottom of the list when ##buff-menu+.el## is loaded. Does this help?
