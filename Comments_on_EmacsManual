When the manual entry you want to refer to contains a space, you need to use double square brackets:

{{{
* [[Manual:Circular Objects|Circular Stuff]]
* [[Manual:Circular Objects]]
}}}

Result:

* [[Manual:Circular Objects|Circular Stuff]]
* [[Manual:Circular Objects]]

Thanks! Btw we discussed this on #emacs.

jlf said he thought it would be a good idea if the manual links explained how to find that manual in Emacs. Sachac and I suggested it could be done via an intermediary page containing instructions on how to get to the manual on your machine.

So the manual cgi could redirect to the display of a page (an SSI?) containing the instructions and a link to the page. Perhaps the link would autodirect if you had a cookie set.

Anyway, people thought this was quite a good idea but recognized how much dev it was. I said I would consider writing it with ElWiki but that I'd mention it on the existing Wiki.
