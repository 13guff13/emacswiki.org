CopyeditMode is a minor mode to tweak Emacs to edit English prose in a do-what-I-mean manner.  It aims to automate drudgery and minimize keystrokes.  You should be able to kill a word without worrying about leftover spaces or punctuation marks, or where it should be capitalized.  Copyedit handles this for you.  It also redefines the behavior of some commands in ways that better suit prose.  Most changes done to a word while editing are done to the beginning or end of the word—changes inside the word are usually misspellings—so forward-word and backward-word are remapped to commands that alternate between the beginning and end of words.  Some useful new commands are also provided.  Some are logical extensions, like `backward-kill-copyedit-sentence' (kill from point to beginning of sentence).  Some provide new functionality, like 'copyedit-drag-region' or 'copyedit-depunctuate.'  New commands, however, are not bound by default; customize `copyedit-bind-extra-keys' to `t' to use them.
