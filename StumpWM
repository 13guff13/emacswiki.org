[http://www.nongnu.org/stumpwm/ Stumpwm] is the emacs of window managers.  If you're using it, you'll want to put a few thing in your .stumpwmrc.

== SLIME ==

Add this code to your .stumpwmrc for interactive control of stumpwm via slime:
{{{
;; Load swank.
;; C-z ; swank will kick this off
(load "/path/to/slime/swank-loader.lisp")
(swank-loader:init)
(defcommand swank () ()
  (setf stumpwm:*top-level-error-action* :break)
  (swank:create-server :port 4005
                       :style swank:*communication-style*
                       :dont-close t)
  (echo-string (current-screen) 
	       "Starting swank. M-x slime-connect RET RET, then (in-package stumpwm)."))
(swank)
}}}

== Controlling emacs through stumpwm commands ==

This is an example of how you can use stumpwm commands to call emacs functions.
{{{
(defcommand wanderlust () ()
	    (emacs)
	    (send-meta-key (current-screen) (kbd "M-x"))
	    (window-send-string "wl")
	    (send-meta-key (current-screen) (kbd "RET")))
}}}
