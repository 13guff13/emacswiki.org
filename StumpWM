[http://www.nongnu.org/stumpwm/ Stumpwm] is the Emacs of window managers.  If you're using it, you'll want to put a few thing in your .stumpwmrc.

== SLIME ==

If you've enabled multi-threading, add this code to your .stumpwmrc for interactive control of Stumpwm via Slime:
{{{
;; Load swank.
;; *prefix-key* ; swank will kick this off
(load "/path/to/slime/swank-loader.lisp")
(swank-loader:init)
(defcommand swank () ()
  (setf stumpwm:*top-level-error-action* :break)
  (swank:create-server :port 4005
                       :style swank:*communication-style*
                       :dont-close t)
  (echo-string (current-screen) 
	       "Starting swank. M-x slime-connect RET RET, then (in-package stumpwm)."))
(swank)
}}}

Multi-threading is available in SBCL, though [[http://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=434724#p434724 not in CLisp]].  Running Swank (or any other command that doesn't fork or exit) on a single-threaded StumpWM will hang StumpWM.  You'll be able to move the mouse, but the prefix key won't react anymore.  You'll have to Ctrl+Alt+Backspace to start a new session.  You can still hack using the StumpWM Eval functionality though.

== Controlling emacs through stumpwm commands ==

This is an example of how you can use stumpwm commands to call emacs functions.
{{{
(defcommand wanderlust () ()
	    (emacs)
	    (send-meta-key (current-screen) (kbd "M-x"))
	    (window-send-string "wl")
	    (send-meta-key (current-screen) (kbd "RET")))
}}}
