I haven't checked recently, but it's always worked fine out of the box.

---------------------------------------------------------

I've just downloaded emacs-21.4 leim-21.4 unpacked them
gone to cmd shell on Windows XP

> vcvars32.bat
> cd emacs-21.4/nt
> ./configure
> nmake
> nmake install INSTALL_DIR=c:\pf\emacs

and voi la! emacs is running.
