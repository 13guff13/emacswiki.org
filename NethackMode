Features include customizable keys, hooks on game events, customizable colors, run-time switching between text and glyphs, and all the beauty that comes with emacs.

Nethack-el also requires a patched version of nethack. The patch comes with the nethack-el package and adds an additional window port to nethack. This 'lisp' port is a serialization of the nethack window port interface and can be used for more than just a lisp port. In the CVS version you can also play over the internet.
