= This is the Emacs Wiki =

This page has meta information about the Emacs Wiki.  See the SiteMap
for entry points.

* See the HowTo page for information on editing existing pages or adding new ones.
* See the MissionStatement for author guidelines.
* See UserName for information about the usernames used.
* See the EmacsLogo for information about the logo this site is using.
* See [[CSS]] for some very simple themes to choose from.
* See EmacsWikiAppearance for how to create a user cascading style sheet if you don't like the defaults.

= Hosting =

AlexSchroeder is the administrator of this wiki. It is hosted by [http://thinkmo.de/ Thinkmo] in Germany. The first edit (see the first entry of the [Self:action=rc;all=1;from=1;showedit=1;rcidonly=SiteMap complete change log for SiteMap] was made in **2001-05-14**. The [http://web.archive.org/web/20010610005205/http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl Internet Archive Wayback Machine agrees] and has a snapshot for **2001-06-09**.

The Emacs Wiki is located at 
http://www.emacswiki.org/, or
http://purl.org/wiki/emacs/, or 
http://emacswiki.wikiwikiweb.de/, if
emacswiki.org is down.  This is a virtual hosting environment,
therefore you need to use HTTP/1.1 to access the site.

You can reach the provider at 
http://www.wikiwikiweb.de/ and
http://www.thinkmo.de/.  If you notice page corruption or other
problems, however, send mailto:alex@emacswiki.org or
mailto:alex@gnu.org.  The webmaster of emacswiki.org is also the
webmaster of all the other virtual hosts.

= Backups =

Help make distributed backups.
This will help us get the wiki back up and running if it goes down.
See WikiDownload for more.

= Money =

At the moment AlexSchroeder is paying for the server:
The people at thinkmo.de are asking for EUR 20 per month which basically
covers bandwidth.  This wiki and the blogs of my family
all run on the emacswiki.org domain and it's using about 10G per month.
I assume that most of the traffic is for the Emacs Wiki.  :)

There will not
be any ads on emacswiki.org; I hate them myself.  If you like the site
and want to contribute something, contribute either time or money:
Write content, fix typos, clean up pages by removing old discussions,
merging and splitting pages, and linking up and down the page
hierarchy.  If you do not have time, you can always donate money.
Show your support by saying on your homepage on this wiki how much you
donated to charity because of the Emacs Wiki.  That would be
awesome.

Anybody willing to share administrator duties on this wiki?
See EmacsWikiAdministrators.

= Wiki Engine =

This wiki runs Oddmuse; see the [http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?action=version version] page.

Using a wiki engine written in Lisp or Scheme would have been more in
the spirit of Emacs and XEmacs, but Perl is ubiquitous, and
Oddmuse is just one single Perl script, easy to install.

Please note bugs on the [[Problems]] page.
