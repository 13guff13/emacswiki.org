Sorry for the terrible markup -- I am unable to enter <br/>linebreaks

Apl comes under Debian under the Aplus packages.  These supposedly work 
under xemacs. 
== Apl under Xemacs ==
I could get it to work some 5 years ago. I could not recently. So...
Someone else can fill this :-)

I am going to stick to 
== Apl under Gnu Emacs ==
Cleaned up from

=== Assumptions ===
# You are running a recent gnuemacs under a recent debian.
In my case this is emacs 23 and 24 with debian unstable.
# You have the aplus-fsf packages installed. This is the list
aplus-fsf, xfonts-kapl and aplus-fsf-{doc,el,dev}
To test that aplus is running run a+ (not aplus) at a shell prompt
You should get a banner and a strange indent.
2 + 3 RET
should give you 5.  Char encoding issues will prevent much more here, so get out with a Ctrl-d
# You have Markus Triska's apl.el from http://stud4.tuwien.ac.at/~e0225855/unicapl/apl.el
Load it into emacs.
set-input-method to apl-ascii (in a fresh buffer if you like)
The left corner of the mode line should show 'apl' to indicate that emacs can deal with apl chars [toggle with C-\]
Typing {rho} {iota} {is} should give you rho iota and left arrow: (is ⍴ ⍳ ← )
=== Inferior Apl ===
# You should have inferior-apl.el  Lisp:inferior-apl.el.
Note: apl.el is needed for writing apl symbols but it has not interpreter functionality. inferior-apl.el has the interpreter functionality. It needs apl.el
# Set the load path (top of inferior-apl.el) to the path of apl.el
# Load inferior-apl.el (preferably into a fresh emacs)
# M-x run-apl
should start apl in an emacs buffer

Type A {is} 2 3 {rho} {iota} 6
The {is} {rho} and {iota} should immediately convert to ← ⍴ ⍳
Type A and a 2x3 matrix should be there

=== Apl Chars are where? ===
Look at the top of the apl.el file

Note the mappings are not one-one -- assignment can be written as any of {is} {gets} {<-}
