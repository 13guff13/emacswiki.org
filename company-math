You can use MELPA to install the default settings.

Three company backends, company-math-symbols-latex, company-math-symbols-unicode and company-latex-commands are proposed. 

The unicode backend lets you insert a unicode character by using the TeX backslashed syntax, for example \beta in order to display β.

By default, you will be allowed to insert unicode characters in normal text but not in a 'math' environment (for example inside two dollars '$ math italics $' in TeX or LaTeX, but also in other language like Org etc.). But it may not work and you could need a different setting.

For example, if you want to get unicode symbols instead of tex symbols in math environment ($β$ instead of $\beta$) and disallow the use of math unicode characters in normal text (β), you need to inverse the default setting.

== Inverting the default setting for package unicode-math ==
The package [[https://www.ctan.org/pkg/unicode-math|unicode-math]] can be used for XeTeX and LuaTeX tex engines, but you need to change the default setting of company-math.

At first, you need to know which font is used inside such a math environment: move your cursor to point (here under b in $\b$ ) and type 'C-u C-x ='. In addition to the position of your character, you will get information on the 'face' used in this math environment. For example, if you are using AUCTeX, you will probably get,
<pre>
...
  name: LATIN SMALL LETTER B
  general-category: Ll (Letter, Lowercase)
  decomposition: (98) ('b')

There are text properties here:
  face                 (font-latex-math-face font-latex-sedate-face)
  fontified            t
</pre>
The face font-latex-math-face is used by AUCTeX, otherwise tex-math is used. Once you know the face corresponding to your Emacs LaTeX mode, you can change the default setting of allow (company-math-allow-unicode-symbols-in-faces) from true to the corresponding face (or faces):
<pre>
(setq company-math-allow-unicode-symbols-in-faces (quote (tex-math font-latex-math-face))) ;
</pre>
If you kept the default setting of disallow unicode symbols to font-latex-math-face, by entering \b in math environment, only the ASCII representation \beta will be proposed instead of β, therefore you could change to nil
<pre>
(setq company-math-disallow-unicode-symbols-in-faces nil);
</pre>

Concerning what are called the latex symbols (ascii tex representations of TeX math symbols), you could change the default 'company-math-allow-latex-symbols-in-faces' which is set by default to (tex-math font-latex-math-face) to nil
<pre>
(setq company-math-allow-latex-symbols-in-faces nil);
</pre>

With these settings, you would be able to use the package 'unicode-math' in XeTeX, and get a smaller LaTeX source code for your maths!! Here is an example,
<pre>
\documentclass{article}
 \usepackage{fontspec}
 \usepackage{amsmath}
 \usepackage{unicode-math}
\begin{document}
 I can't enter unicode math character in text but in a math environment, just after the backslash and letter 'b' a menu will invite me to complete with M-u (M-n) or entering 'et' to beta and a RET will enter $β$.
\end{document}

If you are using AUCTeX you might need to use TeX-mode-hook

<pre>

(defun my-latex-mode-setup ()
  (setq-local company-backends
              (append '((company-math-symbols-latex company-math-symbols-unicode))
                      company-backends)))

(add-hook 'Tex-mode-hook 'my-latex-mode-setup)

</pre>
