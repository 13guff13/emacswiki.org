[[fr:SupprimerPage]]
Any page that is marked for deletion starts with a link to DeletedPage.
Pages cannot be deleted immediately, but all pages marked for deletion
will be permanently deleted after 21 days of inactivity.

In other words, every time somebody edits a page marked for deletion,
"the counter is reset".

Technically, this is implemented as a cron job that runs once every day
to do maintenance, including the deletion of pages that fit the description
given above.

Deleted pages are included in the RSS feed, since they are a significant change that needs to be reviewed.
