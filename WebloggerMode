WebloggerMode (<i>weblogger.el</i>) is an Emacs package that allows you to post to one of the following blog sites from emacs:

* Blogger
* Drupal
* LiveJournal
* MetaWeblog
* Moveable Type
* WordPress

This package is primarily written by MarkHershberger. It was developed from BloggerMode (blogger.el).

=Requirement=

WebloggerMode requires Lisp:xml-rpc.el .

=Download location=

The current version (1.43, last modified 9/13/09) is available at Lisp:weblogger.el.

The download area at http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/emacsweblogs is empty.

=Discussion=

(please improve this section)

After getting WebloggerMode, the user should either run

    M-x weblogger-setup-weblog RET

or define `weblogger-config-alist' manually to define the blogs (s)he wishes to post to.  


The biggest problem I had was when it asked me for the "Server Endpoint (URL)".  I'm using blogger.com, but I had no idea what to put here.  After a fair bit of hunting around, I found that this worked: "http://www2.blogger.com/api"

There is also another version available at http://jwickers.wordpress.com/2007/09/20/webloggerel-enhanced/ which includes patches and also:
* support categories (only for metaWebBlog)
* fix the date formating for Wordpress (and maybe others)

Please note that i only test it with the Wordpress used on my blog, but feedback is appreciated. 
There are also some oddities in regard of whether the post get published or not and sometimes may come back as Draft .. so i will  go on working on it when i have free time.

Here's a page which describes how to setup weblogger with Drupal:

===Does It Work?===

I spent about 2 hours in frustration trying to get  blogger.el  or weblogger.el to work.
For detail, see  http://xahlee.org/UnixResource_dir/writ/emacs_blogger_package_pain.html . In the end, i found http://code.google.com/p/e-blog/ that works fantastically. And if you want livejournal,http://code.google.com/p/ljupdate/ works wonders. â€” [[Xah Lee]]

Thanks Xah, we need to know what works and what does not.
I think this is one of the big problems with the elisp files out in the wild.

I've played around with this and find it to be functional for WordPress. Posts made are in raw HTML, allowing for links and &lt;!--more--&gt; parsing without a hitch during posting (but not during editing; see below). Categories (via "Keywords") also worked fairly well.

It's worth noting, however, that the full API isn't implemented (no comments), and there are still gremlins and undocumented dependencies in this package. For example, I use SSL encryption (via self-signed and/or CACert), which caused all sorts of annoying terminal beeps and Lisp errors during parsing. After a little experimentation and log reading, I discovered that only GnuTLS (gnutls-cli) was implemented functionally for my purposes, as an external dependency.

That said, I found this package to be quite functional after getting over those hurdles, posting to my blog nicely and cleanly in HTML. The gnus-style posting is much appreciated.

I also fixed up handling of &lt;!--more--&gt; tag functionality (in WordPress) and added the Keywords header to new entries by default. You can find my changes over at [[weblogger.el]]. Feel free to drop me a line on whether they work for you. :) -- [[Tom Robinson]]

Tom, et al, I'm using ;; Version: 1.4.1 ;; Last Modified: <2009-09-09 21:08:45 mah> of weblogger.el.  For the most part, it works great!  I have a Wordpress blog, hosted on Wordpress.com.  Posting entries went fine, but when it came to fetching, weblogger-fetch-entries returned "Invalid Header: `Newsgroup'" in the minibuffer, and did not fetch the post.  I commented out 		    
                    ;; (list "Newsgroup"
		    ;; 	  (concat (weblogger-weblog-name-from-id 
		    ;; 		   (weblogger-weblog-id))))

from (weblogger-entry-setup-headers) but do not have time right now to debug.  It did fix my problem, at least for now :)  Thanks! --ErikIverson

I tried to post a message, but I had HTML code in my text, and I received the error message "parse error. not well formed" when I tried to post. without the HTML code it worked fine. Switching to emacs 23.1 from 22 fixed it. --NicolauWerneck

I'm using version 1.4.3, with Emacs 23.1, Drupal 6.13 and Slackware 13.0. In spite of some odd behavior (e.g., can't get it to handle <title> tags automatically), it's a very useful addition to emacs. I had problems getting it to work initially but solved them by updating xml-rpc.el.

It's worth noting, as a usage quirk, that if you're revising an entry and do C-x C-s ("save") the entry revises, while if you do C-c C-c ("send") it will create a new entry. --JimKalb
