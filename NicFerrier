Iâ€™m [::nicferrier], a hacker trying to do interesting things. I use Emacs every day all the time. [[http://nic.ferrier.me.uk|Here's Nic's blog]].

I've used Emacs for about 20 years, every day, all the time for the last 15 years. I've done extensive Java, C, Python, ActionScript and Shell development inside Emacs, as well as a bunch of other languages. 

The last couple of years I've started to look at ELisp as a practical language (since it had closures basically) in which I might //one day// do all my work.

== About me ==

I work for [[http://thoughtworks.com|ThoughtWorks]] doing !DevOps stuff. 

I am trying to start [[http://teamchat.net|TeamChat.net]], a ChatOps company for teams built on Elnode, ShoesOff and other Emacs technology. 

I used to be the CTO at woome.com where we built video tools to help people get laid.

I maintain the [[http://marmalade-repo.org|marmalade Emacs package repo]] and am porting it to [[Elnode]].

I am the author and maintainer of [[Elnode]], the Emacs Async Webserver; more information about that in this page.

== Elnode: an asynchronous HTTP server for Emacs or node.js in EmacsLisp  == 
[[Elnode]] is an asynchronous TCP server handling HTTP.

Elnode is in the [http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/elnode marmalade repository]

As of now Elnode is functional. I am starting to write things with it:

* a pastebin style collabarative editor
* [[http://teamchat.net|TeamChat.net]] a ChatOps engine mashing up IRC, webapps and ChatBots.
* [[https://github.com/nicferrier/seville|the new version of Marmalade]] which would also be a reusable ELPA archive
* [[Elwiki]] an EmacsWiki engine

Other stuff I am considering:

* dynamic OrgAgenda export
* browser integration tools, for example an Emacs password store


== Creole ==

[[Creole]] is a Wiki markup language very like the one used here on [[Oddmuse|EmacsWiki]]. 

I develop and maintain the EmacsLisp version of a [[Creole]] [[http://github.com/nicferrier/elwikicreole|parser and HTML exporter]].

We are using [[Creole]] to develop [[Elwiki]], an EmacsWiki engine in EmacsLisp run with [[Elnode]].


== Useful links ==

[[CycleFontSizes|changing font size]] - the most useful thing is //C-0// to reset font size in a window.



== Email under Emacs ==

I've never liked gnus. But I do like Emacs as a mail platform so I've always maintained my own mail code.

Back in the last 90s I wrote an [[imapua|Emacs IMAP user agent based on the GNUs IMAP library]]. It worked ok but IMAP doesn't scale to big inboxes.

I've worked on a succession of different email clients since then, the current incarnation being [http://github.com/nferrier/emacs-maildir|Emacs Maildir]. It's fast, it's simple, it's easy.

== Emacs Daemon RC ==

Here's my daemon rc script:

{{{
#!/bin/bash

WHO=$(whoami)
[ "$WHO" != "nferrier" ] && exec su -c "$0 $*" - nferrier

EMACS=/home/nferrier/usr/emacs/bin/emacs

SERVERNAME=elnode
SOCKETPATH=/tmp/emacs$UID/$SERVERNAME

case $1 in

  start)
        ${EMACS}client -s $SOCKETPATH -e '(print (emacs-version))'
        if [ $? -ne 0 ] ; then $EMACS --daemon=$SERVERNAME ; fi
        ;;
 
  stop)
 	${EMACS}client -s $SOCKETPATH -e '(print (emacs-version))'
 	if [ $? -eq 0 ] ; then ${EMACS}client -s $SOCKETPATH -e '(kill-emacs)' *scratch* ; fi
 	;;
 
  status)
        if [ ! -S $SOCKETPATH ] ; then exit 1 ; fi
 	${EMACS}client -s $SOCKETPATH -e '(print (emacs-version))'
 	;;

esac

# End
}}}

[[https://gist.github.com/1966843|Here's the GIST of the same script]].
 
== Emacs in a screen terminal: colors ==

I do some remote pair programming inside screen. I would like to use emacs. Standard colors are too difficult for me to read (my eyes are going!).

vim has the very nice: 

{{{
set background=dark
}}}

which turns up the brightness on dark font faces. According to #emacs we have no equivalent.

So I wrote one:

{{{
(defvar dark-background nil)

(defun toggle-dark-background ()
  (interactive)
  (let ((difficult-colors
         '("red" "blue" "medium blue")))
    (mapc
     (lambda (face)
       (and (member (face-attribute face :foreground)  difficult-colors)
            (set-face-bold-p face (not dark-background))))
     (face-list)))
  (setq dark-background (not dark-background)))
}}}  

This toggles bold on the dark ones, which I think is all the vim thing is doing.

== Small Init Files ==

Another interest of mine is achieving portable Emacs config.  My plan is to achieve this through use of packages.

[[https://gist.github.com/3159186|This gist]] shows my self installing Emacs config except for the customizations.  The customizations are insecure because they contain passwords and such.  Solving portable customizations seems like a doable problem however.


== List of various other ELisp bits and pieces ==

I've done quite a few other packages for Emacs, most are on github but check these out:

* [[WikiDoc]] -- a program to make wiki documentation from Elisp functions, [[http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/wikidoc|marmalade repo here]], [[http://github.com/nicferrier/elwikidoc|github here]]
* fakir -- a library to make faking Emacs Lisp functions easier [[http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/fakir|marmalade repo here]], [[http://github.com/nicferrier/emacs-fakir|github here]]
 
And some other stuff I haven't packaged and probably never will:

* [[pastebin]] -- a simple interface to the [http://www.pastebin.com pastebin.com] webservice
* [[rcircPresence]] -- for syncing rcirc with some other presence thing (eg: skype)
* [[imapua]] -- a purely IMAP based email client for Emacs
* [[trac_editor]] -- a very simple interface to trac.py
* [[tzhelp]] -- a small set of tools for dealing with timezones

== Emacs under Mercurial ==

I used to maintain a mercurial copy of the emacs bzr repo at [https://bitbucket.org/nic/emacs bitbucket].

[https://bitbucket.org/nic/emacs-update/changeset/14a32e93c535 here is the update script I used].

I no longer maintain that, people weren't interested.
