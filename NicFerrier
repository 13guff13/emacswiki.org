Iâ€™m [::nicferrier], a hacker trying to do interesting things. I use Emacs every day all the time.

I am currently the CTO at [http://woome.com woome.com]

Anyone interested in hacking on woome.com can come talk to [mailto:nic@woome.com me]

I've done a few things with emacs which I'm trying to push into this wiki:

* [[pastebin]] - a simple interface to the [http://www.pastebin.com pastebin.com] webservice
* [[rcircPresence]] - for syncing rcirc with some other presence thing (eg: skype)
* [[imapua]] -- a purely IMAP based email client for Emacs
* [[trac_editor]] -- a very simple interface to trac.py

== Other interesting points ==

* I use [http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/ mercurial] to get emacs you can get it to by just using mercurial to clone [http://hg.intevation.org/emacs/ this]
* My emacs bits and pieces are in a mercurial repo [http://making.woome.com/repos/nics-emacs-bits/ here]

== Things I am interested in doing ==

* getting emacs to talk to dbus for things like IM alerts
** I use bitlbee/rcirc for all my im... but it's not good notification wise
* improving emacs as a mail client
* xml edting
* python editing
