Iâ€™m [::nicferrier], a hacker trying to do interesting things. I use Emacs every day all the time.

I am currently the CTO at [http://woome.com woome.com]

Anyone interested in hacking on woome.com can come talk to [mailto:nic@woome.com me]

I've done a few things with emacs which I'm trying to push into this wiki:

* [[pastebin]] -- a simple interface to the [http://www.pastebin.com pastebin.com] webservice
* [[rcircPresence]] -- for syncing rcirc with some other presence thing (eg: skype)
* [[imapua]] -- a purely IMAP based email client for Emacs
* [[trac_editor]] -- a very simple interface to trac.py
* [[WikiDoc]] -- a program to make wiki documentation from Elisp functions

== Emacs under Mercurial ==

* I host a mercurial copy of the emacs bzr repo at bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/nic/emacs
** and [https://bitbucket.org/nic/emacs-update/changeset/14a32e93c535 here is the update script I use]

== Things I am interested in doing ==

* getting the smallest most adaptable init file I can
* getting emacs to talk to dbus for things like IM alerts
** I use bitlbee/rcirc for all my im... but it's not good notification wise
* improving emacs as a mail client
* xml edting
* python editing
* exploting emacs async nature

== node js for emacs == 
[[Elnode]] is an asynchronous TCP server handling HTTP.

As of now elnode is just about functional. I am starting to write things with it including a port of my wiki based blog.

It's pretty good. I hope people pick it up because it's an interesting way to leverage Emacs.


== Emacs in a screen terminal: colors ==
I do some remote pair programming inside screen. I would like to use emacs. Standard colors are too difficult for me to read (my eyes are going!).

vim has the very nice: 

{{{
set background=dark
}}}

which turns up the brightness on dark font faces. According to #emacs we have no equivalent.

So I wrote one:

{{{
(defvar dark-background nil)

(defun toggle-dark-background ()
  (interactive)
  (let ((difficult-colors
         '("red" "blue" "medium blue")))
    (mapc
     (lambda (face)
       (and (member (face-attribute face :foreground)  difficult-colors)
            (set-face-bold-p face (not dark-background))))
     (face-list)))
  (setq dark-background (not dark-background)))
}}}  

This toggles bold on the dark ones, which I think is all the vim thing is doing.

== Small Init Files ==
For a long time I've used a complex init file with loads of stuff in it. This is great, it means emacs starts up with all my goodies. But it also means when I go to another emacs I'm lost. It's also non-trivial to move my stuff to another emacs.

I am trying to pair down my emacs use to the standard dist delivered behaviour and then add obvious extras on top. This is a process I started long ago but is still underway.

I am about to get rid of this keybinding from my personal emacs:

{{{
(global-set-key "\C-xh" 'toggle-truncate-lines)
}}}

That's been something I've used quite a bit over the years... but it turns out it was just one of those things I adopted because I didn't understand emacs correctly. It should be a customized setting, occasionaly switching it to untruncated by using the toggle.

Once I have a minimally changed emacs I can start looking to distribute extensions in a more sensible manner.
