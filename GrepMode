This page is about the Emacs `grep' command. '''See Also:''' OccurMode

== lgrep and rgrep ==

With Emacs 22 and later comes the very easy to use yet powerful commands lgrep and rgrep. They both prompt the user for what to search for in a convenient manner. You do not have to know the unix grep command (but if you know it you can use that knowledge too). *lgrep* searches in the current directory and *rgrep* searches the current directory tree. rgrep knows about version control systems so it can avoid searching its control directories.

One very conventient thing is that lgrep and rgrep shares command argument history with grep. This mean that you after using them can use the grep command to for example filter the output results, perhaps like this:

    grep -i -nH -e "eshell/" *.el | grep -v defun


== Emacs Grep ==

The Emacs `grep' command lets you run the Unix or GNU/Linux `grep' program, which searches files for lines that match a regular expression (regexp). The Emacs command colors the output and makes found lines clickable: When you click a search hit, Emacs visits the target file at the occurrence.

For example, use `M-x grep' with the following input -- in this case, the regexp is a string literal, `setq', and there is only one file to search, ##~/.emacs##.

  M-x grep -n -e setq ~/.emacs

This lists all lines matching `setq' in your Emacs InitFile, ##~/.emacs##, showing the filename and the line numbers. When you hit `RET' or click `mouse-2' on one of the lines, the file is opened at the matching line.

The ##-n##, which makes `grep' add line numbers to the output, is necessary to make the search results active, so that you can navigate to them in the ways mentioned above. Since it's necessary, Emacs automatically includes ##-n## -- you need not type it.

Hits from `##M-x grep##' can be iterated through using `##C-x `##'. This runs Emacs command `next-error'.


== Using grep and find on Windows ==

The [[EmacsW32]] distribution comes with ##grep## and ##find## included.

Alternatively, if you are using the standard Emacs distribution, you can obtain them from the [http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/ GnuWin32] project:

* [http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/grep.htm Grep for Windows]
* [http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/findutils.htm FindUtils for Windows]

They are installed in ##C:\Program Files\GnuWin32\bin## by default. Copy ##grep.exe## and ##find.exe## to Emacs' own ##bin## directory. Emacs will then use these files over any other executables with the same name, including Windows' own ##find## utility.

For some additional tweaking, do

    (eval-after-load 'grep
      '(progn
         (grep-apply-setting
          'grep-template
          "grep <C> -d skip -nH -e <R> <F>")
         (add-to-list 'grep-files-history "*")))

This makes `M-x lgrep' skip directories without warnings. Also, the default is to search ''all'' files, that is, "##*##".


== Grep+: Enhancements to Emacs grep ==

DrewAdams has written some libraries that provide enhancements to the standard Emacs <code>grep</code> command. See GrepPlus.


[:GrepOnlyMarkedFiles]
== Grep Only Marked Files in Dired ==

DiredPlus binds '''`M-g'''' in DiredMode to `diredp-do-grep', which lets you `grep' only the marked files in a Dired buffer -- or the next ''N'' files if you use a prefix arg. This applies even if the buffer contains inserted subdirectories: all marked files are grepped. Or right-click (`mouse-3') and choose '''Grep''' from the menu to grep just the file you clicked.

You can also use `M-g' to `grep' marked files in a Dired buffer that has an explicit list of files from different directories, such as all files in a project. See, for example, [[Icicles - Dired Enhancements#MarkedFilesAsProject|Marked Files as a Project]]


== Grep All Files in a File Set ==

With [[Icicles]], you can save sets of file-name completion candidates, either persistently as a project or ephemerally as a variable value. You can then `grep' all of the file in such a saved set using command `icicle-grep-saved-file-candidates'. See [[Icicles - Support for Projects#icicle-grep-saved-file-candidates|icicle-grep-saved-file-candidates]].


== Icicles Search for `grep' or `compile' Results ==

With [[Icicles]], in a compilation-results buffer such as `*Compilation*' or `*grep*', you can use command `icicle-compilation-search' (`##C-`##') to search among the result set (search hits). This is similar to `icicle-search', but when you use `C-RET', `C-mouse-2', `C-prior', `C-next', `C-up', or `C-down', it visits the source code that corresponds to the current line in the compilation buffer.

Using `icicle-compilation-search' with `grep' output gives you multiple levels of regexp searching. In Emacs 22 and later, you can also replace `grep' search-hit text.


== igrep for recursive grepping ==

You might prefer ##igrep.el##, by Kevin Rogers, to standard Emacs `grep', because of its transparent interface. It uses the Unix or GNU/Linux command `##find |xargs grep##', and puts the results, including the matched lines, in buffer ##igrep##. The keys bound to `next-error' and `prev-error' work on that buffer and open the corresponding files. No replace capability, though.

Here is the igrep page on the wiki:

* Lisp:igrep.el

##igrep-next-error.el## (1.2) is an add-on to ##igrep.el##, which highlights the matched text in the source file buffer (see also http://cedet.sourceforge.net/highlightcompile.shtml for this feature)

* http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/gnu-emacs-sources/2004-05/msg00070.html

== `mgrep' and `color-grep' ==

`mgrep' and `color-grep' are by [[Matsushita]].

== TraverseDirectory ==

Lisp:traverselisp.el

Do basically the same as `rgrep', but don't use external programs, only Lisp. Traverselisp have also replacing capabilities: when the regexp is found in all the files of all subdirectories, you can replace this regexp interactively or not, skip a line, or stop. Traverselisp can be launched from dired directly.

You can also get it here with Mercurial:

    hg clone http://freehg.org/u/thiedlecques/traverselisp/

== Use with Anything ==
'''[[Anything]]''' is a candidate selection framework.
Install Lisp:anything-grep.el after installing Anything.
Start with `M-x anything-grep', narrow matched lines by typing some patterns(multiple patterns are space-delimited string),
select with up/down/pgup/pgdown/C-p/C-n/C-v/M-v, choose with enter,

With C-z the selected line is displayed without quitting anything session.

`M-x anything-grep-by-name' greps from predefined location.

== Grep-A-Lot ==

Lisp:grep-a-lot.el

Manage multiple grep results buffers: search results go into a newly created buffer instead of clobbering the contents of the last search results buffer.

Buffers are assigned successive id numbers: ##*grep*<N>##, and you can switch between the buffers either as a ring (next/previous buffer) or as a stack (thus providing a recursive search facility, similar to recursive tags navigation).

You can also get Grep-A-Lot with git:

    git clone git://github.com/ZungBang/emacs-grep-a-lot.git

Hi, I do not think defining global keymap on the top level of elisp is good idea. You should define a function to define keymap like `find-function-setup-keys'. -- [[rubikitch]]

Fixed. Thanks for the tip. -- AviRozen

== Grep-O-Matic ==

Lisp:grep-o-matic.el

An extension that automates searching for the word at point in the current repository (requires Lisp:repository-root.el), current directory or the set of currently open files.

You can also get Grep-O-Matic with git:

    git clone git://github.com/ZungBang/emacs-grep-o-matic.git

== Find/Grep from shell-mode ==

While not explicitly about emacs grep, I use the following recipe to intelligently pattern search a really large source tree like Chromium or the Linux kernel.  The three steps:

1) build a persistent subset of target files to search, the ##filelist##,
2) interactively use grep to reduce the ##filelist## to a ##targetlist##,
3) search the ##targetlist## for patterns.

Step #1, use ##find## to build the ##filelist## and save in a local temp file.  For example, to build a list of files from the Chromium source:

  find /opt/chromium/src -wholename '*/.svn' -prune -o -type f -regex ".*\.\(c\|cc\|h\|js\)" -print > CSRC.LST

Then I hand-edit the ##filelist## to remove files in which I am not interested (or redundant in the case of the Linux kernel source tree.)  This saves *A LOT* of time a large trees.

Step #2 and #3 are a pipe of 
Then I create a temp file to execute a lisp eval on a shell-command and capture output for Steps #2 and #3. The shell-command invokes a pipe of `grep' calls to filter down to the ##targetlist## and then one final call to search the ##targetlist## for matching patterns.

Example elisp calls:

  (shell-command "grep '\\.cc' CSRC.LST | xargs grep -n CONTEXT_VALID_ESI" 1)
  (shell-command "grep '.' CSRC.LST | xargs grep -n CHROMIUM" 1)
  (shell-command "grep '.' CSRC.LST | xargs grep -l NACL_OSX | xargs grep -n NACL_LINUX" 1)

Put the cursor at the end of the expression and run `eval-last-sexp' and the `grep -n' output will appear after the shell-command expression.

A simple macro can be triggered on a match line to load the file/lineno into another window or frame depending on your desires.

I have found this to be far easier and quicker than etags or source browsing tools to inspect code.  It also uses standard tools with a large number of recipes to follow.  I extensively use registers and bookmarks for later referral.
