JoeBloggs, why don't you put this on github.  This way you get issue tracking, git repo, etc all for free. -- LeWang

==What is OneKey ?==
OneKey is a popup help window which appears when you type a *Top Key*.
It shows *Keystrokes* and *Commands* in a help window.

==Why I needed OneKey ?==
* *I am new to emacs and want to learn the common keybindings*
:: By default OneKey comes with a *top-level* menu containing submenus for all the common prefix keys and commands.
:: The emacs keybindings are displayed next to the commands to help you learn them. More frequently accessed items
:: are highlighted to help you quickly pick them out.
* *I have too many commands I need to remember*:
:: When I install lots of useful extension in Emacs, I always forget the bindings for their commands, because there are so many to remember.
:: OneKey contains a *major-mode* menu which contains the keybindings and menu items for the current major-mode, and it
:: also allows you to quickly find a command by filtering by regular expressions.
:: You can also easily create your own menus.
* *I don't have a spare, easy keystroke free to bind to a command.*:
:: Emacs has so many handy commands, but I don't have any keystrokes free to bind new commands to.

: OneKey provides a single top-level keystroke, which gives you access to kestroke menus in a pop-up window. 
: You simply type the keystroke shown in the window, which executes the corresponding command, or press the left/right
: arrow key to change to a different menu. You can also easily create your own menus.
: So you just need remember the Top keystroke with the group command, and the other keystrokes will be displayed in a pop-up window.

==To Install==
: Add Lisp:one-key.el in your load-path, then add 
{{{
        (require 'one-key)
        (global-set-key (kbd "<menu>") 'one-key-open-default-menu-set)
}}}
: in ~/.emacs (replace "<menu>" with whatever key you want to use).

==Usage==


==Customize==
All the options below can be customized by M-x customize-group RET one-key RET

* Don't popup help window automatically:

: You can setup option `one-key-popup-window' with 'nil' if you don't like help window popup automatically the fist time call it.

* Number of items per line.

: You can setup option `one-key-items-per-line' to customize the number of items per line.
: If the value of this option is `nil', the number will be calculated by `window-width'.

* Maximum height of help window:

: Option `one-key-help-window-max-height' is the maximum height of the help window. 

* Name of help window.

: You can customize `one-key-buffer-name' to change the name of the help buffer.

* Buffer name for generate template code.

: You can customize `one-key-template-buffer-name' to change the buffer name that contain template code.

* Auto-load one-key menus

: If you have a lot of one-key menus you may want to keep them in seperate files instead of cluttering your .emacs file.
: You can define a directory in which to keep your one-key menus as seperate .el files, and have them automatically
: loaded at startup.

* Major mode associations

: You can associate a different one-key menu with each major mode which is opened by default for that mode.

==Tips==

: Type "?" to toggle help window display.
: Type "C-?" followed by one of the keys in the menu to show a description of the associated command.
: Type "q" to quit OneKey and hide help window.
: Type "C-b" to go back to the previous or toplevel menu

:: NOTE: The keystrokes above are built-ins for controlling the help window.  Of course if you bind them to another command, OneKey will instead execute that. 

:: And whatever your binding, you can use the keystroke "C-g" to abort OneKey. 

==Description==
The core function is `one-key-menu'.  Here is some more detail about its arguments.

* title:

: The title information shown in echo-area or help window for identified.

* info-alist:

: The alist contains help information, with the format (("KEY" . "HELP") . COMMAND)

* miss-match-exit-p

: Whether to hide the help window when you type a *mismatched* keystroke.

* recursion-p

: Whether recursion execute self until you type "q".

* protect-function

: The protect function to make OneKey execute it when exception abort OneKey.

* alternate-function

: The last function call after OneKey command execute.

* execute-last-command-when-miss-match

: Whether to execute last input command when miss matched keystroke alist.

:: You can find it at Lisp:lazy-search.el .
:: And have some enhanced functions for LazySearch, at Lisp:lazy-search-extension.el .

==Dialog==
: Do you know OneTwoThreeMenu? -- [[rubikitch]]
:: Wow, i have never heard it, and looks have same design purpose for remember keystroke.
:: At the beginning, i just want write a mode to help me remember keystroke and *free* my handy keystrokes for other extensions.
:: So i write OneKey, just for lazy.  -- AndyStewart

 I have a problem when assigning, for example, `mark-paragraph' function to a key, the paragraph is not marked. While using `M-x mark-paragraph' works! Any idea what is wrong?

I found Lisp:one-key-default.el a bit annoying: after loading it, I can't bind key to `C-x j',`C-x p' etc any longer (as `C-x' is no longer a prefix key), and I can't use `C-x C-h' to query the keybindings list either. Thus it is only useful for learning Emacs default keys. 

I wrote a new routine to bind e.g. `ESC C-x' to the one-key-menu. `C-x' is still a prefix key. You can add keybindings to `C-x j', you can use `C-x C-h' to query keybindings list and you can use `one-key-refresh-menu' to refresh the menu (after adding `C-x j', `C-x p' etc).
{{{
    (defun one-key-bind-keymap (key keymap-prefix)
      "Generate an one-key menu for keys starting with `keymap-prefix', and bind it to `key'.

    It also bind `keymap-prefix'-? to the same one-key menu, if not in use.

    For example, when called with ('ESC <f1>', '<f1>'), it would
    generate one-key menu 'one-key-menu-<f1>', and bind 'ESC <f1>'
    and '<f1> ?' to one-key-menu-<f1>.
    "
      (if (keymapp (key-binding (read-kbd-macro keymap-prefix)))
          (let ( (one-key-menu-sym (intern (format "one-key-menu-%s"
                               (replace-regexp-in-string " " "-" keymap-prefix)))) )
        (let ( (prefixed-?-key (read-kbd-macro (concat keymap-prefix " ?"))) )
          (unless (key-binding prefixed-?-key)
            (global-set-key prefixed-?-key one-key-menu-sym)))
        (with-temp-buffer
          (one-key-insert-template keymap-prefix keymap-prefix)
          (eval-buffer))
        (global-set-key (read-kbd-macro key) one-key-menu-sym))
        (message "'%s' is not a keymap-prefix" keymap-prefix)))

    ;; use it this way in your ~/.emacs
    (one-key-bind-keymap "ESC C-x" "C-x")


    (defun one-key-refresh-menu (fkey)
      (interactive "sfkey: ")
      (one-key-bind-keymap (concat "ESC " fkey) fkey))

    ;;use `M-x one-key-refresh-menu' at anytime to refresh the menu
    
}}}

I found that when I have (one-key-default-setup-keys) in my .emacs, I do not get the eshell prompt.

That is strange, it works fine for me [[JoeBloggs]]
