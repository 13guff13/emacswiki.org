YARI (Yet Another Ri Interface) provides an Emacs frontend to Ruby's `ri' documentation tool. It offers lookup and completion.

This packages is completely replacement for RiEmacs and RiEl. I have tried to test this extension against every RDoc version. Please, report any problems to [::hron].

Interesting! I am a Rubyist. Why do you develop this? I want to know differences with RiEmacs and RiEl. -- [[rubikitch]]
