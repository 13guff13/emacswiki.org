GNU *Zile* ("Zile Is Lossy Emacs") is a lightweight ErsatzEmacs from the Free Software Foundation. It attempts to emulate the behavior of its "big brother" in a small package, so that Emacs users can feel at home in limited environments.

For customization, Zile uses its own limited configuration language known as *Zile Lisp*.
Zile Lisp is a tiny subset of Emacs Lisp that consists of the Zile commands plus `setq'.
