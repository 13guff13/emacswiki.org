I'm Tim Chambers 1E4AF729D5CEFFD0. I love GnuEmacs. My initials are tbc. I'm an alum of MIT.

If you're the first one to guess my email and write to me, I'll buy you a beverage of your choice next time we meet face to face [1]. This is sort of a hobby of mine. I have open beverage debts going back to March, 2010. Really. Iâ€™d like to buy you a beverage.

[1] Within reason. No premium aged scotch, no champagne from Champagne, no Belgian Chimay beer, no Kopi Luwak. I trust you get the idea.
