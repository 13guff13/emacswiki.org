Use `M-x find-grep-dired' interactively to search and replace a regex across all files in a specified directory and subdirectories which match a pattern.

As described in [http://atomized.org/2009/05/emacs-nerdery-search-replace-across-files/ this blog post], basic usage is:

    M-x find-grep-dired RET catch (FooException RET
    % m .php$ RET
    Q catch (FooException RET catch (BarException RET

At this point, Emacs will cycle through every match in every file and ask you to confirm the replacement. If you press ##!##, it will replace the rest of the matches in the current file, and start prompting you for the next; ##Y## will replace every match in every file with no further prompting. `M-,' restarts the interactive prompting if you break out of it.

See DiredSearchAndReplace for more information.
