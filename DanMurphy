Daniel L. Murphy invented '''TECO''', Emacs's mother.

TECO introduced the spirit and approach behind Emacs. Emacs was not simply "''implemented'' in TECO", as you sometimes hear.

What did ''Emacs'' add then?

* The idea that ''everything'' is a [[command]], including self-inserting characters. That is, every [[key]] is bound to an "editor macro".
* And (later) Lisp.
