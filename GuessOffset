`guess-offset.el' provides a hook for c-mode and related modes. It tries
to detect the `c-basic-offset' used for a visited C source file,
transparently adapting to different code layouts.

More information in the source commentary. 

* Lisp:guess-offset.el

This is the first release of guess-offset and should be considered beta 
software. If it happens to guess wrong, you may have to tweak the parameters 
a little, they are documented. Please share your wisdom in this case.

Comments and suggestions are welcome.

Turning on indent-tab-mode for buffers which use tabs for indentation would be very useful.

Using SmartTabs, there's no offset to guess. :)

I am working on a successor to `guess-offset.el' which - among other improvements - is now a minor mode, supports additional languages, provides detection of `indent-tab-mode', and has better heuristics. The working title is `dtrt-indent.el'. More information can be found in the commentary.

Visit the [https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/dtrt-indent/ project page] or follow this [http://git.savannah.nongnu.org/gitweb/?p=dtrt-indent.git;a=blob_plain;f=dtrt-indent.el;hb=HEAD direct link to HEAD].

Again, suggestions are welcome. Please use Savannah's bug tracker as I won't drop by this page very often.   --JulianScheid

I've also written a package for this:  [[GuessStyle]] --[[nschum]]
