If you often edit source code residing in subdirectories relative to your Makefile, you can use this to directly (re)build:

<pre>
(defun get-above-makefile () (expand-file-name
	   "Makefile" (loop as d = default-directory then (expand-file-name
	   ".." d) if (file-exists-p (expand-file-name "Makefile" d)) return
	   (shell-quote-argument d))))

;; bind compiling with get-above-makefile to f5
(global-set-key [f5] (lambda () (interactive) (compile (format
	   "make -f %s" (get-above-makefile)))))
</pre>
