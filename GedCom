GEDCOM was developed by the Family History Department of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) to provide a flexible, uniform format for exchanging computerized genealogical data. GEDCOM is an acronym for   GE nealogical   D ata   Com munication. Its purpose is to foster the sharing of genealogical information and the development of a wide range of inter-operable software products to assist genealogists, historians, and other researchers.

This can be used together with Lifelines [http://www.algonet.se/~arvid/jens/gen/ll/lifelines.en.html].
Lifelines is a genealogical database and report generator which uses GEDCOM records as its input.
