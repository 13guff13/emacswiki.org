'''Category Programming''' is about using Emacs in programming other languages than EmacsLisp. Click the heading to find pages that link to this page.  

Language-specific:

* AssemblyProgramming -- Programming with the assembler.
* CProgrammingLanguage -- C specific programming.
* CPlusPlus -- C++ specific programming.
* DProgrammingLanguage -- D specific programming.
* EcmaScript -- Programming in Javascript, Jscript, and !ActionScript.
* JavaDevelopmentEnvironment -- a great set of tools for Java programmers.
* MozillaDevelopmentEnvironmentforEmacs -- support for Mozilla technologies in Emacs.
* PerlLanguage -- Perl specific programming.
* RubyLanguage -- Ruby specific programming.

Coding style:

* CategoryIndentation
* CommentingCode
* DeletingTypedefs -- adapt your coding style and convert typedefs to plain structs
* AutomaticFileHeaders -- automatic insertion and update of file headers for different types of file (C, shell, EmacsLisp, and so on). 

Code navigation and information:

* ElDoc -- echos the argument list of functions in the echo area
* [[ESense]] - ESense - Erlang "IntelliSense" for Emacs
* [[EAssist]] - Offers rapid method/function navigation for C++, C, Java, Lisp...
* Lisp:tooltip-help.el --- show help as tooltip

Development environments:

* ProjectBufferMode -- generic mode to handle projects
* CollectionOfEmacsDevelopmentEnvironmentTools -- complete development environment
* ObjectOrientedBrowser -- supports C++, Java, Python, and a few other languages
* EmacsBrowse -- simpler than ObjectOrientedBrowser, but comes with Emacs
* EmacsForDevStudioUsers-- will make your MSVC-using friend envious of your comfortable development environment
* IdeSkel -- simple environment for svn/cvs projects, with embedded "speedbars"
* MultiTerm -- Use multiple terminals in Emacs, support dedicated window for debug program.
* [[eproject]] - project workspaces for emacs

File management:

* ChangeLog -- Log the changes to your source files.
* ProjectSettings -- Configuration settings for an entire project (directory).
* ProjectWizard -- simple, customizable project wizard
* SimpleProjectManagment -- A simple project managment
* ProjmanMode -- move between different projects (directories) maintaining options and open buffers for each
* [http://www.littleredbat.net/mk/code/mk-project.html mk-project] -- Quickly switch between projects and perform operations on a per-project basis
* SpeedBar -- provides alternate views into individual source files
* SrSpeedbar -- Display speedbar in same frame, very handy!
* EmacsCodeBrowser -- provides views of directories and files that go one step beyond what SpeedBar does
* AutomaticFileHeaders -- automatic insertion and update of file headers for different types of file (C, shell, EmacsLisp, and so on). 
* VersionControl -- Manage revisions to your source files.
