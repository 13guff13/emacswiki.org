I have been using Emacs since 1994 and use it on Mac OS X, Linux,
Solaris, and sometimes on Windows. It has not been the smoothest ride,
I have tried to exchange Emacs for other tools like Eclipse,
!NetBeans, Thunderbird, Mail.app etc, but I have given up. Emacs is for
me.

== Emacs Daily Usage ==

I use Emacs daily for
* [CategoryViewMail reading/writing my Email],
* [OrgMode organising] my life,
* [AUCTeX writing papers], and of course for
* programming.

== Init Files ==

* RobertAnderssonConfig -- the Mac Mini @ work running Mac OS 10.5; and
the !ThinkPad @ work running Mandriva 2010 and Windows 7
