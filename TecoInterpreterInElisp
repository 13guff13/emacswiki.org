Dale Worley has written a TECO interpreter in elisp.  You can find the
latest version, v7, here: Lisp:teco.el.  Note that there is a bug when
it is used with Emacs v22.  Since the prompt string in a minibuffer is
now returned as a form field, using a non-null 'teco:prompt' value
causes 'teco:command' to fail to read your command string properly.
Setting 'teco:prompt' to "" works around it.
