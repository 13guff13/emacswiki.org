Doesn't work on buffers like *scratch*, i.e., with `emacs-lisp-mode', because its `fill-paragraph-function', `lisp-fill-paragraph', ignores `fill-column' if `emacs-lisp-docstring-fill-column' is an integer.  Setting it locally to t solves the issue.

    ;;; A unfill-paragraph that works even in emacs-lisp-mode
    (defun unfill-paragraph (&optional region)
      "Takes a multi-line paragraph and makes it into a single line of text."
      (interactive (progn (barf-if-buffer-read-only) '(t)))
      (let ((fill-column (point-max))
            (emacs-lisp-docstring-fill-column t))
        (fill-paragraph nil region)))
