elnode is an asynchronous HTTP server framework. You can use it to write HTTP services in ELisp.

[http://github.com/nicferrier/elnode Download elnode from github]

elnode is basically an ELisp version of [http://nodejs.org/ node.js], the asynchronous HTTP framework for Google's Javascript engine.

Potentially, elnode could be more useful than node.js because elnode has the Emacs editing and debugging framework around it. It is extremely easy to debug elnode handler code because of Emacs.

elnode's performance is better than I expected, although we haven't done a formal test.

If you're interested in helping it's best to contact NicFerrier or leave a note on this page.
