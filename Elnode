Elnode is an asynchronous HttpServer framework. You can use it to write HTTP services in EmacsLisp.

Hacking HTTP servers with Elnode is quite easy because of the Emacs editing and debugging framework around it. 

Elnode's performance is better than I expected, although we haven't done a formal test.
