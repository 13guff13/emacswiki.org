Elnode is an asynchronous HttpServer framework. You can use it to write HTTP services in EmacsLisp.

== What Elnode is ==

Elnode is basically an ELisp version of [http://nodejs.org/ node.js],
the asynchronous HTTP framework for Google's Javascript engine.

Hacking HTTP servers with Elnode is quite easy because of the Emacs editing and debugging framework around it. 

Elnode's performance is better than I expected, we can get about 5000 request per second out of it.  The limitating factor is likely Emacs async IO which uses //select//.  Replacing that with //epoll// or some other fast equivalent would likely give us node.js like performance. 


== What is node.js? ==

node.js is an evented IO server framework in Javascript. node.js is
not a browser thing. It is a server side thing. You write event driven
servers in it. That means you write all your code in a single process
and rely on the natural blocking of clients to give you
concurrency. Of course, a standard technique is to to spawn processes
to handle work - again, communicating asynchronously.


== What is Elnode? ==

Emacs includes a low level event IO framework: processes, filters and
sentinels. Elnode builds mechanisms for making HTTP servers on top of
these in similar ways to node.js.

Elnode should be used for making small, personal web services or for developing a first draft of a web service you may later do in Clojure or Node.js or some other web framework.

Emacs is a very good Lisp programming environment as well as a great editor. Now that Emacs 24 has lexical scope EmacsLisp is a very powerful language. A webserver framework inside such a powerful Lisp environment therefore makes sense.


== Getting Elnode ==

* marmalade - M-x install-package [ENTER] elnode
* [http://github.com/nicferrier/elnode Download elnode from github]
** if you do this you should build and install the package, see the [[https://github.com/nicferrier/elnode/blob/master/Makefile#L30|Makefile]]


== Talking about Elnode ==

We talk about Elnode on #emacs, I am often there so just shout me.  Other people on #emacs know quite a lot about Elnode too.

We don't have a mailing list yet.  If you would like to provide one (ad free please) then please get in touch.

== A tutorial for Elnode ==

People asked for a tutorial, so NicFerrier has started to make one. Progress is [[https://github.com/nicferrier/elnode/blob/master/elnode_tutorial.creole|here]].

You need the latest version of Elnode (0.8) to make this tutorial work.
