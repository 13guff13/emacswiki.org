ELIM is an elisp instant messenger daemon (using libpurple), with a sexp based control protocol. Developed by fledermaus.

== Obtaining ELIM ==

* The [https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/elim savannah page]
* [https://savannah.nongnu.org/files/?group=elim tarballs] (the most recent one is usually what you should get).
* [http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/elim.git git repo browser]

The README included should tell you everything you need to know to get started with basic IM functionality.

The reference IM client implemented on top of ELIM is Garak, it is included with in the ELIM tarball.

== Wish list ==

* Replace libpurple with telepathy (pretty please?). ;)
** There is an ongoing effort to add telepathy as a backend for libpurple, so this would be wasted effort.
* Make an ELPA package for it. (An ELPA package doesn't really make sense since ELIM is a C program. Distributing the elisp portion by itself is not that helpful. --technomancy)
* **[DONE]** //Add a screenshot of it to this wiki entry, tasteful eye candy is a good thing.//
* Notify the user when a new message is received.
