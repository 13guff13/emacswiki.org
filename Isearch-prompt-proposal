This proposal starts by just adding a help reminder at the right-edge of the echo area. 

* The reminder is: ##[F1 m] Help##. 
* It is only added if there's plenty of space (enough so that there's a lot of empty space after the “Isearch:” prompt for the user to type).

----------

The next part of the proposal is to change the reminder to just ##[F1] Help##, and thus rebind ##F1## to the isearch help (users can still access the usual help keymap with ##C-h##).

----------

The final part (which is unlikely to be done before the 25.1 feature freeze) is to implement an “Isearch Options Buffer”, and to display that instead of the isearch help.
This buffer would be more concise than the isearch-mode Help, and would offer checkboxes the user can click to change search options.
