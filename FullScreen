== Emacs Frame Properties ==

    (defun fullscreen (&optional f)
      (interactive)
      (set-frame-parameter f 'fullscreen
                           (if (frame-parameter f 'fullscreen) nil 'fullboth)))

    (global-set-key [f11] 'fullscreen)

    (add-hook 'after-make-frame-functions 'fullscreen)


== Send X Messages to the Window Manager ==

     (defun fullscreen ()
       (interactive)
       (x-send-client-message nil 0 nil "_NET_WM_STATE" 32
	    		 '(2 "_NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN" 0)))

== External program: wmctrl == 

If you want to bind F11 to toggle full-screen, here is what you need:

* install wmctrl (sudo apt-get install wmctrl)

* edit your .emacs and add:

    (defun switch-full-screen ()
      (interactive)
      (shell-command "wmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -btoggle,fullscreen"))

    (global-set-key [f11] 'switch-full-screen)

That does the trick, 
and now you are GNOME HIG compliant :)

== External program: devilspie ===

http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/linux/full-screen-emacs.xml

    ;;
    ;; ~/.devilspie/emacs.ds
    ;;
    (if (or (contains (window_class) "emacs") (contains (window_class) "Emacs"))
        (undecorate fullscreen))

== Gnome Keyboard Shortcuts==

If you use GNOME you can assign a Keyboard Shortcut to toggle Full Screen or not. Just go to 

System => Preferences => Keyboard Shortcuts

And bind the option "Toggle fullscreen mode" to a key which can be used when using Emacs to toggle full screen or not.

The disadvantage of this is that if you bind F11 so that emacs matches other programs, then the window manager handles the resize/de-chroming and the application does not get a chance to modify it's appearance. For example, many applications remove their menu and button bars when in fullscreen mode.

== Fullscreen on MS Windows ==

If you're using MS Windows, and want to use "real fullscreen", i.e, getting rid of the top titlebar and all, see
w32-fullscreen at the site for [http://www.martyn.se/code/emacs/darkroom-mode/ darkroom-mode]

== Fullscreen on OS X ==

The function at the top of the page should work with CarbonEmacs and Aquamacs but fullscreen functionality has not made it into Emacs-23 as of early 2009.

The following line can be added to your .emacs
{{{
(set-frame-parameter nil 'fullscreen 'fullboth)
}}}

The current CVS version of Emacs-23 does not support the above technique.
Use [http://github.com/jmjeong/my-dot-emacs/blob/master/maxframe.el patched maxframe.el]. You can see the original version from [http://files.emacsblog.org/ryan/elisp/maxframe.el maxframe.el].

	  (restore-frame)

== Toggle fullscreen - linux and windows ==

== Q&A ==

** Under Fvwm 2.5.23 I get a little band of background at the bottom
   of the screen --- any solution for that?  I have yet to try it with
   another WM.

** The solution is to add Style "*" <nowiki>ResizeHintOverride</nowiki> to your config
** This also occurs under Fluxbox 1.0; the current git repository
fixes this problem
** Not a problem under KDE 3.5.7
** Echo area cannot be displayed after fullscreen call,for windows, maybe ”(w32-send-sys-command 61488)“ should be used to maximize emacs window
