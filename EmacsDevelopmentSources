[[zh:Emacs开发版源码]]
The Emacs development sources are kept in a CVS repository at http://savannah.gnu.org/. 

Some people would like to use the new features available in the next release.  Others want to help contribute to Emacs by testing the development sources and maybe even report EmacsBugs.  Others are just interested in following Emacs's development.  Some other just like "living on the edge".

For information on how to get them directly, see:

* EmacsFromCVS -- how to get the development sources from CVS
* EmacsFromArch -- how to get the current development sources using the arch (aka tla) revision control system
* EmacsFromBazaar -- get emacs with bzr
* EmacsFromGit -- how to get emacs from the semi-official git mirror

See BuildingEmacs for how to build Emacs from the source package.

See EmacsPretest for information about getting sources snapshots made by the Emacs maintainers before a release.

See the EmacsCVSFeatures for how to find out about new features.

Binary packages built from CVS snapshots are available for various systems:

* EmacsCvsAndDebian
* EmacsApp
* CategoryWThirtyTwo has a list of unofficial CVS Emacs binaries.
