[[zh:Emacs开发版源码]]
The Emacs development sources are kept in a [[Bazaar]] repository. [ConcurrentVersionsSystem CVS] is not used anymore.

Some people would like to use the new features available in the next release.  Others want to help contribute to Emacs by testing the development sources and maybe even report EmacsBugs.  Others are just interested in following Emacs's development.  Some other just like "living on the edge".

For information on how to get them directly, see:

* EmacsFromBazaar -- get sources using bzr -- the vcs choosen by the maintainers
* EmacsFromGit -- get sources using git -- another popular vcs

See BuildingEmacs for how to build Emacs from the source package.

See EmacsPretest for information about getting sources snapshots made by the Emacs maintainers before a release.

See the EmacsBzrFeatures for how to find out about new features.

Binary packages built from Bazaar snapshots are available for various systems:

* EmacsApp
* CategoryWThirtyTwo has a list of unofficial Emacs binaries.
