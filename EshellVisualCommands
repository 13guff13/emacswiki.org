Eshell will use `ansi-term' automatically for specific commands, if you
just add them to `eshell-visual-commands'.

    (add-to-list 'eshell-visual-commands "mutt")

If you get a 

     "eterm: unknown term type"

error message, that means you need the /usr/share/terminfo/e/eterm file on your system. On Debian/Ubuntu systems, this file is part of the ncurses-term package.

How can we automate this for all the applications who need it ? -- CamilleBourgoin

How do we get editing in the visual commands?  I get a terminal to work with when I use <code>eshell-visual-commands</code>, but then I can't edit my input to the program (e.g., I see <code>^E</code> instead of moving the cursor to the end of line). Is there a way to get a more capable terminal?  Should we use rlwrap for the sub-program?

Also, what's the difference between <code>eshell-visual-subcommands</code> and <code>eshell-visual-options</code>?  What distinguishes an "option" from a "subcommand"?
