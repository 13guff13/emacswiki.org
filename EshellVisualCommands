Eshell will use `ansi-term' automatically for specific commands, if you
just add them to `eshell-visual-commands'.

    (add-to-list 'eshell-visual-commands "mutt")

If you get a 

     "eterm: unknown term type"

error message, that means you need the /usr/share/terminfo/e/eterm file on your system. On Debian/Ubuntu systems, this file is part of the ncurses-term package.
