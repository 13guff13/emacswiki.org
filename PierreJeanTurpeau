Irregular emacs user since 1995. Now on GNU Emacs 22.2.1 (i386-mingw-nt5.1.2600).

Currently, using it both at work and at home for:

* Personal productivity through org-mode,

* Various developments with C/C++/Java/PHP/xHTML/CSS/SQL/XUL/Javascript/LaTeX languages,

* Social IRC chatting with ERC,

* Keeping up-to-date RSS/newsgroup feeds with Gnus,

* Listening to music with mpg123-mode.


In the future, I would like to improve my Emacs experience on the following subjects:

* Agenda/calendar planning coupled to org-mode,

* Apply GTD methodology on my org-mode usage,

* Switch back to Gnus for mails (I used Gnus until 2002 where I switched to
  netscape and then thunderbird)

* Try various other things like icicles, weather stuffs, yasnippet, re-builder, IdeSkel, HideShow and http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/hideshowvis.el
