The author, JohnPalmieri, says:
: ''Lightning completion is an improvement on whatever completion emacs does already;''
: ''it incorporates dynamic completion: completion without having to hit the TAB key''
: ''or anything else. This is very useful when added to commands like find-file or''
: ''switch-to-buffer or describe-lisp-function.''

Lightning completion is available from http://www.math.washington.edu/~palmieri/Emacs/light.html.

It has not been updated recently (30 September 2005).
