The buffer called <code>*Messages*</code> is GnuEmacs's error log,
where all sorts of useful information is printed, including
information that appears in the EchoArea (except for keystroke echoes).
You can adjust the number of messages kept in the buffer with the
variable <code>message-log-max</code>.

The [[XEmacs]] equivalent of the MessagesBuffer is viewable via `C-h l'.

= Recent Keystrokes =

Use `C-h l' to see the most recent keystrokes (last 100, in
GnuEmacs). This works for both EmacsAndXEmacs. In XEmacs, both
keystrokes and messages are logged to the same list.  In GnuEmacs,
`C-h l' (command `view-lossage') shows only keystrokes and other input
events, not messages, and buffer <code>*Messages*</code> shows only
messages, not keystrokes.
