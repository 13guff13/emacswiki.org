OpenDocument is an ISO standard for the exchange of office documents. Files stored in OpenDocument format (ODF for short) carry the extensions .odt, .odp, .ods, .odg, .odb according to their type (text, presentation, spreadsheet, graphic, database).  More info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument

Many applications support ODF, for instance [[OpenOffice]].

==View and edit OpenDocument files inside Emacs==
From 2006 there is a preliminary support for that.
See odf-mode.el:

==Convert ODT to other formats Emacs can handle==
There is a working program which transforms from odt to [[OrgMode]]; it handles lists, links, images, tables etc. This tool, odt2org, is written in Python and can be downloaded here: http://mantiel.wikidot.com/os:odt2org
It is very useful to have the content in org-mode because then you can export it to many other formats (HTML, PDF, wikis, LaTeX, Docbook, â€¦).
