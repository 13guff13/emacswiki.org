Emacs Wiki should have much better Simplified Chinese translations. UI only, I'm afraid: it only affects the little texts when looking at recent changes, page history, page diff, and the like.
Thank you very much, AndyStewart.
At the same time, the main script should now be able to differentiate between the language preferences of zh-cn (simplified) and zh-tw (traditional).
