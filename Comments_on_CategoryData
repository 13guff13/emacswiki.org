That's a pretty broad category that will have significant overlap with CategoryModes. Maybe we should move some stuff from CategoryModes to this category?

If that's what you want, I could extract the "data" modes from CategoryModes to a DataModes subpage and reference DataModes from the CategoryData page.

As a new user, I was reluctant to shift around the existing organization.

That sounds like an excellent solution.
