In Emacs you can give frames a background color, but you can not do that with windows or buffers.
There has been some discussions on Emacs devel on changing this, but so far no one has had the time to do it.
(Volunteers are welcome! This requires some C coding skills.)

I wrote a little library to work around this.
It uses a simple hack to put background colors in buffers.
