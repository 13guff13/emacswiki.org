==OpenWith==

[http://stud4.tuwien.ac.at/~e0225855/misc/openwith.el OpenWith] minor mode by Markus Triska.

Open files with external applications. Works from everywhere (find-file, dired, etc.).

If you have problems making it work on MS Windows, have a look at [[Sunrise_Commander_Tips#ExternalApps | this tip]].

RunAssoc is a similar (alternative) utility.

I've made a couple of improvements to this, and the author hasn't responded, so I put them up on [https://bitbucket.org/jpkotta/openwith/overview bitbucket].
