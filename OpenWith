==OpenWith==

[http://stud4.tuwien.ac.at/~e0225855/misc/openwith.el OpenWith] minor mode by Markus Triska.

Open files with external applications. Works from everywhere (find-file, dired, etc.).

If you also use emacs for email, you may want to add this to your config:
{{{
(add-to-list  'mm-inhibit-file-name-handlers 'openwith-file-handler)
}}}
Otherwise openwith will wreak havoc with your outbound email attachment workflow.

If you have problems making it work on MS Windows, have a look at [[Sunrise_Commander_Tips#ExternalApps | this tip]].

RunAssoc is a similar (alternative) utility.

I've made a couple of improvements to this, you can find them on [https://bitbucket.org/jpkotta/openwith/overview bitbucket].  It opens things as if you double clicked them in Explorer on Windows, and wraps commands in nohup on Unix so launched processes will not exit if Emacs exits.
