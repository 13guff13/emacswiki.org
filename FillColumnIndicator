Many modern editors and IDEs can graphically indicate the location of the fill column, either by shading the area to the right of the fill column or by drawing a thin line (in design parlance, a "rule") down the length of the editing window.  The package [[fill-column-indicator.el]] (by AlpAker) implements both of these facilities in Emacs.

The two different styles of fill-column indication look like this:

|| [[image:FciShadingStyle]] || [[image:FciRuleStyle]] ||
|| "Shading" style || "Rule" style ||

== Installation and Usage ==

Put the package file in your load path and put ##(require 'fill-column-indicator)## in your .emacs.

To toggle graphical indication of the fill column in a buffer, use the command ##fci-mode##.  

The style of indication is controlled by the variable ##fci-style##.  The recognized values are ##'shading## and ##'rule## (the default value is ##'shading##).  Buffer-local values are supported.

For further customization options, as well as advice on troubleshooting, see the comments in the package file.

* HighlightCurrentColumn -- Highlight the current column when Emacs is idle, or momentarily, or in such a way that the highlighting tracks the cursor. An extension of <tt>[[column-marker.el]]</tt>.
* ModeLinePosition for a way to highlight the column number in the mode-line when the cursor is past some limit column you set.
* MarginMode

===Problems when Using Emacs as a Daemon===
[new]
Really neat stuff :)

I've just spotted a small problem. In order to use with EmacsAsDaemon one needs to comment out these lines:

    (unless window-system
        (error "Fill-column-indicator only works on window systems"))

[Some ensuing back and forth edited out.]  After playing around with EmacsAsDaemon and emacsclient for a while, I think you're right:  The best thing to do is not throw any kind of error when Emacs is running as a daemon, and instead depend on the user to figure out when they can invoke fci-mode and when they can't.  Thanks for pointing out the problem. --AA

===Problem using dabbrev-expand===
[new]
With <tt>fci-mode</tt> active in a buffer, using <tt>dabbrev-expand</tt> at the end of a line seems to jump the point down a couple of lines lines. So a buffer containing:

  abcdef

  abc

  foofoo

Position the point after the second <tt>abc</tt> and use <tt>dabbrev-expand</tt>, I get the correct expansion, but the point jumps to the third <tt>o</tt> in <tt>foofoo</tt>. Without <tt>fdi-mode</tt> I get the correct expansion and the point is left after the expanded <tt>abcdef</tt>.

I've uploaded a new version (0.28) that fixes the bug.  -- AA

The new version (0.28) works great, thanks for the quick fix!

I want the fill-column indicator to be appear at column 80, but it only appears at column 70.  How do I set it to use a different column?

[new:AlpAker:2011-04-05 00:17 UTC]

Fci-mode uses the whatever value you have ##fill-column## set to.  As 70 is the default, you probably haven't set ##fill-column## to your desired value.  You can use the command ##set-fill-column## to change the value of ##fill-column## in a buffer, or put ##(setq-default fill-column 80)## in your .emacs to set it globally. --AA

How can I get the package to work properly on a character terminal?

[new:AlpAker:2011-04-05 00:17 UTC]

When running on a character terminal, Emacs outsources rendering to the terminal emulator; as a result, certain display features aren't supported.  These latter include the overlay properties fci-mode depends on.  The bottom line is that it will only work on window-system displays. --AA

[new:JasonMcBrayer:2011-04-05 12:24 UTC]

Note that on a character terminal, there are other packages you can use. WhiteSpace will optionally highlight lines that are longer than a specific value. It doesn't look as good as FillColumnIndicator, but pretty reasonable for a termainal. I think there are other packages that take a similar approach.
