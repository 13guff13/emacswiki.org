== What is it? ==
A major mode for emacs that provides syntax highlighting for SPARQL. It also provides a way to execute queries against a SPARQL HTTP endpoint, such as is provided by Joseki. It is also possible to query other endpoints like DBPedia. You can find sparql-mode at https://github.com/ljos/sparql-mode .

== Getting Started ==
Download sparql-mode and put it in a directory somewhere.
Add the following to your .emacs file
<code>
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/sparql-mode-dir")
(autoload 'sparql-mode "sparql-mode.el"
  "Major mode for editing SPARQL files" t)
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.sparql$" . sparql-mode))
</code>
Now sparql-mode will load whenever you visit a file whose name ends with .sparql. Alternatively, run M-x sparql-mode in an existing buffer containing SPARQL commands

== Executing SPARQL Queries from within Emacs ==
From a buffer that is in sparql-mode, execute M-x sparql-query-region. You will be prompted for a SPARQL HTTP endpoint in the minibuffer, which defaults to http://localhost:2020/. Once set, it will be used for all subsequent queries in that buffer. Results will be displayed in another buffer in CSV format.
