The current bug tracking system for Emacs is controlled by e-mail. The documentation was sparse, so I figured I'd summarize what I've learned.

==Reporting bugs==
To send a bug report about Emacs, open Emacs and hit M-x report-emacs-bug. Fill in the gaps and send the e-mail. You may also copy the contents of the mail buffer and use your mail client of choice, it doesn't really matter where you send it from.

==Sending patches and other things==
To send a patch to Emacs, send an e-mail to the bug tracking system at submit@emacsbugs.donarmstrong.com. The leading part of the e-mail should contain a few magic words which the system will recognize and tag the generated report with.

===Example 1===
The following is an example of a patch sent to the bug tracking system regarding [[rcirc]].

<pre>
Severity: wishlist
Package: emacs,rcirc

My irc proxy (irssi-proxy) wants a password before allowing connections,
so I added support for this to rcirc.  The patch is attached.

[attached file]
</pre>

The system will recognize that the severity of this report should be "wishlist", which basically means "feature request". The report is also tagged with the packages "emacs" and "rcirc". When someone is looking for reports regarding rcirc, they can simply search for reports tagged with the package name "rcirc".

===Example 2===
The following is a patch for [[ERC]].

<pre>
Package: erc
Version: 5.3
Tags: patch

Connecting to an IRC server with erc-tls rather than erc will produce
an erc session that erc will fail to reconnect to, since erc does not
store the connection method (from `erc-server-connect-function').

In GNU Emacs 23.1.1 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 2.16.6)
 of 2009-09-14 on nautilus, modified by Debian

The following patch fixes this by adding a new erc-session variable
and storing said value in it, and retrieving that valur in the reconnect
function: Limited testing here has shown that it seems to work.

[attached patch]
</pre>

As you can see, it is tagged with "erc" and mentions that the version that the patch is for is 5.3.  It is also tagged with "patch".

==Updating reports==
To update a report, send an e-mail to control@emacsbugs.donarmstrong.com. The leading part of the e-mail, just like when adding reports, should contain keywords that tell the system how to update the report.

* <code>reassign 3923 erc 5.3</code> adds Package: erc and Version: 5.3 to bug report #3923. The version is optional and may therefore be omitted.
* <code>severity 3923 minor</code> sets the severity of bug report #3923 to "minor". The possible severities are ##critical##, ##grave##, ##serious##, ##important##, ##normal##, ##minor##, and ##wishlist##.
* <code>tags 3923 + patch unreproducible</code> adds the ##patch## and ##unreproducible## tags to bug report 3923. Use a hyphen (##-##) instead of a plus to remove tags. Use an equals sign (##=##) to set exactly what tags the report should have.
