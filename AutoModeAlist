The [::auto-mode-alist] variable is an AssociationList that associates [[MajorMode]]s with a pattern to match a buffer filename when it is first opened.  See SetAutoMode.

Something like this:

   (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.py\\'" . python-mode))

Where `python-mode' is a function that is either AutoLoad""ed or already defined.

Note that ##\'## matches the end of a string, where as ##$## matches the empty string before a newline.
Thus, ##$## may lead to unexpected behavior when dealing with filenames containing newlines.
(Should be pretty rare...  ;))

If you write your own major mode that associate with a file extension,
here is what you do:

# Put some documentation in the commentary section.
# As part of the documentation, your users should:
## add the file to a directory in their LoadPath
## add the following lines to their InitFile:

    (autoload 'foo-mode "foo" "Some documentation." t)
    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.foo\\'" . foo-mode))

The autoload expression makes sure that the library "foo" is loaded when
the function `foo-mode' is called.  Use `M-x locate-library RET foo RET'
to figure out what file this will be.  The last parameter says that
foo-mode is interactive.  Most major modes are.

The add-to-list expression associates the .foo extension with foo-mode.
The ##\\'## matches the end of the filename; a $ would match newlines within
filenames (true, this should be rare...  ;)).
