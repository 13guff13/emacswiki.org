== Emacs chess library and client ==

JohnWiegley has written a chess mode.
It plays against crafty and gnuchess.
You can also play on Interenet Chess Servers, like FICS.

== Crafty ==

A possible computer oponent if you are not playing against a fellow
human.

== Internet Chess Servers ==

MarkOakden has written an emacs mode for communication with internet 
chess servers (FICS http://www.freechess.org , ICC 
http://www.chessclub.com, etc.)  It handles the text part of the session, 
so unless you like playing in ASCII, you'll still need a board such as
XBoard ( http://www.tim-mann.org/chess )

* ics.el is available from http://www.oakden.org/mark/sw/icsel

The chess.el project also contains an unrelated implementation of ICS
communication, called chess-ics.el.  To startup chess.el against
a ICS server, use C-u M-x chess RET ics RET
