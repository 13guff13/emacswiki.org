 ;;; Commentary:

 ;; The function `hide-region-hide' hides the region. You can hide many
 ;; different regions and they will be "marked" by two configurable
 ;; strings (so that you know where the hidden text is).

 ;; The hidden regions is pushed on a kind of hide-region "ring".

 ;; The function `hide-region-unhide' "unhides" one region, starting
 ;; with the last one you hid.

 ;; The best is to try it out.
