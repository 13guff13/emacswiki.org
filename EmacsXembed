= Emacs and Xembed =

GNU Emacs 23.1 supports the XEmbed specification. You can embed Emacs in another application on X11.  The command line option --parent-id is used to pass the parent window id to Emacs.  See http://standards.freedesktop.org/xembed-spec/xembed-spec-latest.html for details about XEmbed.

== embedding emacs in other apps ==

currently I have no good example of how this works with existing apps, but I made a small
gtk app that creates a gtk_socket, and prints the window id of that socket.
When the program runs, emacs can be started with the --parent-id flag with the socket id, and 
emacs shows up in the demo app. Cool!

It would be very cool to embed Emacs into [[http://www.srware.net/en/software_srware_iron.php Iron]] or Firefox so every TEXTAREA would be governed by Emacs. Maybe [[http://people.ksp.sk/~martin/firefox/extensions/EmbeddedEditor/ EmbeddedEditor]] can be updated to do this. I tried it at some point but I could not get it to work properly.

I created a small [[http://bitbucket.org/ArneBab/kembed-emacs/src/tip/qxembed-emacs.py proof-of-concept PyQt4]] program which just opens a window and embeds emacs in it. 


== embedding apps in emacs windows ==
The xwidget patch enables embedding of gtk widgets inside emacs buffers.

mplayer could be embeded in emacs, using mplayers -wid flag, emacs and uzbl are other xembed compatible apps.

Currently im investigating if its possible to embed generic gtk widgets in a buffer. Then xembed would be solved as well, because of gtk_socket. This is probably rather difficult, but even more interesting than plain xembed
support. The interface is currently similar to the image support, ie, one puts a display property with an "xwidget" spec on it, on some text. The interface would be toolkit neutral:

(xwidget :type embed ...) etc, different types for different interesting widgets.

Im now able to have a gtk button move with the text in emacs, just like an image!

[[image:EmacsXembedScreenshot]]

Its very cool!

== getting the code ==

I've now created an "xwidget" branch in the savannah emacs bzr repo, and the code will live there now.

http://bzr.savannah.gnu.org/lh/emacs/xwidget/files

== The interface ==

Heres stuff from my elisp test code:

(insert "xwidgetdemo<<< a button. another button\n")
(goto-char (point-min))
(put-text-property (point) (+ 1 (point)) 'display '(xwidget :xwidget-id 1 :type 'webkit-osr :title "1" :width 40 :height 50))

xwidget-id must be a unique integer. type identifies the widget class.


Callbacks are handled with the Emacs even system.

== Notes and Status ==

This page should probably be split into this page and EmacsXwidgets.

Xwidgets is a concept similar to the Java AWT toolkit, but instead for Elisp.
The current implementation of Xwidgets targets GTK as the native peer widget set, but
aims to be toolkit agnostic. I dont aim to make every GTK widget an Xwidget, just a small
subset suitable to implement certain types of GUI:s currently difficult to do with Emacs,
for instance slider widgets, embedded applications, etc.


Currently the patch allows for:
* inserting xwidgets: button, toggle button, slider, xembed socket, webkit view, and some rudimentary canvas experiments(clutter, goocanvas)
* moving them by inserting text, just like images
* an emacs event based callback interface
* an MVC model for sliders. Each time you split a window you get new sliders on screen. they are kept in sync
* an offscreen rendering webkit xwidget. so, you can have a decent html renderer inside Emacs.

Current issues:
* theres a problem with clipping on emacs-window borders(topmost. left and bottom seems ok now
* xwidgets are not garbed currently, they are just hidden.
* theres just a fixed array of xwidgets, not a proper list

These issues appear difficult but not unsolveable.


I seem to code on this on yearly sprints. 2011 has been fruitful for xwidgets.
