: Welcome to the wiki!  :)  I like the idea of "a-menu.el" on your homepage, by the way.  Very neat idea.  Oh and if you want to improve the Japanese interface [http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs-ja] just let me know! -- AlexSchroeder

Hi, thank you for setting an alias. :-)

: CarbonEmacsPackage is awesome!  Just wanted to make you know.  :) -- AlexSchroeder

Hi. I just gave ##a-menu.el## a try. As soon as I tried ##(a-menu "c:/some/directory")## I got an error because one of the subdirectories has a space in its name:

 Signaling: (void-variable Nov)
   (setq menu-bar-c:/drews-lisp-20/CONTRIB/psgml-1\.2\.5/TESTS Nov 13-menu (make-sparse-keymap))

The directory in question is this: ##c:/drews-lisp-20/CONTRIB/psgml-1.2.5/TESTS Nov 13##

It looks like you might need to escape space characters. HTH -- DrewAdams
