*mu4e* is a new emacs-based e-mail client. It's based on the [http://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu mu] e-mail indexer/searcher. It focuses on being a super-efficient tool to withstand the daily e-mail tsunami. 

==Features==
* Fully search-based: there are no folders, only queries
* Fully documented, with example configurations
* User-interface optimized for speed, with quick key strokes for common actions
* Asynchronous; heavy actions don’t block emacs
* Support for non-English languages ("angstrom" will match "Ångström")
* Support for crypto
* Writing rich-text e-mails using org-mode
* Address auto-completion based on your messages
* Extensible with your own code

It's pretty new - it's first release is as part of mu 0.9.8, end of January 2012. I've been happily using it for a few months; hopefully it works well for others as well.
