*mu4e* is a new emacs-based e-mail client. It's based on the [http://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu mu] e-mail indexer/searcher. It focuses on being a super-efficient tool to withstand the daily e-mail tsunami. 

==Features==
* completely search based, yet allowing for folder-based operation
* search based on subject, sender, recipient (to, cc, bcc), date interval, message flags, attachment name and mime-type, etc.
* support for bookmarks and quickly navigating your mails using only two keystrokes (like dired)
* support for non-english languages -- so angstrom will match Ångström
* fully documented

==Links==
* source code (part of mu): https://github.com/djcb/mu
* homepage, screenshots: http://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html
* documentation: http://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e/index.html 

It's pretty new - it's first release is as part of mu 0.9.8, end of January 2012. I've been happily using it for a few months; hopefully it works well for others as well.
