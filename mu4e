*mu4e* is an emacs-based e-mail client. It's based on the [http://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu mu] e-mail indexer/searcher. It attempts to be a super-efficient tool to withstand the daily e-mail tsunami. 

To quote Prof. Shirky: /It's not information overload. It's filter failure/. mu4e's mission is to be a better filter. 

==Features==
* Fully search-based: there are no folders, only queries 
* Fully documented, with example configurations
* User-interface optimized for speed, with quick key strokes for common actions
* Asynchronous; heavy actions don’t block emacs
* Support for non-English languages ("angstrom" will match "Ångström")
* Support for signing and encryption
* Address auto-completion based on your existihng messages
* Extensible with your own code
