Arch is a sophisticated modern source-control system (see ArchVersionControl for more details).

MilesBader has made a new arch repository for the Emacs development branches on
savannah.gnu.org, using savannah's new arch support.

It is writable by any emacs hacker with write-access to the emacs
project on savannah (it uses the same ssh key that CVS access uses);
there's also read-only version available anonymously via http.

Miles will synchronize the arch branches with the corresponding CVS branches
on Savannah.  That means that any emacs hacker
who wishes to use arch instead of CVS can do so fairly easily.

See http://savannah.gnu.org/maintenance/UsingGnuArch for some more help.

This is a signed archive, so to use it, you'll have to have the GPG keys
for the committer of any revisions you check out, which is kind of a
pain.  Mostly this means my keys, but possibly anybody else who commits
revisions.

A reasonably easy way to get keys is to use gpg's key-server support,
e.g. to search for my keys:

   gpg --search-keys --keyserver pgp.mit.edu miles@gnu.org

and to search for Stefan's:

   gpg --search-keys --keyserver pgp.mit.edu monnier@iro.umontreal.ca


The branches listed below  regularly merge from the CVS trunk branch, and so are up-to-date with respect to new features on the trunk:


; emacs--unicode--0: The "unicode" branch, which uses a unicode-based internal character encoding (an extension of <nowiki>utf-8</nowiki>) instead of the current emacs-specific coding.  This branch will be the next major release of GNU Emacs (version 23).

; emacs--lexbind--0: The "lexbind" branch is MilesBader's version of Emacs using lexically scoped variables in lisp.

; emacs--tiling--0: The "tiling" branch allows face backgrounds to use images as well as simple colors (including, most importantly, the default face).

; emacs--devo--0: The canonical development branch
; gnus--devo--0: The canonical [[Gnus]] development branch
; gnus--rel--5.10: The 5.10 [[Gnus]] release branch

There's also KarolyLorentey's multi-tty branch, which allows a single GNU Emacs process to display on multiple terminals (and in X windows) simultaneously; see MultiTTYSupport.

== Basic Instructions ==

To use tla to get the emacs sources, do the following.

If you're a developer with write access (where $USER is your savannah
user-name):

    tla register-archive sftp://$USER@arch.sv.gnu.org/archives/emacs    

If you want read-only access:

    tla register-archive http://arch.sv.gnu.org/archives/emacs

The following will then checkout emacs into a directory called
"<tt>emacs</tt>".

    tla get emacs@sv.gnu.org/emacs--devo--0 emacs

=SXEmacs=

[[SXEmacs]] is maintained officially using GnuArch.

The official branch is at the time of this writing <tt>steve@sxemacs.org--2007/sxemacs--main--22.1.7</tt>
